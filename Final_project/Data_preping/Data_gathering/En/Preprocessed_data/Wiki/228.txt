birmingham accident hospital formerly known as birmingham accident hospital and rehabilitation centre was established in april as birmingham s response to two reports the british medical association s committee on fractures and the interdepartmental committee on the rehabilitation of persons injured by accidents
both organisations recommended specialist treatment and rehabilitation facilities
the hospital generally recognized as the world s first trauma centre used the existing buildings of queen s hospital a former teaching hospital in bath row birmingham england in the united kingdom
it changed its name to birmingham accident hospital in and closed in
a listed building it is now part of queens hospital close a student accommodation complex
a blue plaque commemorates its former role
earl howe laid the foundation stone of the royal school of medicine and surgery in birmingham s new teaching hospital on june the building being completed the following year at a cost of
henry pepys the anglican lord bishop of worcester presided over the ceremony formally opening the bed hospital
the hospital s first president was prince albert
upon his death in december the post remained vacant until when lord leigh was appointed to the position
this building was designed by bateman and drury and is a grade ii listed building
the hospital expanded rapidly
by separate wards were added containing beds for infectious and contagious disease cases raising hospital capacity to
in adjacent grounds were purchased and in lord leigh laid the foundation stone for a new outpatient department originally known as the workmen s extension as it was funded by local working people to the strains of a hymn written for the occasion by the rev
charles kingsley and sung by child choristers from the birmingham schools choral union
this building was designed by martin chamberlain and is also grade ii listed
it opened for patients on november
in queen s became a free hospital abandoning the previous system whereby the hospital s financial supporters issued subscriber s tickets to authorise treatment
a one shilling admission fee was charged but could be waived
in patients were treated at queen s but by the patient count had more than doubled to composed of inpatients and outpatients
average annual expenditure from to was against average receipts leaving an average annual deficit of covered by endowments and donations
in william humble ward nd earl of dudley took over the presidency of the hospital
a new block opened in with three stories of wards as well as a roof ward for six patients the first of its kind in europe
the integrated nursing home s capacity increased from to beds and the hospital itself now had medical and surgical beds totalling
bed count and services provided continued to expand until closure
queen s remained a teaching hospital until the queen elizabeth hospital birmingham opened
the outbreak of war however delayed the planned partial redeployment of the building as an accident hospital
in the opportunity was taken for birmingham to address the problems of delay in treatment of serious injuries
accidents in birmingham had risen by as inexperienced workers entered wartime factories
birmingham accident hospital and rehabilitation centre as it became was thus the last voluntary hospital in the country and its specified objectives included prevention of industrial accidents
its surgeon in chief and clinical director was professor william gissane
according to former consultant surgeon keith porter the hospital had eight wards and there were usually around staff working there at any one time
on august the president of the hospital the lord mayor of birmingham welcomed the minister of health sir henry willink at the opening of a new reception area and outpatients department
willink said the accident hospital experiment was being closely watched and was likely to have a permanent future in hospital services
referring to the beveridge report and his own white paper he said he recognised the close co operation between the university the city authorities and the hospital and hoped that this spirit of co operation would pervade the future national health service
the parliamentary secretary to the minister of labour george tomlinson described rehabilitation as one of the great social advances which has emerged from this war
he added that only of the disabled and unemployed remained so
whilst infection was known in the th century as a dangerous complication in severe burns until the s its significance was regarded as secondary
it was only after treatment for shock was available that it became recognised as the main cause of death
whilst initially a burn is likely to be sterile it will quickly become colonised from external sources usually other patients in the same ward
prevention of cross infection was therefore a key objective
in sir ashley miles professor of bacteriology at university college hospital medical school and a member of the war wounds committee worked as part time director of the hospital s mrc unit
he left in eventually becoming director of the lister institute of preventive medicine
in leonard colebrook an expert on the earliest antibiotic prontosil active against streptococcus moved with his burns unit from glasgow royal infirmary
a joint project led to the development of mrc cream no the main burns treatment at that time
colebrook established the practice of placing the patients in a near sterile environment
his political campaigning against unguarded fires and inflammable children s nightwear led to the heating appliances and fireguards act
in edward lowbury succeeded colebrook as head of bacteriology
in the s and s as one of the foremost researchers in hospital infection particularly in the prevention of burns infection the problems of antibiotic resistance and skin disinfection he lectured around the world
clinical trials confirmed colebrooke s work showing that specialist positively pressurised dressing rooms reduced infections
with john babb he proved that a specialised filter system could remove bacteria from an airstream and retain them either reducing infection risk or allowing an already infected patient to be treated in an open ward
he documented treatment of infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa noting that the development of carbenicillin resistance used a single mechanism which conferred protection against a range of antibiotics
he further showed that overuse of a new antibiotic led to increased staphylococcus resistance and that a subsequent reduction in use reversed the effect
his work with rod jones contributed to the development of a pseudomonas vaccine
with harold lilly he developed tests for effectiveness of hand washes before alcohol became the norm in
these tests were still the basis for european standards when he died in
he worked on topical antibacterial compounds with surgeons douglas jackson and jack cason eventually leading to topical silver which was still in use at his death
in dr simon sevitt set up a pathology department that covered bacteriology haematology biochemistry histology
and morbid anatomy
though his best known work was in venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism fat embolism and the healing of fractures he was to become an outstanding pathologist particularly in accident surgery
his controversial paper on thromboembolism after fracture of the hip in old people written in conjunction with gallagher which found that
fatal pulmonary embolism might occur days or more after surgery for hip fracture
triggered work by other researchers and revolutionised the profession s attitude to preventing diagnosing and
treating the condition
dr sevitt died in september
by before the introduction of crash helmets uk road injuries were increasing rapidly
motorcyclists alone accounted for over uk deaths
compared to the road user total of just
research work at the birmingham accident hospital improved the treatment of injury immeasurably alan ruscoe clarke studied haemorrhagic shock for different types of injury and showed that the lethal collapse of blood volume was caused by swellings around a fracture or burn and not by blood becoming temporarily static in the capillaries
immediate transfusion and surgery reversed or delayed the illness of trauma and was essential
in his lecture to the st
john ambulance brigade surgeons conference in harrogate ruscoe clarke described the old theory of shock and why it failed
despite the success of james blundell with blood transfusions saline solution was the standard substitute from to
surgeon ernest cowell writing in the british official history of the great war described the results of saline solution at the battle of the somme as most disappointing
canadian surgeons recommended whole blood transfusions though volumes used were small even the largest transfusions used were only about a litre
treatment of shock from was based on observations of cowell and walter bradford cannon
however plasma volume measurements suggested that more blood was disappearing from the circulation than could be accounted for
since it was in neither the veins nor the arteries it was assumed to be temporarily immobilised throughout the capillary system
treatment was therefore aimed at encouraging blood to return to the circulation by heating the patient rubbing the limbs and providing hot sweet tea intended to increase circulation volume
the large transfusions made possible by the development of blood banks in the s transformed many patients
in alfred blalock proposed that shock was caused by bleeding a view accepted by various authorities by
the war injuries study of grant and reeve published recommended early transfusions for large wounds and suggested existing theories were inadequate
ruscoe clarke further described how observations at the birmingham accident hospital on peacetime accident victims confirmed grant and reeve s work and provided evidence to reject the old capillary theory
their work showed that blood was missing from the circulation just as often in closed fractures as in open wounds that the blood lost appeared proportional to the severity of the wound and that the swelling of the injury frequently corresponded to the volume of blood lost
blood loss from open wounds similarly matched blood lost from circulation
blood losses had been consistently underestimated in the past but the provision of large transfusions during the korean war had saved people with injuries who would not otherwise have survived
he recommended that where significant blood loss had occurred even over an extended period of time the patient should be transferred to expert medical care and receive an immediate transfusion
there was no place for hot tea heat treatment or massage which delayed proper treatment
in professor gissane became honorary director of the road injuries research group which investigated and analysed accidents on the newly opened m motorway at a time before seat belts were mandatory
gissane believed risks of accidents occurring were lower on motorways but the consequences were more serious
a further study of all deaths from road accidents in certain areas and periods suggested lorries were the main cause of car fatalities on motorways and link roads and that seatbelts provided little protection available for the car occupants
uk lorries are now fitted with an impact absorbing rear barrier meeting one of the recommendations
investigation techniques included interviews with police hospitals survivors and coroners to study ways in which vehicle design could be changed to avoid accidents in the first place and to mitigate the injuries caused
speaking in the former director of the hospital s research unit dr john bull credited the unit with calling for mandatory seatbelt installation in new vehicles and compulsory wearing of motorbike crash helmets
the aa provided some money for research
the birmingham pub bombings was the worst terrorist attack in great britain until the july london bombings
taxi cabs and all available ambulances ferried victims to either the accident hospital or to birmingham general hospital
accident hospital switchboards were jammed as a total of victims were brought in
speaking in roger farell the head of medical records described how he set off for work immediately on seeing the tv newsflash
injuries included wood and glass shards which cannot be detected by x rays and some victims were rendered unrecognisable
drinkers at the tavern in the town pub which was located underground suffered very severe blast injuries
the only fortuitous aspect was the geographical location of the blast within a mile of a hospital housing the only specialised burns unit in the country at the time
the very worst cases went into the world leading major injuries unit though nine of the twelve died
