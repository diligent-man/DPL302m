— Atheism Among the People by Alphonse de Lamartine pp Alphonse de Lamartine as quoted in A Priest by Robert Nash on Catholic priests
There is a man in every parish having no family but belonging to a family that is worldwide who is called in as a witness and adviser in all the important affairs of human life No one comes into the world or goes out of it without his ministrations He takes the child from its mother’s arms and parts with him only at the grave He blesses and consecrates the cradle the bridal chamber the bed of death and the bier He is one whom innocent children instinctively venerate and reverence and to whom men of venerable age come to seek for wisdom and call him father at whose feet men fall down and lay bare the innermost thoughts of their souls and weep their most sacred tears He is one whose mission is to console the afflicted and soften the pains of body and soul to whose door come alike the rich and the poor He belongs to no social class because he belongs equally to all He is one in fine who knows all has a right to speak unreservedly and whose speech inspired from on high falls on the minds and hearts of all with the authority of one who is divinely sent and with the constraining power of one who has an unclouded faithIn his book Histoire de la Turquie Alphonse de Lamartine writes
If greatness of purpose smallness of means and astounding results are the three criteria of human genius who could dare to compare any great man in modern history with Muhammad The most famous men created arms laws and empires only They founded if anything at all no more than material powers which often crumbled away before their eyes This man moved not only armies legislation empires peoples and dynasties but millions of men in one third of the then inhabited world and more than that he moved the altars the gods the religions the ideas the beliefs and souls His forbearance in victory his ambition which was entirely devoted to one idea and in no manner striving for an empire his endless prayers his mystic conversations with God his death and his triumph after death all these attest not to an imposture but to a firm conviction which gave him the power to restore a dogma This dogma was two fold the unity of God and the immateriality of God the former telling what God is the latter telling what God is not the one overthrowing false gods with the sword the other starting an idea with the words Philosopher orator apostle legislator warrior conqueror of ideas restorer of rational beliefs of a cult without images the founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual empire that is Muhammad As regards all standards by which human greatness may be measured we may well ask is there any man greater than heFrench demonstration of May
