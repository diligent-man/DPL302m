modern man continued inhabit peninsula mesolithic neolithic periods
many best preserved prehistoric remains atapuerca region rich limestone cave preserved million year human evolution
among site cave gran dolina six hominin skeleton dated million year ago found in
expert debated whether skeleton belong specie homo erectus homo heidelbergensis new specie called homo antecessor
gran dolina investigator found evidence tool use butcher animal hominins likely constitute first evidence cannibalism hominin species
evidence fire ha also found site suggesting cooked meat
also atapuerca site sima de los huesos pit bones
remains tentatively classified homo heidelbergensis may ancestor neanderthals
evidence habitation ha found site except one stone hand-ax remains site young adult teenagers
seemingly deliberate placement remains lack habitation may mean body deliberately interred pit place burial would make site first evidence hominin burial

around bc interstadial deglaciation called allerd oscillation occurred weakening rigorous condition last ice age
climatic change also represents end upper palaeolithic period beginning epipaleolithic
depending terminology preferred particular source mesolithic begin epipaleolithic includes it
climate became warmer late magdalenian people iberia modified technology culture
main techno-cultural change process microlithization reduction size stone bone tool also found part world
also cave sanctuary seem abandoned art becomes rarer mostly done portable object pebble tools
also implies change diet megafauna virtually disappears steppe becomes woodlands
period hunted animal smaller size typically deer wild goat seafood becomes important part diet available
first epipaleolithic culture azilian also known microlaminar microlithism mediterranean
culture local evolution magdalenian parallel regional derivative found central northern europe
originally found old magdalenian territory vasco-cantabria wider franco-cantabrian region azilian-style culture eventually expanded part mediterranean iberia well
reflected much warmer climate leading thick woodland replacement large herd animal smaller elusive forest-dwellers
archetypical azilian site iberian peninsula zatoya navarre difficult discern early azilian element late magdalenian transition dated bp
full azilian site dated bp followed appearance geometric element later date continue arrival pottery subneolithic stage
mediterranean area virtually material culture often named microlaminar microlithism lack bone industry typical franco-cantabrian azilian
found part catalonia valencian community murcia mediterranean andalusia
asturian culture wa successor azilian moved slightly west whose distinctive tool wa pick-axe picking limpet rocks
late phase epipaleolithic new trend arrives north geometrical microlithism directly related sauveterrian tardenoisian culture rhine-danube region
franco-cantabrian region ha minor impact altering azilian culture substantially mediterranean iberia portugal arrival noticeable
filador facies directly related french sauveterrian found catalonia north ebro river
cocina facies widespread many site mlaga spain show strong dependence fishing seafood gathering
portuguese site south tagus muge group given date c rock art found site along eastern side iberia advanced widespread surviving period certainly europe arguably world
strikingly different upper palaeolithic art found along northern coast narrative scene large number small sketchily painted human figure rather superbly observed individual animal figure characterise earlier period

origin uncertain though north africa serious candidate arrive already developed crop cereal legumes
presence domestic animal instead unlikely pig rabbit remains found could belong wild animals
also consumed large amount olive uncertain whether tree wa cultivated merely harvested wild form
typical artifact la almagra style pottery quite variegated
andalusian neolithic also influenced area notably southern portugal soon arrival agriculture first dolmen tomb begin built c
bc cardium pottery neolithic culture also known mediterranean neolithic arrives eastern iberia
remains culture found far west portugal distribution basically mediterranean catalonia valencian region ebro valley balearic islands
interior northern coastal area remain largely marginal process spread agriculture

gordon childe interpreted presence characteristic artefact intrusion missionary expanding iberia along atlantic coast spreading knowledge mediterranean copper metallurgy
stephen shennan interpreted artefact belonging mobile cultural elite imposing indigenous substrate populations
similarly sangmeister interpreted beaker folk glockenbecherleute small group highly mobile trader artisans
christian strahm used term bell beaker phenomenon glockenbecher-phnomen compromise order avoid term culture
bell beaker artefact least early phase distributed across contiguous areal usual archaeological culture found insular concentration scattered across europe
however bell beaker culture doe appear coalesce coherent archaeological culture later phase
recent analysis beaker phenomenon published since persisted describing origin beaker phenomenon arising synthesis element representing idea style uniting different region different cultural tradition background
found limited genetic affinity individual associated beaker complex iberia central europe suggesting migration played limited role early spread iberia
however study found dissemination mature beaker complex wa strongly linked migration
spread fluidity beaker culture back forth rhine origin source peninsula may introduced high level steppe-related ancestry resulting near-complete transformation local gene pool within century point replacement local mesolithic-neolithic patrilineal lineages
origin bell beaker artefact ha traced early rd millennium
earliest example maritime bell beaker design found tagus estuary portugal radiocarbon dated c
inspiration maritime bell beaker argued small earlier copoz beaker impressed decoration found widely around tagus estuary portugal
turek ha recorded late neolithic precursor northern africa arguing maritime style emerged result seaborne contact iberia morocco first half third millennium bce

significant chalcolithic archeological site portugal castro vila nova de pedro
megalith created period started earlier late lasting early nd millennium bc
castelo velho de freixo de numo vila nova de foz ca municipality wa populated bc
cerro castelo de santa justa alcoutim dated rd millennium bc bc
also period great expansion megalithism associated collective burial practices
early chalcolithic period cultural phenomenon maybe religious undertone expands along atlantic region also south peninsula additionally also found virtually european atlantic regions
another phenomenon found early chalcolithic development new type funerary monument tholoi artificial caves
found developed area southern iberia tagus estuary almera se france
important one los millares se spain zambujal belonging vila nova de pedro culture portuguese estremadura well called civilization even lack literary component
unclear cultural influence originated eastern mediterranean cyprus could sparked civilizations
one side tholos doe precedent area even used yet tomb material evidence exchange eastern western mediterranean contrast abundance good imported northern europe africa
early corded style beaker quite clear central european origin peninsula begin producing type bell beaker pottery
important maritime international style associated especially megalithism century abundant peninsula southern france
bc bell beaker phenomenon iberia show regionalization different style produced various region palmela type portugal continental type plateau almerian type los millares among others
like part europe bell beaker phenomenon speculated trading maybe religious nature doe significantly alter culture insert in
instead cultural context existed previously continue basically unchanged presence
civilization los millares wa followed el argar initially discontinuity displacement main urban center kilometer north gradual appearance true bronze arsenical bronze tool greater geographical extension
argarian people lived rather large fortified town cities
town smaller show intense interaction neighbor el argar
poorly defined archaeological horizon show bronze dagger expansive trend northward
cogotas culture cogotas ii iron age celtic pastoral people plateau become first time culturally unified
typical artifact rough troncoconic potterysome area like civilization vila nova seem remained apart spread bronze metallurgy remaining technically chalcolithic period centuries
noticeable change happens el argar civilization adopts aegean custom burial pithoi
northwest galicia northern portugal region held largest reserve tin needed make true bronze western eurasia became focus mining incorporating bronze technology
semi-desert region la mancha show first sign colonization fortified scheme motillas hillforts
group clearly related bronze levante showing material culture
bc several major change happen iberia among them
chalcolithic culture vila nova vanishes possibly direct relation silting canal connecting main city zambujal sea
replaced non-urban culture whose main artifact externally burnished pottery
el argar also disappears homogeneous culture centralized state becomes array many post-argaric fortified cities
proto-celtic urnfield culture appears north-east conquering catalonia neighbouring areas
lower guadalquivir valley show first clearly differentiated culture defined internally burnished pottery
western iberian bronze culture show degree interaction among also atlantic culture britain france elsewhere
ha called atlantic bronze complexiron age iberia ha two focus hallstatt-related urnfields north-east phoenician colony south
iron age considered protohistory territory celt came several wave possibly starting bc
southwest paleohispanic script tartessian seen algarve lower alentejo late century bc possibly oldest script western europe
since late century bc urnfield culture north-east iberia began develop iron metallurgy eventually element hallstatt culture
earliest element culture found along lower ebro river gradually expanded upstream la rioja hybrid local form alava
wa also expansion southward castell le marked influence reaching south
offshoot detected along iberian mountain possibly prelude formation celtiberi
period social differentiation became visible evidence local chiefdoms horse-riding elite
transformation may represent arrival new wave culture central europe
outpost upper ebro iberian mountain celtic culture expanded plateau atlantic coast
bernorio-miraveche group northern burgos palencia province would influence people northern fringe
northwest castro culture galicia northern portugal celtic culture peculiarity due persistence aspect earlier atlantic bronze age culture
cogotas ii culture likely precursor celtic celtiberian vettones pre-celtic culture substantial celtic influence markedly cattle-herder culture gradually expanded southward extremadura
lusitanian culture precursor lusitani tribe central portugal extremadura western spain
generally considered celtic since lusitanian doe meet accepted definition celtic language
believe wa essentially pre-celtic iberian culture substantial celtic influence others argue wa essentially celtic culture strong indigenous pre-celtic influences
argument classifying language either italic form archaic celtic proto-celticall indo-european group common element like combed pottery since century uniform weaponry
bc urnfields north-east replaced iberian culture process completed century bc
physical separation continental relative would mean celt iberian peninsula never received cultural influence la tne culture including druidism
phoenician levant greek europe carthaginian africa colonized part iberia facilitate trade
century bc first contact phoenician iberia along mediterranean coast made
century also saw emergence town city southern littoral area eastern iberia
foundation cdiz oldest continuously inhabited city western europe traditionally dated bc though archaeological discovery date back century bc
phoenician continued use cdiz trading post several century leaving variety artifact notably pair sarcophagus around rd century bc
contrary myth record phoenician colony west algarve namely tavira though might voyage discovery
phoenician influence portugal wa essentially cultural commercial exchange tartessos
century bc phoenician city-state tyre founded colony malaka mlaga carthage north africa
century phoenician also great influence iberia introduction use iron potter's wheel production olive oil wine
also responsible first form iberian writing great religious influence accelerated urban development
however real evidence support myth phoenician foundation city lisbon far back bc name ali ubbo safe harbour even period organized settlement olissipona modern lisbon portuguese estremadura mediterranean influences
wa strong phoenician influence settlement city balsa modern tavira algarve century bc
decadence phoenician colonization mediterranean coast iberia century bc many colony deserted
century bc also saw rise colonial might carthage slowly replaced phoenician former area dominion
greek colony marseille began trading iberian eastern coast around century bc
greek finally founded colony ampurias eastern mediterranean shore modern catalonia century bc beginning settlement iberian peninsula
evidence support myth ancient greek founding olissipo modern lisbon odysseus
name tartessian applied archaeology linguistics doe necessarily correlate semi-mythical city tartessos roughly area typically assumed been
tartessian culture southern iberia actually local culture modified increasing influence eastern mediterranean element especially phoenician
core area western andalusia soon extends eastern andalusia extremadura land murcia valencia tartessian complex rooted local bronze culture last stage bronze age - century bc phoenician influence seen clearly
full tartessian culture beginning c bc also extends southern portugal eventually replaced lusitanian culture
one significant element culture introduction potter's wheel along related technical development cause major improvement quality pottery
latter aspect especially important traditional circular hut gradually replaced well finished rectangular buildings
also allowed construction tower-like burial monument typical culture
agriculture also seems experienced major advance introduction steel tool presumably yoke animal traction plow
period noticeable increase cattle accompanied decrease sheep goat types
another noticeable element major increase economical specialization social stratification
noticeable burial show great wealth chariot gold ivory vast majority much modest
much diversity burial ritual period elite seem converge one single style chambered mound
one development period writing skill wa probably acquired contact phoenicians
koch controversially claimed deciphered extant tartessian inscription tentatively identified language earlier form celtic language spoken british isle brittany book 'celtic west' published in
however linguistic mainstream continues treat tartessian unclassified possibly pre-indo-european language koch's decipherment tartessian script theory evolution celtic ha strongly criticized
three phase identified ancient middle late iberian period
arrival greek influence limited colony tartessian culture begin transform especially south east
late period known iberian culture western andalusia non-celtic area extremadura called ibero-turdetanian stronger link tartessian substrate
greek influence visible gradual change style monument approach model arrived greek world
thus obelisk-like funerary monument previous period adopt column like form totally line greek architecture
mid century aristocratic power wa increased resulted abandonment transformation orientalizing model
commerce wa also one principal source aristocratic control power
southeast end end century bc appeared highly hierarchical aristocratic society
iberian funerary custom dominated cremation necropolis partly due persistent influence urnfield culture also include burial custom imported greek cultural area mudbrick rectangular mound
urbanism wa important iberian cultural area especially south roman account mention hundred oppida fortified towns
town quite large mere fortified village house typically arranged contiguous block seems another urnfield cultural influx
iberian script evolved tartessian one greek influence noticeable transformation characters
case variant greek alphabet ibero-ionian script wa used write iberian well
transformation tartessian iberian culture wa sudden gradual wa marked east begin century bc south-west noticeable since century bc much tenuous
special case northeast urnfield culture wa iberized keeping element indo-european substrate
also century bc wa cultural shift southwest iberia southern portugal nearby part andalusia tartessos fell strong mediterranean character prolonged modified tartessian culture
occurred mainly low alentejo algarve littoral extension sado mouth namely important city bevipo modern alccer sal
first form writing western iberia south portugal southwest paleohispanic script still translated dated century bc denotes strong tartessian influence use modified phoenician alphabet
writing word conii similar cunetes cynetes people algarve appears frequently
century bc celtici appear late expansion celtic culture southwest southern extremadura alentejo northern algarve
turduli turdetani probably descendant tartessians though celticized became established area guadiana river southern portugal
series city algarve balsa tavira baesuris castro marim ossonoba faro cilpes silves became inhabited cynetes
century bc rome began rise mediterranean power rival north african based carthage
suffering defeat roman first punic war bc carthaginian began extend power interior iberia south eastern coastal settlement empire wa short lived
second punic war bc carthaginian general hannibal marched army included iberian iberia across pyrenees alp attacked roman italy
