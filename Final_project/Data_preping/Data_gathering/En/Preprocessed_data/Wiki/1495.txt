the prehistory of the iberian peninsula begins with the arrival of the first hominins million years ago and ends with the punic wars when the territory enters the domains of written history
in this long period some of its most significant landmarks were to host the last stand of the neanderthal people to develop some of the most impressive paleolithic art alongside southern france to be the seat of the earliest civilizations of western europe and finally to become a most desired colonial objective due to its strategic position and its many mineral riches
the first inhabitation by humans of the iberian peninsula dates from the paleolithic
early hominin remains have been discovered at a number of sites on the peninsula
significant evidence of an extended occupation of iberia by neanderthal man has also been discovered
homo sapiens first entered iberia towards the end of the paleolithic
for a time neanderthals and modern humans coexisted until the former were finally driven to extinction
modern man continued to inhabit the peninsula through the mesolithic and neolithic periods
many of the best preserved prehistoric remains are in the atapuerca region rich with limestone caves that have preserved a million years of human evolution
among these sites is the cave of gran dolina where six hominin skeletons dated between and million years ago were found in
experts have debated whether these skeletons belong to the species homo erectus homo heidelbergensis or a new species called homo antecessor
in the gran dolina investigators have found evidence of tool use to butcher animals and other hominins which is likely to constitute the first evidence of cannibalism in a hominin species
evidence of fire has also been found at the site suggesting they cooked their meat
also in atapuerca is the site at sima de los huesos or pit of bones
excavators have found the remains of hominins dated to about years ago
the remains have been tentatively classified as homo heidelbergensis and may be ancestors of the neanderthals
no evidence of habitation has been found at the site except for one stone hand ax and all of the remains at the site are of young adults or teenagers
the age similarity suggests the remains were not the result of accidents
the seemingly deliberate placement of remains and lack of habitation may mean that the bodies were deliberately interred in the pit as a place of burial which would make the site the first evidence of hominin burial
around bc during the lower paleolithic period neanderthals first entered the iberian peninsula
around bc during the middle paleolithic period the last ice age began and the neanderthal mousterian culture was established
the escoural cave has evidence of human activity starting in the middle palaeolithic with an estimated date of years bp
around bc during the upper paleolithic the neanderthal ch telperronian cultural period began
emanating from southern france this culture extended into northern iberia
this culture continued to exist until around bc when neanderthal man faced extinction their final refuge has been said to be gibraltar
neanderthal remains have been found at a number of sites on the iberian peninsula
a neanderthal skull was found in forbes quarry in gibraltar in making it the second territory after belgium where remains of neanderthals were found
neanderthals were not recognized as a separate species until the discovery of remains in neandertal germany in though their classification as a separate species has recently been called into question
subsequent neanderthal discoveries in gibraltar have also been made including the skull of a four year old child and preserved excrement on top of baked mussel shells
the neanderthals were present in iberia until at least or bc
evidence of their presence in this period is found in columbeira figueira brava and salemas
the cave of salemas and the cave of pego do diabo both located in loures municipality were inhabited in the paleolithic
archaeological industries of the middle paleolithic in iberia lasted until about or bc
during this period the mousterian culture was replaced by the aurignacian culture
the mousterian culture is associated with neanderthals and the aurignacian culture is associated with modern humans
in zafarraya a neanderthal mandible and mousterian tools associated with the neanderthal culture were found in
the mandible was dated to about bc and the tools to about bc
these dates make the zafarraya remains the youngest evidence of neanderthals and have expanded the timeline of neanderthal existence
the more recent dating of the remains also provides the first evidence for prolonged co existence between neanderthals and modern man
l arbreda cave in catalonia contains aurignacian cave paintings as well as earlier remains from neanderthals
some have also suggested that the newer remains in iberia suggest neanderthals were driven out of central europe by modern man to the iberian peninsula where they sought refuge
the chatelperronian culture typically associated with neanderthal man is found in the cantabrian region and in catalonia
the aurignacian culture work of homo sapiens succeeds it and has the following periodization
archaic aurignacian found in cantabria mor n and el pendo caves where it alternates with chatelperronian and in catalonia
the carbon c dates for mor n cave are relatively late in the european context c
bp but the occupation dates for el pendo where it s older than chatelperronian layers must be of earlier date
typical aurignacian is found in cantabria mor n el pendo castillo the basque country santimami e and catalonia
radiocarbon dating gives the following dates and bp
evolved aurignacian is found in cantabria morin el pendo el otero hornos de la pe a asturias el cierro el conde and catalonia
final aurignacian in cantabria el pendo after the gravettian interlude in the mediterranean area south of the ebro aurignacian remains have been found sparsely distributed in the lands of valencia les mallaetes and murcia las pereneras and andalusia higuer n as far west as gibraltar gorham s cave
the c dates available are bp les mallaetes and bp gorham s cave
the remains of a child dated to ca
years bp known as the lapedo child were discovered in lagar velho in leiria municipality
the cranium mandible dentition and postcrania present a mosaic of european early modern human and neanderthal features
it is claimed the individual was a hybrid between a cro magnon and a neanderthal
this claim is contested
ian tattersall and jeffrey h
schwartz consider it is probable the individual was a modern human part of the gravettian culture
the gravettian culture followed the steps of the aurignacian expansion but its remains are not very abundant in the cantabrian area north while in the southern region they are more common
in the cantabrian area all gravettian remains belong to late evolved phases and are found always mixed with aurignacian technology
the main sites are found in the basque country lezetxiki bolinkoba cantabria mor n el pendo el castillo and asturias cueto de la mina
it is archeologically divide in two phases characterized by the amount of gravettian elements the phase a has a c date of c bp and the phase b is of later date
the cantabrian gravettian has been paralleled to the perigordian v vii of the french sequence
it eventually vanishes from the archaeological sequence and is replaced by an aurignacian renaissance at least in el pendo cave
it is considered intrusive in contrast with the mediterranean area where it probably means a real colonization
in the mediterranean region the gravettian culture also had a late arrival
nevertheless the south east has an important number of sites of this culture especially in the land of valencia les mallaetes parpal barranc blanc meravelles coba del sol ratlla del musol beneito
it is also found in the land of murcia palomas palomarico morote and andalusia los borceguillos z jara ii serr n gorham s cave
the first indications of modern human colonization of the interior and the west of the peninsula are found only in this cultural phase with a few late gravettian elements found in the manzanares valley madrid and salemas cave alentejo portugal
the solutrean culture shows its earliest appearances in laugerie haute dordogne france and les mallaetes land of valencia with radiocarbon dates of and bp respectively
in the iberian peninsula it shows three different facies
the iberian or mediterranean facies is defined by the sites of parpall and les mallaetes in the province of valencia
they are found immersed in important gravettian perdurations that would eventually redefine the facies as gravettizing solutrean the archetypical sequence that of parpall and les mallaetes caves is
initial solutrean
full or middle solutrean dated in its lower layers to bp
a sterile layer with signs of intense cold that is related to the last glacial maximum
upper or evolved solutrean including bone tools and also needles of this material these two caves are surrounded by many other sites barranc blanc meravelles rates penaes etc that show only a limited impact of solutrean and instead have many gravettian perdurations showing a convergence that has been named as gravetto solutrean
solutrean is also found in the land of murcia mediterranean andalusia and the lower tagus portugal
in the portuguese case there are no signs of gravettization
the cantabrian facies shows two markedly different tendencies in asturias and the vasco cantabrian area
the oldest findings are all in asturias and lack of the initial phases beginning with the full solutrean in las caldas asturias and other nearby sites followed by evolved solutrean with many unique regional elements
radiocarbon dates oscillate between and bp
in the vasco cantabrian area instead the gravettian influences seem persistent and the typical solutrean foliaceous elements are minority
some transitional elements that prelude the magdalenian like the monobiselated bone spear point are already present
most important sites are altamira mor n chuf n salitre ermittia atxura lezetxiki and santimami e
in northern catalonia there is an early local solutrean followed by scarce middle elements but with a well developed final solutrean
it is related to the french pyrenean sequences
main sites are cau le goges reclau viver and l arbreda
in the region of madrid there were some findings attributed to solutrean that are today missing
this phase is defined by the magdalenian culture even if in the mediterranean area the gravettian influence is still persistent
in the cantabrian area the early magdalenian phases show two different facies the castillo facies evolves locally over final solutrean layers while the rasca o facies appears in most cases directly over the natural soil no earlier occupations of these sites
in the second phase the lower evolved magdalenian there are also two facies but now with a geographical divide the el juyo facies is found in asturias and cantabria while the basque country facies is only found in this region
the dates for this early magdalenian period oscillate between bp for rasca o cave rasca o facies and bp for the same cave el juyo facies and bp for altamira castillo facies
for the basque country facies the cave of abauntz has given bp
the middle magdalenian shows less abundance of findings
the upper magdalenian is closely related to that of southern france magdalenian v and vi being characterized by the presence of harpoons
again there are two facies called a and b that appear geographically intertwined though the facies a dates bp is absent in the basque country and the facies b dates bp is rare in asturias
in portugal there have been some findings of the upper magdalenian north of lisbon casa da moura lapa do su o
a possible intermediate site is la dehesa salamanca spain that is clearly associated with that of the cantabrian area
in the mediterranean area catalonia again is directly connected with the french sequence at least in the late phases
instead the rest of the region shows a unique local evolution known as parpallense
the sometimes called parpall magdalenian extended by all the south east is actually a continuity of the local gravetto solutrean
only the late upper magdalenian actually includes true elements of this culture like proto harpoons
radicarbon dates for this phase are of c
bp borran gran
other sites give later dates that actually approach the epi paleolithic
together with france the iberian peninsula is one of the prime areas of paleolithic cave paintings with caves forming the world heritage site of cave of altamira and paleolithic cave art of northern spain they are close to the coast in cantabria asturias and the basque country
this artistic manifestation is found most importantly in the northern cantabrian area where the earliest manifestations for example the caves of monte castillo are as old as aurignacian times
the practice of this mural art increases in frequency in the solutrean period when the first animals are drawn but it is not until the magdalenian cultural phase when it becomes truly widespread being found in almost every cave
most of the representations are of animals bison horse deer bull reindeer goat bear mammoth moose and are painted in ochre and black colors but there are exceptions and human like forms as well as abstract drawings also appear in some sites
in the mediterranean and interior areas the presence of mural art is not so abundant but exists as well since the solutrean
also several examples of open air art exist
the monumental c a valley in vila nova de foz c a municipality portugal has petroglyphs dating up to years ago
these document continuous human occupation from the end of the paleolithic age
hundreds of panels with thousands of animal figures were carved over several millennia representing the most remarkable open air ensemble of paleolithic art on the iberian peninsula
other examples include chimachias los casares or la pasiega or in general the caves principally in cantabria in spain
around bc an interstadial deglaciation called the aller d oscillation occurred weakening the rigorous conditions of the last ice age
this climatic change also represents the end of the upper palaeolithic period beginning the epipaleolithic
depending on the terminology preferred by any particular source the mesolithic begins after the epipaleolithic or includes it
if the epipaleolithic is not included in it the mesolithic is a relatively brief period in iberia
as the climate became warmer the late magdalenian peoples of iberia modified their technology and culture
the main techno cultural change is the process of microlithization the reduction of size of stone and bone tools also found in other parts of the world
also the cave sanctuaries seem to be abandoned and art becomes rarer and mostly done on portable objects such as pebbles or tools
it also implies changes in diet as the megafauna virtually disappears when the steppe becomes woodlands
in this period hunted animals are of smaller size typically deer or wild goats and seafood becomes an important part of the diet where available
the first epipaleolithic culture is the azilian also known as microlaminar microlithism in the mediterranean
this culture is the local evolution of magdalenian parallel to other regional derivatives found in central and northern europe
originally found in the old magdalenian territory of vasco cantabria and the wider franco cantabrian region azilian style culture eventually expanded to parts of mediterranean iberia as well
it reflected a much warmer climate leading to thick woodlands and the replacement of large herd animals with smaller and more elusive forest dwellers
an archetypical azilian site in the iberian peninsula is zatoya navarre where it is difficult to discern the early azilian elements from those of late magdalenian this transition dated to bp
full azilian in the same site is dated to bp followed by appearance of geometric elements at a later date that continue until the arrival of pottery subneolithic stage
in the mediterranean area virtually this same material culture is often named microlaminar microlithism because it lacks of the bone industry typical of franco cantabrian azilian
it is found in parts of catalonia valencian community murcia and mediterranean andalusia
it has been dated in les mallaetes at bp
the asturian culture was a successor to the azilian moved slightly to the west whose distinctive tool was a pick axe for picking limpets off rocks
in the late phases of the epipaleolithic a new trend arrives from the north the geometrical microlithism directly related to sauveterrian and tardenoisian cultures of the rhine danube region
while in the franco cantabrian region it has a minor impact not altering the azilian culture substantially in mediterranean iberia and portugal its arrival is more noticeable
the mediterranean geometrical microlithism has two facies
the filador facies is directly related to french sauveterrian and is found in catalonia north of the ebro river
the cocina facies is more widespread and in many sites m laga spain shows a strong dependence of fishing and seafood gathering
the portuguese sites south of the tagus muge group have given dates of c the rock art found at over sites along the eastern side of iberia is the most advanced and widespread surviving from this period certainly in europe and arguably in the world
it is strikingly different from the upper palaeolithic art found along the northern coast with narrative scenes with large numbers of small sketchily painted human figures rather than the superbly observed individual animal figures that characterise the earlier period
when it appears in the same scene as animals the human figure runs towards them
the most common scenes by far are of hunting and there are scenes of battle and dancing and possibly agricultural tasks and managing domesticated animals
in some scenes gathering honey is shown most famously at cuevas de la ara a en bicorp illustrated below
humans are naked from the waist up but women have skirts and men sometimes skirts or gaiters or trousers of some sort and headdresses and masks are sometimes seen which may indicate rank or status
in the th millennium bc andalusia experiences the arrival of the first agriculturalists
their origin is uncertain though north africa is a serious candidate but they arrive with already developed crops cereals and legumes
the presence of domestic animals instead is unlikely as only pig and rabbit remains have been found and these could belong to wild animals
they also consumed large amounts of olives but it s uncertain too whether this tree was cultivated or merely harvested in its wild form
their typical artifact is the la almagra style pottery quite variegated
the andalusian neolithic also influenced other areas notably southern portugal where soon after the arrival of agriculture the first dolmen tombs begin to be built c
bc being possibly the oldest of their kind anywhere
bc cardium pottery neolithic culture also known as mediterranean neolithic arrives to eastern iberia
while some remains of this culture have been found as far west as portugal its distribution is basically mediterranean catalonia valencian region ebro valley balearic islands
the interior and the northern coastal areas remain largely marginal in this process of spread of agriculture
in most cases it would only arrive in a very late phase or even already in the chalcolithic age together with megalithism
the location of perdig es in reguengos de monsaraz is thought to have been an important location
twenty small ivory statues dating to years bp have been discovered there since
it has constructions dating back to about years
it has a necropolis
outside the location there is a cromlech
the almendres cromlech site in vora has megaliths from the late th to the early rd millennium bc
the anta grande do zambujeiro also in vora is dated between the early th and the mid rd millennium bc
the dolmen of cunha baixa in mangualde municipality is dated between and bc
the cave of salemas was used as a burial ground during the neolithic
the chalcolithic or copper age is the earliest phase of metallurgy
copper silver and gold started to be worked then though these soft metals could hardly replace stone tools for most purposes
the chalcolithic is also a period of increased social complexity and stratification and in the case of iberia that of the rise of the first civilizations and of extensive exchange networks that would reach to the baltic and africa
the conventional date for the beginning of chalcolithic in iberia is c
in the following centuries especially in the south of the peninsula metal goods often decorative or ritual become increasingly common
additionally there is an increased evidence of exchanges with areas far away amber from the baltic and ivory and ostrich egg products from northern africa
the beaker culture was present in iberia during the chalcolithic
gordon childe interpreted the presence of its characteristic artefact as the intrusion of missionaries expanding from iberia along the atlantic coast spreading knowledge of mediterranean copper metallurgy
stephen shennan interpreted their artefacts as belonging to a mobile cultural elite imposing itself over the indigenous substrate populations
similarly sangmeister interpreted the beaker folk glockenbecherleute as small groups of highly mobile traders and artisans
christian strahm used the term bell beaker phenomenon glockenbecher ph nomen as a compromise in order to avoid the term culture
the bell beaker artefacts at least in their early phase are not distributed across a contiguous areal as is usual for archaeological cultures but are found in insular concentrations scattered across europe
their presence is not associated with a characteristic type of architecture or of burial customs
however the bell beaker culture does appear to coalesce into a coherent archaeological culture in its later phase
more recent analyses of the beaker phenomenon published since the s have persisted in describing the origin of the beaker phenomenon as arising from a synthesis of elements representing an idea and style uniting different regions with different cultural traditions and background
archaeogenetics studies of the s have been able to resolve the migrationist vs
diffusionist question to some extent
the study by olalde et al
found only limited genetic affinity between individuals associated with the beaker complex in iberia and in central europe suggesting that migration played a limited role in its early spread from iberia
however the same study found that the further dissemination of the mature beaker complex was very strongly linked to migration
the spread and fluidity of the beaker culture back and forth between the rhine and its origin source in the peninsula may have introduced high levels of steppe related ancestry resulting in a near complete transformation of the local gene pool within a few centuries to the point of replacement of about of the local mesolithic neolithic patrilineal lineages
the origin of the bell beaker artefact itself has been traced to the early rd millennium
the earliest examples of the maritime bell beaker design have been found at the tagus estuary in portugal radiocarbon dated to c
the th century bc
the inspiration for the maritime bell beaker is argued to have been the small and earlier copoz beakers that have impressed decoration and which are found widely around the tagus estuary in portugal
turek has recorded late neolithic precursors in northern africa arguing the maritime style emerged as a result of seaborne contacts between iberia and morocco in the first half of the third millennium bce
in only a few centuries of their maritime spread by bc
they had reached the rich lower rhine estuary and further upstream into bohemia and beyond the elbe where they merged with corded ware culture as also in the french coast of provence and upstream the rhone into the alps and danube
a significant chalcolithic archeological site in portugal is the castro of vila nova de s o pedro
other settlements from this period include pedra do ouro and the castro of zambujal
megaliths were created during this period having started earlier during the late th and lasting until the early nd millennium bc
the castelo velho de freixo de num o in vila nova de foz c a municipality was populated from about to bc
the cerro do castelo de santa justa in alcoutim is dated to the rd millennium bc between and bc
it is also the period of the great expansion of megalithism with its associated collective burial practices
in the early chalcolithic period this cultural phenomenon maybe of religious undertones expands along the atlantic regions and also through the south of the peninsula additionally it s also found in virtually all european atlantic regions
in contrast most of the interior and the mediterranean regions remain refractary to this phenomenon
another phenomenon found in the early chalcolithic is the development of new types of funerary monuments tholoi and artificial caves
these are only found in the more developed areas southern iberia from the tagus estuary to almer a and se france
eventually c
bc urban communities began to appear again especially in the south
the most important ones are los millares in se spain and zambujal belonging to vila nova de s o pedro culture in portuguese estremadura that can well be called civilizations even if they lack of the literary component
it is very unclear if any cultural influence originated in the eastern mediterranean cyprus could have sparked these civilizations
on one side the tholos does have a precedent in that area even if not used yet as tomb but on the other there is no material evidence of any exchange between the eastern and western mediterranean in contrast with the abundance of goods imported from northern europe and africa
since c
bc the bell beaker culture intrudes in chalcolithic iberia
after the early corded style beaker of quite clear central european origin the peninsula begins producing its own types of bell beaker pottery
most important is the maritime or international style that associated especially with megalithism is for some centuries abundant in all the peninsula and southern france
since c
bc the bell beaker phenomenon in iberia shows a regionalization with different styles being produced in the various regions palmela type in portugal continental type in the plateau and almerian type in los millares among others
like in other parts of europe the bell beaker phenomenon speculated to be of trading or maybe religious nature does not significantly alter the cultures it inserts itself in
instead the cultural contexts that existed previously continue basically unchanged by its presence
the center of bronze age technology is in the southeast since c
there the civilization of los millares was followed by that of el argar initially with no other discontinuity than the displacement of the main urban center some kilometers to the north the gradual appearance of true bronze and arsenical bronze tools and some greater geographical extension
the argarian people lived in rather large fortified towns or cities
from this center bronze technology spread to other areas
most notable are
bronze of levante in the valencian community
their towns were smaller and show intense interaction with their neighbors of el argar
south western iberian bronze in southern portugal and sw spain
these poorly defined archaeological horizons show bronze daggers and an expansive trend northward
cogotas i culture cogotas ii is iron age celtic the pastoral peoples of the plateau become for the first time culturally unified
their typical artifact is a rough troncoconic pottery some areas like the civilization of vila nova seem to have remained apart from the spread of bronze metallurgy remaining technically in the chalcolithic period for centuries
basically a continuation of the previous period
the most noticeable change happens in the el argar civilization which adopts the aegean custom of burial in pithoi
this phase is known as el argar b beginning c
the northwest galicia and northern portugal a region that held some of the largest reserves of tin needed to make true bronze in western eurasia became a focus for mining incorporating bronze technology
their typical artifacts are bronze axes group of montelavar
the semi desert region of la mancha shows its first signs of colonization with the fortified scheme of the motillas hillforts
this group is clearly related to the bronze of levante showing the same material culture
bc several major changes happen in iberia among them
the chalcolithic culture of vila nova vanishes possibly in direct relation to the silting of the canal connecting the main city zambujal with the sea
it is replaced by a non urban culture whose main artifact is an externally burnished pottery
el argar also disappears as such what had been a very homogeneous culture a centralized state for some becomes an array of many post argaric fortified cities
the motillas are abandoned
the proto celtic urnfield culture appears in the north east conquering all catalonia and some neighbouring areas
the lower guadalquivir valley shows its first clearly differentiated culture defined by internally burnished pottery
this group might have some relation with the semi historical yet to be found tartessos
western iberian bronze cultures show some degree of interaction not just among them but also with other atlantic cultures in britain france and elsewhere
this has been called the atlantic bronze complex iron age iberia has two focuses the hallstatt related urnfields of the north east and the phoenician colonies of the south
during the iron age considered the protohistory of the territory celts came in several waves possibly starting before bc
southwest paleohispanic script or tartessian seen in algarve and lower alentejo from about the late th to the th century bc is possibly the oldest script in western europe
it could have come from the eastern mediterranean perhaps from anatolia or greece
since the late th century bc the urnfield culture of north east iberia began to develop iron metallurgy and eventually elements of hallstatt culture
the earliest elements of this culture were found along the lower ebro river then gradually expanded upstream to la rioja and in a hybrid local form to alava
there was also expansion southward into castell with less marked influences reaching further south
some offshoots have been detected along the iberian mountains possibly a prelude to the formation of the celtiberi
in this period the social differentiation became more visible with evidence of local chiefdoms and a horse riding elite
these transformations may represent the arrival of a new wave of cultures from central europe
from these outposts in the upper ebro and the iberian mountains celtic culture expanded into the plateau and the atlantic coast
several groups can be described
the bernorio miraveche group northern burgos and palencia provinces that would influence the peoples of the northern fringe
the northwest castro culture in galicia and northern portugal a celtic culture with peculiarities due to persistence of aspects of an earlier atlantic bronze age culture
the duero group possibly the precursor of the celtic vaccei
the cogotas ii culture likely precursor of the celtic or celtiberian vettones or a pre celtic culture with substantial celtic influences a markedly cattle herder culture that gradually expanded southward into extremadura
the lusitanian culture the precursor of the lusitani tribe in central portugal and extremadura in western spain
generally not considered celtic since lusitanian does not meet some the accepted definitions of a celtic language
its relationship with the surrounding celtic culture is unclear
some believe it was essentially a pre celtic iberian culture with substantial celtic influences while others argue that it was an essentially celtic culture with strong indigenous pre celtic influences
there have been arguments for classifying its language as either italic a form of archaic celtic or proto celtic all these indo european groups have some common elements like combed pottery since the th century and uniform weaponry
after c
bc the urnfields of the north east were replaced by the iberian culture a process that wasn t completed until the th century bc
this physical separation from their continental relatives would mean that the celts of the iberian peninsula never received the cultural influences of la t ne culture including druidism
the phoenicians of the levant greeks of europe and carthaginians of africa all colonized parts of iberia to facilitate trade
in the th century bc the first contacts between phoenicians and iberia along the mediterranean coast were made
this century also saw the emergence of towns and cities in the southern littoral areas of eastern iberia
the phoenicians founded colony of gadir now c diz near tartessos
the foundation of c diz the oldest continuously inhabited city in western europe is traditionally dated to bc though as of no archaeological discoveries date back further than the th century bc
the phoenicians continued to use c diz as a trading post for several centuries leaving a variety of artifacts most notably a pair of sarcophaguses from around the th or rd century bc
contrary to myth there is no record of phoenician colonies west of algarve namely tavira though there might have been some voyages of discovery
phoenician influence in what is now portugal was essentially through cultural and commercial exchange with tartessos
in the th century bc the phoenicians from the city state of tyre founded the colony of malaka now m laga and carthage in north africa
during this century phoenicians also had great influence on iberia with the introduction the use of iron of the potter s wheel the production of olive oil and wine
they were also responsible for the first forms of iberian writing had great religious influence and accelerated urban development
however there is no real evidence to support the myth of a phoenician foundation of the city of lisbon as far back as bc under the name alis ubbo safe harbour even if in this period there are organized settlements in olissipona modern lisbon in portuguese estremadura with mediterranean influences
there was strong phoenician influence and settlement in the city of balsa modern tavira algarve in the th century bc
phoenician influenced tavira was destroyed by violence in the th century bc
with the decadence of phoenician colonization of the mediterranean coast of iberia in the th century bc many of the colonies are deserted
the th century bc also saw the rise of the colonial might of carthage which slowly replaced the phoenicians in their former areas of dominion
the greek colony at what now is marseilles began trading with the iberians on the eastern coast around the th century bc
the greeks finally founded their own colony at ampurias in the eastern mediterranean shore modern catalonia during the th century bc beginning their settlement in the iberian peninsula
there are no greek colonies west of the strait of gibraltar only voyages of discovery
there is no evidence to support the myth of an ancient greek founding of olissipo modern lisbon by odysseus
the name tartessian when applied in archaeology and linguistics does not necessarily correlate with the semi mythical city of tartessos but only roughly with the area where it is typically assumed it should have been
the tartessian culture of southern iberia is actually the local culture as modified by the increasing influence of eastern mediterranean elements especially phoenician
its core area is western andalusia but soon extends to eastern andalusia extremadura and the lands of murcia and valencia where a tartessian complex rooted in the local bronze cultures is in the last stages of the bronze age th th centuries bc before phoenician influence can be seen clearly
the full tartessian culture beginning c bc also extends to southern portugal where is eventually replaced by lusitanian culture
one of the most significant elements of this culture is the introduction of the potter s wheel that along with other related technical developments causes a major improvement in quality of pottery
there are other major advances in craftsmanship affecting jewelry weaving and architecture
this latter aspects is especially important as the traditional circular huts were then gradually replaced by well finished rectangular buildings
it also allowed for the construction of the tower like burial monuments that are so typical of this culture
agriculture also seems to have experienced major advances with the introduction of steel tools and presumably of the yoke and animal traction for the plow
in this period it s noticeable the increase of cattle accompanied by some decrease of sheep and goat types
another noticeable element is the major increase in economical specialization and social stratification
this is very noticeable in burials some show off great wealth chariots gold ivory while the vast majority are much more modest
there is much diversity in burial rituals in this period but the elites seem to converge in one single style a chambered mound
some of the most affluent burials are generally attributed to local monarchs
one of the developments of this period is writing a skill which was probably acquired through contact with the phoenicians
john t
koch controversially claimed to have deciphered the extant tartessian inscriptions and to have tentatively identified the language as an earlier form of the celtic languages now spoken in the british isles and brittany in the book celtic from the west published in
however the linguistic mainstream continues to treat tartessian as an unclassified possibly pre indo european language and koch s decipherment of the tartessian script and his theory for the evolution of celtic has been strongly criticized
in the iberian culture people were organized in chiefdoms and states
three phases can be identified the ancient the middle and the late iberian period
with the arrival of greek influence not limited to their few colonies the tartessian culture begins to transform itself especially in the south east
this late period is known as the iberian culture that in western andalusia and the non celtic areas of extremadura is called ibero turdetanian because of its stronger links with the tartessian substrate
greek influence is visible in the gradual change of the style of their monuments that approach more and more the models arrived from the greek world
thus the obelisk like funerary monuments of the previous period now adopt a column like form totally in line with greek architecture
by mid th century aristocratic power was increased and resulted in the abandonment and transformation of the orientalizing model
the oppidum appeared and became the socio economic model of the aristocratic class
the commerce was also one of the principal sources of aristocratic control and power
in the southeast between the end of the th and the end of the th century bc appeared a highly hierarchical aristocratic society
there were different forms of political control
the power and control seemed to be in the hand of kings or reguli
iberian funerary customs are dominated by cremation necropolis that are partly due to the persistent influences of the urnfield culture but they also include burial customs imported from the greek cultural area mudbrick rectangular mound
urbanism was important in the iberian cultural area especially in the south where roman accounts mention hundreds of oppida fortified towns
in these towns some quite large some mere fortified villages the houses were typically arranged in contiguous blocks in what seems to be another urnfield cultural influx
the iberian script evolved from the tartessian one with greek influences that are noticeable in the transformation of some characters
in a few cases a variant of greek alphabet ibero ionian script was used to write iberian as well
the transformation from tartessian to iberian culture was not sudden but gradual and was more marked in the east where it begins in the th century bc than in the south west where it is only noticeable since the th century bc and much more tenuous
a special case is the northeast where the urnfield culture was iberized but keeping some elements from the indo european substrate
also in the th century bc there was a cultural shift in southwest iberia southern portugal and nearby parts of andalusia after tartessos fell with a strong mediterranean character that prolonged and modified tartessian culture
this occurred mainly in low alentejo and algarve but had littoral extensions up to the sado mouth namely the important city of bevipo modern alc cer do sal
the first form of writing in western iberia south of portugal the southwest paleohispanic script still to be translated dated to the th century bc denotes strong tartessian influence in its use of a modified phoenician alphabet
in these writings the word conii similar to cunetes or cynetes the people of algarve appears frequently
in the th century bc the celtici appear a late expansion of celtic culture into the southwest southern extremadura alentejo and northern algarve
the turduli and turdetani probably descendants of the tartessians though celticized became established in the area of the guadiana river in southern portugal
a series of cities in algarve such as balsa tavira baesuris castro marim ossonoba faro and cilpes silves became inhabited by the cynetes
in the th century bc rome began to rise as a mediterranean power rival to the north african based carthage
after suffering defeat to the romans in the first punic war bc the carthaginians began to extend their power into the interior of iberia from their south eastern coastal settlements but this empire was to be short lived
in the second punic war bc the carthaginian general hannibal marched his armies which included iberians from iberia across the pyrenees and the alps and attacked the romans in italy
despite many victories he was finally defeated and the romans took revenge by destroying carthage
starting in the north east rome began its conquest of the iberian peninsula
recently the dna of persons from neolithic and chalcolithic iberia has been analyzed
as for y dna most iberians from this period have been found to be carriers of i a and subclades of it
r b g and h also occurs
