colonialism is a practice or policy of control by one people or power over other people or areas often by establishing colonies and generally with the aim of economic dominance
in the process of colonisation colonisers may impose their religion language economics and other cultural practices
the foreign administrators rule the territory in pursuit of their interests seeking to benefit from the colonised region s people and resources
it is associated with but distinct from imperialism
though colonialism has existed since ancient times the concept is most strongly associated with the european colonial period starting with the th century when some european states established colonising empires
at first european colonising countries followed policies of mercantilism aiming to strengthen the home country economy so agreements usually restricted the colony to trading only with the metropole mother country
by the mid th century however the british empire gave up mercantilism and trade restrictions and adopted the principle of free trade with few restrictions or tariffs
christian missionaries were active in practically all of the european controlled colonies because the metropoles were christian
historian philip hoffman calculated that by before the industrial revolution europeans already controlled at least of the globe and by they had gained control of of the globe
in the aftermath of world war ii colonial powers retreated between and over which time nearly all colonies gained independence entering into changed colonial so called postcolonial and neocolonialist relations
postcolonialism and neocolonialism have continued or shifted relations and ideologies of colonialism justifying its continuation with concepts such as development and new frontiers as in exploring outer space for colonization
collins english dictionary defines colonialism as the practice by which a powerful country directly controls less powerful countries and uses their resources to increase its own power and wealth
webster s encyclopedic dictionary defines colonialism as the system or policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories
the merriam webster dictionary offers four definitions including something characteristic of a colony and control by one power over a dependent area or people
etymologically the word colony comes from the latin col nia a place for agriculture
the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy uses the term to describe the process of european settlement and political control over the rest of the world including the americas australia and parts of africa and asia
it discusses the distinction between colonialism imperialism and conquest and states that t he difficulty of defining colonialism stems from the fact that the term is often used as a synonym for imperialism
both colonialism and imperialism were forms of conquest that were expected to benefit europe economically and strategically and continues given the difficulty of consistently distinguishing between the two terms this entry will use colonialism broadly to refer to the project of european political domination from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries that ended with the national liberation movements of the s
in his preface to j rgen osterhammel s colonialism a theoretical overview roger tignor says for osterhammel the essence of colonialism is the existence of colonies which are by definition governed differently from other territories such as protectorates or informal spheres of influence in the book osterhammel asks how can colonialism be defined independently from colony he settles on a three sentence definition
the times once quipped that there were three types of colonial empire the english which consists in making colonies with colonists the german which collects colonists without colonies the french which sets up colonies without colonists modern studies of colonialism have often distinguished between various overlapping categories of colonialism broadly classified into four types settler colonialism exploitation colonialism surrogate colonialism and internal colonialism
some historians have identified other forms of colonialism including national and trade forms
settler colonialism involves large scale immigration by settlers to colonies often motivated by religious political or economic reasons
this form of colonialism aims largely to supplant prior existing populations with a settler one and involves large number of settlers emigrating to colonies for the purpose of settling down and establishing settlements
australia canada the united states south africa and to a more controversial extent israel are examples of nations created in their modern form by settler colonization
exploitation colonialism involves fewer colonists and focuses on the exploitation of natural resources or labour to the benefit of the metropole
this form consists of trading posts as well as larger colonies where colonists would constitute much of the political and economic administration
the european colonization of africa and asia was largely conducted under the auspices of exploitation colonialism
surrogate colonialism involves a settlement project supported by a colonial power in which most of the settlers do not come from the same ethnic group as the ruling power
internal colonialism is a notion of uneven structural power between areas of a state
the source of exploitation comes from within the state
this is demonstrated in the way control and exploitation may pass from people from the colonizing country to an immigrant population within a newly independent country
national colonialism is a process involving elements of both settler and internal colonialism in which nation building and colonization are symbiotically connected with the colonial regime seeking to remake the colonized peoples into their own cultural and political image
the goal is to integrate them into the state but only as reflections of the state s preferred culture
the republic of china in taiwan is the archetypal example of a national colonialist society
trade colonialism involves the undertaking of colonialist ventures in support of trade opportunities for merchants
this form of colonialism was most prominent in th century asia where previously isolationist states were forced to open their ports to western powers
examples of this include the opium wars and the opening of japan as colonialism often played out in pre populated areas sociocultural evolution included the formation of various ethnically hybrid populations
colonialism gave rise to culturally and ethnically mixed populations such as the mestizos of the americas as well as racially divided populations such as those found in french algeria or in southern rhodesia
in fact everywhere where colonial powers established a consistent and continued presence hybrid communities existed
notable examples in asia include the anglo burmese anglo indian burgher eurasian singaporean filipino mestizo kristang and macanese peoples
in the dutch east indies later indonesia the vast majority of dutch settlers were in fact eurasians known as indo europeans formally belonging to the european legal class in the colony see also indos in pre colonial history and indos in colonial history
activity that could be called colonialism has a long history starting at least as early as the ancient egyptians
phoenicians greeks and romans founded colonies in antiquity
phoenicia had an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across the mediterranean from bc to bc later the persian empire and various greek city states continued on this line of setting up colonies
the romans would soon follow setting up coloniae throughout the mediterranean in northern africa and in western asia
beginning in the th century arabs colonized a substantial portion of the middle east northern africa and parts of asia and europe
from the th century vikings norsemen established colonies in britain ireland iceland greenland north america present day russia and ukraine france normandy and sicily
in the th century a new wave of mediterranean colonisation began with competitors such as the venetians genovese and amalfians infiltrating the wealthy previously byzantine or eastern roman islands and lands
european crusaders set up colonial regimes in outremer in the levant and in the baltic littoral th century onwards
venice began to dominate dalmatia and reached its greatest nominal colonial extent at the conclusion of the fourth crusade in with the declaration of the acquisition of three octaves of the byzantine empire
more than a century before the jamestown virginia settlement led by captain christopher newport modern colonialism started with the portuguese prince henry the navigator initiating the age of exploration and establishing african trading posts onwards
spain initially the crown of castile and soon after portugal encountered the americas onwards through sea travel and built trading posts or conquered large extents of land
for some people it is this building of colonies across oceans that differentiates colonialism from other types of expansionism
madrid and lisbon divided the areas of these new lands between the spanish empire and the portuguese empire in other would be colonial powers paid little heed to the theoretical demarcation
the th century saw the birth of the french colonial empire and the dutch empire as well as the english overseas possessions which later became the british empire
it also saw the establishment of a danish colonial empire and some swedish overseas colonies
a first wave of independence movements started with the american revolutionary war initiating a new phase for the british empire
the spanish empire largely collapsed in the americas with the latin american wars of independence c onwards
however empire builders established several new colonies after this time including in the german colonial empire and the belgian colonial empire
in the late th century many european powers became involved in the scramble for africa
the russian empire ottoman empire and austrian empire existed at the same time as the above empires but did not expand over oceans
rather these empires expanded through the more traditional route of the conquest of neighbouring territories
there was though some russian colonisation of the americas across the bering strait
from the s the empire of japan modelled itself on european colonial empires and expanded its territories in the pacific and on the asian mainland
argentina and the empire of brazil fought for hegemony in south america
the united states of america gained overseas territories after the spanish american war hence the coining of the term american empire
after the first world war of the victorious allies divided up the german colonial empire and much of the ottoman empire between themselves as league of nations mandates grouping these territories into three classes according to how quickly it was deemed that they could prepare for independence
the empires of russia and austria collapsed in
nazi germany set up short lived colonial systems reichskommissariate generalgouvernement in eastern europe in the early s
after world war ii decolonisation progressed rapidly due to a number of reasons
first the japanese victories in the pacific war of had showed indians and other subject peoples that the colonial powers were not invincible
second world war ii had significantly weakened all the overseas colonial powers economically
dozens of independence movements and global political solidarity projects such as the non aligned movement proved instrumental in the decolonisation efforts of former colonies
these included significant wars of independence fought in indonesia vietnam algeria and kenya
eventually the european powers pressured by the united states and soviets resigned themselves to decolonisation
in the united nations set up a special committee on decolonization often called the committee of to encourage this process
the world s colonial population at the outbreak of the first world war a high point for colonialism totalled about million people of whom lived in british possessions in french possessions in dutch possessions in japanese possessions in german possessions in american possessions in portuguese possessions in belgian possessions and in italian possessions
the domestic domains of the colonial powers had a total population of about million people
outside europe few areas had remained without coming under formal colonial tutorship and even siam china nepal japan afghanistan persia and abyssinia had felt varying degrees of western colonial style influence concessions unequal treaties extraterritoriality and the like
asking whether colonies paid economic historian grover clark argues an emphatic no he reports that in every case the support cost especially the military system necessary to support and defend colonies outran the total trade they produced
apart from the british empire they did not provide favoured destinations for the immigration of surplus metropole populations
the question of whether colonies paid is however a complicated one when recognizing the multiplicity of interests involved
in some cases colonial powers paid a lot in military costs while private investors pocketed the benefits
in other cases the colonial powers managed to move the burden of administrative costs to the colonies themselves by imposing taxes
the word neocolonialism has originated from jean paul sartre in to refer to a variety of contexts since the decolonisation that took place after world war ii
generally it does not refer to a type of direct colonisation rather to colonialism or colonial style exploitation by other means
specifically neocolonialism may refer to the theory that former or existing economic relationships such as the general agreement on tariffs and trade and the central american free trade agreement or the operations of companies such as royal dutch shell in nigeria and brunei fostered by former colonial powers were or are used to maintain control of former colonies and dependencies after the colonial independence movements of the post world war ii period
the term neocolonialism became popular in ex colonies in the late th century

various effects both immediate and protracted include the spread of virulent diseases unequal social relations detribalization exploitation enslavement medical advances the creation of new institutions abolitionism improved infrastructure and technological progress
colonial practices also spur the spread of colonist languages literature and cultural institutions while endangering or obliterating those of native peoples
the native cultures of the colonised peoples can also have a powerful influence on the imperial country
economic expansion sometimes described as the colonial surplus has accompanied imperial expansion since ancient times
greek trade networks spread throughout the mediterranean region while roman trade expanded with the primary goal of directing tribute from the colonised areas towards the roman metropole
according to strabo by the time of emperor augustus up to roman ships would set sail every year from myos hormos in roman egypt to india
with the development of trade routes under the ottoman empire
aztec civilisation developed into an extensive empire that much like the roman empire had the goal of exacting tribute from the conquered colonial areas
for the aztecs a significant tribute was the acquisition of sacrificial victims for their religious rituals
on the other hand european colonial empires sometimes attempted to channel restrict and impede trade involving their colonies funneling activity through the metropole and taxing accordingly
despite the general trend of economic expansion the economic performance of former european colonies varies significantly
in institutions as a fundamental cause of long run growth economists daron acemoglu simon johnson and james a
robinson compare the economic influences of the european colonists on different colonies and study what could explain the huge discrepancies in previous european colonies for example between west african colonies like sierra leone and hong kong and singapore
according to the paper economic institutions are the determinant of the colonial success because they determine their financial performance and order for the distribution of resources
at the same time these institutions are also consequences of political institutions especially how de facto and de jure political power is allocated
to explain the different colonial cases we thus need to look first into the political institutions that shaped the economic institutions
for example one interesting observation is the reversal of fortune the less developed civilisations in like north america australia and new zealand are now much richer than those countries who used to be in the prosperous civilisations in before the colonists came like the mughals in india and the incas in the americas
one explanation offered by the paper focuses on the political institutions of the various colonies it was less likely for european colonists to introduce economic institutions where they could benefit quickly from the extraction of resources in the area
therefore given a more developed civilisation and denser population european colonists would rather keep the existing economic systems than introduce an entirely new system while in places with little to extract european colonists would rather establish new economic institutions to protect their interests
political institutions thus gave rise to different types of economic systems which determined the colonial economic performance
european colonisation and development also changed gendered systems of power already in place around the world
in many pre colonialist areas women maintained power prestige or authority through reproductive or agricultural control
for example in certain parts of sub saharan africa women maintained farmland in which they had usage rights
while men would make political and communal decisions for a community the women would control the village s food supply or their individual family s land
this allowed women to achieve power and autonomy even in patrilineal and patriarchal societies
through the rise of european colonialism came a large push for development and industrialisation of most economic systems
however when working to improve productivity europeans focused mostly on male workers
foreign aid arrived in the form of loans land credit and tools to speed up development but were only allocated to men
in a more european fashion women were expected to serve on a more domestic level
the result was a technologic economic and class based gender gap that widened over time
within a colony the presence of extractive colonial institutions in a given area has been found have effects on the modern day economic development institutions and infrastructure of these areas
european nations entered their imperial projects with the goal of enriching the european metropoles
exploitation of non europeans and of other europeans to support imperial goals was acceptable to the colonisers
two outgrowths of this imperial agenda were the extension of slavery and indentured servitude
in the th century nearly two thirds of english settlers came to north america as indentured servants
european slave traders brought large numbers of african slaves to the americas by sail
spain and portugal had brought african slaves to work in african colonies such as cape verde and s o tom and pr ncipe and then in latin america by the th century
the british french and dutch joined in the slave trade in subsequent centuries
the european colonial system took approximately million africans to the caribbean and to north and south america as slaves
abolitionists in europe and americas protested the inhumane treatment of african slaves which led to the elimination of the slave trade and later of most forms of slavery by the late th century
one disputed school of thought points to the role of abolitionism in the american revolution while the british colonial metropole started to move towards outlawing slavery slave owning elites in the thirteen colonies saw this as one of the reasons to fight for their post colonial independence and for the right to develop and continue a largely slave based economy
british colonising activity in new zealand from the early th century played a part in ending slave taking and slave keeping among the indigenous m ori
on the other hand british colonial administration in southern africa when it officially abolished slavery in the s caused rifts in society which arguably perpetuated slavery in the boer republics and fed into the philosophy of apartheid
the labour shortages that resulted from abolition inspired european colonisers in queensland british guaiana and fiji for example to develop new sources of labour re adopting a system of indentured servitude
indentured servants consented to a contract with the european colonisers
under their contract the servant would work for an employer for a term of at least a year while the employer agreed to pay for the servant s voyage to the colony possibly pay for the return to the country of origin and pay the employee a wage as well
the employees became indentured to the employer because they owed a debt back to the employer for their travel expense to the colony which they were expected to pay through their wages
in practice indentured servants were exploited through terrible working conditions and burdensome debts imposed by the employers with whom the servants had no means of negotiating the debt once they arrived in the colony
india and china were the largest source of indentured servants during the colonial era
indentured servants from india travelled to british colonies in asia africa and the caribbean and also to french and portuguese colonies while chinese servants travelled to british and dutch colonies
between and around million indentured servants migrated from india and million returned to india
china sent more indentured servants to european colonies and around the same proportion returned to china
following the scramble for africa an early but secondary focus for most colonial regimes was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade
by the end of the colonial period they were mostly successful in this aim though slavery persists in africa and in the world at large with much the same practices of de facto servility despite legislative prohibition
conquering forces have throughout history applied innovation in order to gain an advantage over the armies of the people they aim to conquer
greeks developed the phalanx system which enabled their military units to present themselves to their enemies as a wall with foot soldiers using shields to cover one another during their advance on the battlefield
under philip ii of macedon they were able to organise thousands of soldiers into a formidable battle force bringing together carefully trained infantry and cavalry regiments
alexander the great exploited this military foundation further during his conquests
the spanish empire held a major advantage over mesoamerican warriors through the use of weapons made of stronger metal predominantly iron which was able to shatter the blades of axes used by the aztec civilisation and others
the use of gunpowder weapons cemented the european military advantage over the peoples they sought to subjugate in the americas and elsewhere
the populations of some colonial territories such as canada enjoyed relative peace and prosperity as part of a european power at least among the majority however minority populations such as first nations peoples and french canadians experienced marginalisation and resented colonial practices
francophone residents of quebec for example were vocal in opposing conscription into the armed services to fight on behalf of britain during world war i resulting in the conscription crisis of
other european colonies had much more pronounced conflict between european settlers and the local population
rebellions broke out in the later decades of the imperial era such as india s sepoy rebellion of
the territorial boundaries imposed by european colonisers notably in central africa and south asia defied the existing boundaries of native populations that had previously interacted little with one another
european colonisers disregarded native political and cultural animosities imposing peace upon people under their military control
native populations were often relocated at the will of the colonial administrators
the partition of british india in august led to the independence of india and the creation of pakistan
these events also caused much bloodshed at the time of the migration of immigrants from the two countries
muslims from india and hindus and sikhs from pakistan migrated to the respective countries they sought independence for
in a reversal of the migration patterns experienced during the modern colonial era post independence era migration followed a route back towards the imperial country
in some cases this was a movement of settlers of european origin returning to the land of their birth or to an ancestral birthplace
french colonists known as the pied noirs resettled in france following algeria s independence in
a significant number of these migrants were also of algerian descent
people of portuguese origin migrated to portugal after the independence of former colonies in africa between and settlers of dutch origin migrated to the netherlands from the dutch west indies after dutch military control of the colony ended
after wwii dutchmen from the dutch east indies of which the majority were people of eurasian descent called indo europeans repatriated to the netherlands
a significant number later migrated to the us canada australia and new zealand
global travel and migration in general developed at an increasingly brisk pace throughout the era of european colonial expansion
citizens of the former colonies of european countries may have a privileged status in some respects with regard to immigration rights when settling in the former european imperial nation
for example rights to dual citizenship may be generous or larger immigrant quotas may be extended to former colonies
in some cases the former european imperial nations continue to foster close political and economic ties with former colonies
the commonwealth of nations is an organisation that promotes cooperation between and among britain and its former colonies the commonwealth members
a similar organisation exists for former colonies of france the francophonie the community of portuguese language countries plays a similar role for former portuguese colonies and the dutch language union is the equivalent for former colonies of the netherlands
migration from former colonies has proven to be problematic for european countries where the majority population may express hostility to ethnic minorities who have immigrated from former colonies
cultural and religious conflict have often erupted in france in recent decades between immigrants from the maghreb countries of north africa and the majority population of france
nonetheless immigration has changed the ethnic composition of france by the s of the total population of inner paris and of the metropolitan region were of foreign origin mainly algerian
encounters between explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced new diseases which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence
for example smallpox measles malaria yellow fever and others were unknown in pre columbian america
half the native population of hispaniola in was killed by smallpox
smallpox also ravaged mexico in the s killing in tenochtitlan alone including the emperor and peru in the s aiding the european conquerors
measles killed a further two million mexican natives in the th century
in smallpox wiped out of the massachusetts bay native americans
smallpox epidemics in and brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the plains indians
some believe that the death of up to of the native american population of the new world was caused by old world diseases
over the centuries the europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases while the indigenous peoples had no time to build such immunity
smallpox decimated the native population of australia killing around of indigenous australians in the early years of british colonisation
it also killed many new zealand m ori
as late as as many as out of hawaiians are estimated to have died of measles whooping cough and influenza
introduced diseases notably smallpox nearly wiped out the native population of easter island
in measles killed over fijians approximately one third of the population
the ainu population decreased drastically in the th century due in large part
to infectious diseases brought by japanese settlers pouring into hokkaido
conversely researchers have hypothesised that a precursor to syphilis may have been carried from the new world to europe after columbus s voyages
the findings suggested europeans could have carried the nonvenereal tropical bacteria home where the organisms may have mutated into a more deadly form in the different conditions of europe
the disease was more frequently fatal than it is today syphilis was a major killer in europe during the renaissance
the first cholera pandemic began in bengal then spread across india by
ten thousand british troops and countless indians died during this pandemic
between and only some of east india company s officers survived to take the final voyage home
waldemar haffkine who mainly worked in india who developed and used vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague in the s is considered the first microbiologist
according to a study by j rg baten and laura maravall on the anthropometric influence of colonialism on africans the average height of africans decreased by centimetres upon colonization and later recovered and increased overall during colonial rule
the authors attributed the decrease to diseases such as malaria and sleeping sickness forced labor during the early decades of colonial rule conflicts land grabbing and widespread cattle deaths from the rinderpest viral disease
as early as the spanish crown organised a mission the balmis expedition to transport the smallpox vaccine to the spanish colonies and establish mass vaccination programs there
by the federal government of the united states established a smallpox vaccination program for native americans
under the direction of mountstuart elphinstone a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination in india
from the beginning of the th century onwards the elimination or control of disease in tropical countries became a driving force for all colonial powers
the sleeping sickness epidemic in africa was arrested due to mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk
in the th century the world saw the biggest increase in its population in human history due to lessening of the mortality rate in many countries due to medical advances
the world population has grown from billion in to over seven billion today
colonial botany refers to the body of works concerning the study cultivation marketing and naming of the new plants that were acquired or traded during the age of european colonialism
notable examples of these plants included sugar nutmeg tobacco cloves cinnamon peruvian bark peppers and tea
this work was a large part of securing financing for colonial ambitions supporting european expansion and ensuring the profitability of such endeavors
vasco de gama and christopher columbus were seeking to establish routes to trade spices dyes and silk from the moluccas india and china by sea that would be independent of the established routes controlled by venetian and middle eastern merchants
naturalists like hendrik van rheede georg eberhard rumphius and jacobus bontius compiled data about eastern plants on behalf of the europeans
though sweden did not possess an extensive colonial network botanical research based on carl linnaeus identified and developed techniques to grow cinnamon tea and rice locally as an alternative to costly imports
the conquest of vast territories brings multitudes of diverse cultures under the central control of the imperial authorities
from the time of ancient greece and ancient rome this fact has been addressed by empires adopting the concept of universalism and applying it to their imperial policies towards their subjects far from the imperial capitol
the capitol the metropole was the source of ostensibly enlightened policies imposed throughout the distant colonies
the empire that grew from greek conquest particularly by alexander the great spurred the spread of greek language religion science and philosophy throughout the colonies
while most greeks considered their own culture superior to all others the word barbarian is derived from mutterings that sounded to greek ears like bar bar alexander was unique in promoting a campaign to win the hearts and minds of the persians
he adopted persian customs of clothing and otherwise encouraged his men to go native by adopting local wives and learning their mannerisms
of note is that he radically departed from earlier greek attempts at colonisation characterised by the murder and enslavement of the local inhabitants and the settling of greek citizens from the polis
roman universalism was characterised by cultural and religious tolerance and a focus on civil efficiency and the rule of law
roman law was imposed on both roman citizens and colonial subjects
although imperial rome had no public education latin spread through its use in government and trade
roman law prohibited local leaders to wage war between themselves which was responsible for the year long pax romana at the time the longest period of peace in history
the roman empire was tolerant of diverse cultures and religious practises even allowing them on a few occasions to threaten roman authority
settlers acted as the link between indigenous populations and the imperial hegemony thus bridging the geographical ideological and commercial gap between the colonisers and colonised
while the extent in which geography as an academic study is implicated in colonialism is contentious geographical tools such as cartography shipbuilding navigation mining and agricultural productivity were instrumental in european colonial expansion
colonisers awareness of the earth s surface and abundance of practical skills provided colonisers with a knowledge that in turn created power
anne godlewska and neil smith argue that empire was quintessentially a geographical project
historical geographical theories such as environmental determinism legitimised colonialism by positing the view that some parts of the world were underdeveloped which created notions of skewed evolution
geographers such as ellen churchill semple and ellsworth huntington put forward the notion that northern climates bred vigour and intelligence as opposed to those indigenous to tropical climates see the tropics viz a viz a combination of environmental determinism and social darwinism in their approach
political geographers also maintain that colonial behaviour was reinforced by the physical mapping of the world therefore creating a visual separation between them and us
geographers are primarily focused on the spaces of colonialism and imperialism more specifically the material and symbolic appropriation of space enabling colonialism
maps played an extensive role in colonialism as bassett would put it by providing geographical information in a convenient and standardised format cartographers helped open west africa to european conquest commerce and colonisation
however because the relationship between colonialism and geography was not scientifically objective cartography was often manipulated during the colonial era
social norms and values had an effect on the constructing of maps
during colonialism map makers used rhetoric in their formation of boundaries and in their art
the rhetoric favoured the view of the conquering europeans this is evident in the fact that any map created by a non european was instantly regarded as inaccurate
furthermore european cartographers were required to follow a set of rules which led to ethnocentrism portraying one s own ethnicity in the centre of the map
as j b
harley put it the steps in making a map selection omission simplification classification the creation of hierarchies and symbolisation are all inherently rhetorical
a common practice by the european cartographers of the time was to map unexplored areas as blank spaces
this influenced the colonial powers as it sparked competition amongst them to explore and colonise these regions
imperialists aggressively and passionately looked forward to filling these spaces for the glory of their respective countries
the dictionary of human geography notes that cartography was used to empty undiscovered lands of their indigenous meaning and bring them into spatial existence via the imposition of western place names and borders therefore priming virgin putatively empty land wilderness for colonisation thus sexualising colonial landscapes as domains of male penetration reconfiguring alien space as absolute quantifiable and separable as property
david livingstone stresses that geography has meant different things at different times and in different places and that we should keep an open mind in regards to the relationship between geography and colonialism instead of identifying boundaries
geography as a discipline was not and is not an objective science painter and jeffrey argue rather it is based on assumptions about the physical world
comparison of exogeographical representations of ostensibly tropical environments in science fiction art support this conjecture finding the notion of the tropics to be an artificial collection of ideas and beliefs that are independent of geography
a colony is a part of an empire and so colonialism is closely related to imperialism
assumptions are that colonialism and imperialism are interchangeable however robert j
young suggests that imperialism is the concept while colonialism is the practice
colonialism is based on an imperial outlook thereby creating a consequential relationship
through an empire colonialism is established and capitalism is expanded on the other hand a capitalist economy naturally enforces an empire
marxism views colonialism as a form of capitalism enforcing exploitation and social change
marx thought that working within the global capitalist system colonialism is closely associated with uneven development
it is an instrument of wholesale destruction dependency and systematic exploitation producing distorted economies socio psychological disorientation massive poverty and neocolonial dependency
colonies are constructed into modes of production
the search for raw materials and the current search for new investment opportunities is a result of inter capitalist rivalry for capital accumulation
lenin regarded colonialism as the root cause of imperialism as imperialism was distinguished by monopoly capitalism via colonialism and as lyal s
sunga explains vladimir lenin advocated forcefully the principle of self determination of peoples in his theses on the socialist revolution and the right of nations to self determination as an integral plank in the programme of socialist internationalism and he quotes lenin who contended that the right of nations to self determination implies exclusively the right to independence in the political sense the right to free political separation from the oppressor nation
specifically this demand for political democracy implies complete freedom to agitate for secession and for a referendum on secession by the seceding nation non russian marxists within the rsfsr and later the ussr like sultan galiev and vasyl shakhrai meanwhile between and and then after considered the soviet regime a renewed version of the russian imperialism and colonialism
in his critique of colonialism in africa the guyanese historian and political activist walter rodney states
the decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for africa spring mainly from the fact that africa lost power
power is the ultimate determinant in human society being basic to the relations within any group and between groups
it implies the ability to defend one s interests and if necessary to impose one s will by any means available
when one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society that in itself is a form of underdevelopment
during the centuries of pre colonial trade some control over social political and economic life was retained in africa in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with europeans
that little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism
colonialism went much further than trade
it meant a tendency towards direct appropriation by europeans of the social institutions within africa
africans ceased to set indigenous cultural goals and standards and lost full command of training young members of the society
those were undoubtedly major steps backwards
colonialism was not merely a system of exploitation but one whose essential purpose was to repatriate the profits to the so called mother country
from an african view point that amounted to consistent expatriation of surplus produced by african labour out of african resources
it meant the development of europe as part of the same dialectical process in which africa was underdeveloped
colonial africa fell within that part of the international capitalist economy from which surplus was drawn to feed the metropolitan sector
as seen earlier exploitation of land and labour is essential for human social advance but only on the assumption that the product is made available within the area where the exploitation takes place according to lenin the new imperialism emphasised the transition of capitalism from free trade to a stage of monopoly capitalism to finance capital
he states it is connected with the intensification of the struggle for the partition of the world
as free trade thrives on exports of commodities monopoly capitalism thrived on the export of capital amassed by profits from banks and industry
this to lenin was the highest stage of capitalism
he goes on to state that this form of capitalism was doomed for war between the capitalists and the exploited nations with the former inevitably losing
war is stated to be the consequence of imperialism
as a continuation of this thought g n
uzoigwe states but it is now clear from more serious investigations of african history in this period that imperialism was essentially economic in its fundamental impulses
classical liberals were generally in abstract opposition to colonialism and imperialism including adam smith fr d ric bastiat richard cobden john bright henry richard herbert spencer h r
fox bourne edward morel josephine butler w j
fox and william ewart gladstone
their philosophies found the colonial enterprise particularly mercantilism in opposition to the principles of free trade and liberal policies
adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations that britain should grant independence to all of its colonies and also argued that it would be economically beneficial for british people in the average although the merchants having mercantilist privileges would lose out
during the colonial era the global process of colonisation served to spread and synthesize the social and political belief systems of the mother countries which often included a belief in a certain natural racial superiority of the race of the mother country
colonialism also acted to reinforce these same racial belief systems within the mother countries themselves
usually also included within the colonial belief systems was a certain belief in the inherent superiority of male over female however this particular belief was often pre existing amongst the pre colonial societies prior to their colonisation
popular political practices of the time reinforced colonial rule by legitimising european and or japanese male authority and also legitimising female and non mother country race inferiority through studies of craniology comparative anatomy and phrenology
biologists naturalists anthropologists and ethnologists of the th century were focused on the study of colonised indigenous women as in the case of georges cuvier s study of sarah baartman
such cases embraced a natural superiority and inferiority relationship between the races based on the observations of naturalists from the mother countries
european studies along these lines gave rise to the perception that african women s anatomy and especially genitalia resembled those of mandrills baboons and monkeys thus differentiating colonised africans from what were viewed as the features of the evolutionarily superior and thus rightfully authoritarian european woman
in addition to what would now be viewed as pseudo scientific studies of race which tended to reinforce a belief in an inherent mother country racial superiority a new supposedly science based ideology concerning gender roles also then emerged as an adjunct to the general body of beliefs of inherent superiority of the colonial era
female inferiority across all cultures was emerging as an idea supposedly supported by craniology that led scientists to argue that the typical brain size of the female human was on the average slightly smaller than that of the male thus inferring that therefore female humans must be less developed and less evolutionarily advanced than males
this finding of relative cranial size difference was later simply attributed to the general typical size difference of the human male body versus that of the typical human female body
within the former european colonies non europeans and women sometimes faced invasive studies by the colonial powers in the interest of the then prevailing pro colonial scientific ideology of the day
such seemingly flawed studies of race and gender coincided with the era of colonialism and the initial introduction of foreign cultures appearances and gender roles into the now gradually widening world views of the scholars of the mother countries
the other or othering is the process of creating a separate entity to persons or groups who are labelled as different or non normal due to the repetition of characteristics
othering is the creation of those who discriminate to distinguish label categorise those who do not fit in the societal norm
several scholars in recent decades developed the notion of the other as an epistemological concept in social theory
for example postcolonial scholars believed that colonising powers explained an other who were there to dominate civilise and extract resources through colonisation of land
political geographers explain how colonial imperial powers countries groups of people etc othered places they wanted to dominate to legalise their exploitation of the land
during and after the rise of colonialism the western powers perceived the east as the other being different and separate from their societal norm
this viewpoint and separation of culture had divided the eastern and western culture creating a dominant subordinate dynamic both being the other towards themselves
post colonialism or post colonial theory can refer to a set of theories in philosophy and literature that grapple with the legacy of colonial rule
in this sense one can regard post colonial literature as a branch of postmodern literature concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires
many practitioners take edward sa d s book orientalism as the theory s founding work although french theorists such as aim c saire and frantz fanon made similar claims decades before sa d
sa d analyzed the works of balzac baudelaire and lautr amont arguing that they helped to shape a societal fantasy of european racial superiority
writers of post colonial fiction interact with the traditional colonial discourse but modify or subvert it for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story
gayatri chakravorty spivak s can the subaltern speak gave its name to subaltern studies
in a critique of postcolonial reason spivak argued that major works of european metaphysics such as those of kant and hegel not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions but actively prevent non europeans from occupying positions as fully human subjects
hegel s phenomenology of spirit famous for its explicit ethnocentrism considers western civilisation as the most accomplished of all while kant also had some traces of racialism in his work
the field of colonistics studies colonialism from such viewpoints as those of economics sociology and psychology
in his essay discourse on colonialism french discours sur le colonialisme french poet aim c saire evaluates the effects of racist sexist and capitalist attitudes and motivations on the civilisations that attempted to colonise other civilisations
in explaining his position he says i admit that it is a good thing to place different civilisations in contact with each other that it is an excellent thing to blend different worlds that whatever its own particular genius may be a civilisation that withdraws into itself atrophies that for civilisations exchange is oxygen however he contends that colonisation is a harmful and counterproductive means of interacting with and learning from neighbouring civilisations
to illustrate his point he explains that colonisation relies on racist and xenophobic frameworks that dehumanise the targets of colonisation and justify their extreme and brutal mistreatment
every time an immoral act perpetrated by colonisers onto the colonised is justified by racist sexist otherwise xenophobic or capitalist motivations to subjugate a group of people the colonising civilisation acquires another dead weight a universal regression takes place a gangrene sets in a centre of infection begins to spread c saire argues the result of this process is that a poison is instilled into the veins of europe and slowly but surely the continent proceeds toward savagery c saire is indicating that the racist and xenophobic justifications for colonisation motivated by capitalist desires ultimately result in the moral and cultural degradation of the colonising nation
thusly colonisation is damaging to the civilisations that participate as perpetrators in a way that is internally harmful
