colonial practice also spur spread colonist language literature cultural institution endangering obliterating native peoples
native culture colonised people also powerful influence imperial country
economic expansion sometimes described colonial surplus ha accompanied imperial expansion since ancient times
greek trade network spread throughout mediterranean region roman trade expanded primary goal directing tribute colonised area towards roman metropole
according strabo time emperor augustus roman ship would set sail every year myos hormos roman egypt india
aztec civilisation developed extensive empire much like roman empire goal exacting tribute conquered colonial areas
aztec significant tribute wa acquisition sacrificial victim religious rituals
hand european colonial empire sometimes attempted channel restrict impede trade involving colony funneling activity metropole taxing accordingly
despite general trend economic expansion economic performance former european colony varies significantly
institution fundamental cause long-run growth economist daron acemoglu simon johnson james a
robinson compare economic influence european colonist different colony study could explain huge discrepancy previous european colony example west african colony like sierra leone hong kong singapore
according paper economic institution determinant colonial success determine financial performance order distribution resources
time institution also consequence political institution especially de facto de jure political power allocated
explain different colonial case thus need look first political institution shaped economic institutions
example one interesting observation reversal fortune le developed civilisation like north america australia new zealand much richer country used prosperous civilisation colonist came like mughals india inca americas
one explanation offered paper focus political institution various colony wa le likely european colonist introduce economic institution could benefit quickly extraction resource area
therefore given developed civilisation denser population european colonist would rather keep existing economic system introduce entirely new system place little extract european colonist would rather establish new economic institution protect interests
political institution thus gave rise different type economic system determined colonial economic performance
european colonisation development also changed gendered system power already place around world
many pre-colonialist area woman maintained power prestige authority reproductive agricultural control
example certain part sub-saharan africa woman maintained farmland usage rights
men would make political communal decision community woman would control village's food supply individual family's land
allowed woman achieve power autonomy even patrilineal patriarchal societies
rise european colonialism came large push development industrialisation economic systems
however working improve productivity european focused mostly male workers
foreign aid arrived form loan land credit tool speed development allocated men
result wa technologic economic class-based gender gap widened time
within colony presence extractive colonial institution given area ha found effect modern day economic development institution infrastructure areas
european nation entered imperial project goal enriching european metropoles
exploitation non-europeans european support imperial goal wa acceptable colonisers

british colonising activity new zealand early century played part ending slave-taking slave-keeping among indigenous mori

labour shortage resulted abolition inspired european coloniser queensland british guaiana fiji example develop new source labour re-adopting system indentured servitude
contract servant would work employer term least year employer agreed pay servant's voyage colony possibly pay return country origin pay employee wage well
employee became indentured employer owed debt back employer travel expense colony expected pay wages
practice indentured servant exploited terrible working condition burdensome debt imposed employer servant mean negotiating debt arrived colony
india china largest source indentured servant colonial era
indentured servant india travelled british colony asia africa caribbean also french portuguese colony chinese servant travelled british dutch colonies
around million indentured servant migrated india million returned india
china sent indentured servant european colony around proportion returned china
following scramble africa early secondary focus colonial regime wa suppression slavery slave trade
end colonial period mostly successful aim though slavery persists africa world large much practice de facto servility despite legislative prohibition
