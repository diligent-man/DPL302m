intercultural learning is an area of research study and application of knowledge about different cultures their differences and similarities
on the one hand it includes a theoretical and academic approach see e g
developmental model of intercultural sensitivity dmis by milton bennett dimensions of culture by geert hofstede
on the other hand it comprises practical applications such as learning to negotiate with people from different cultures living with people from different cultures living in a different culture and the prospect of peace between different cultures
intercultural learning has generated much interest mainly due to the rise of cultural studies and globalization
culture has become an instrument for social interpretation and communicative action
intercultural learning is primarily important in the context of the foreign language classroom
the main goal of intercultural learning is seen as the development of intercultural competence which is the ability to act and relate appropriately and effectively in various cultural contexts
appropriateness
valued rules norms and expectations of the relationship are not violated significantly
effectiveness
values goals or rewards relative to costs and alternatives are accomplished intercultural competence is generally thought to require three components on the learner s side a certain skillset culturally sensitive knowledge and a motivated mindset
in greater detail the skills values and attitudes that constitute intercultural competence include
intercultural attitudes like openness curiosity readiness
general knowledge of the theoretical aspects of how social groups products practices work and interact
skills of interpreting and relating a document of another culture to one s own culture
skills of discovery and interaction like the ability to discover information about another culture and the ability to communicate in real time interaction
critical cultural awareness that there are different cultures next to one s own the teacher trainer or mentor s task is to induce the learning of all in these aspects in the learner
being successful intercultural learning results in culturally competent learners
in the context of intercultural learning it is important to be aware of different subcategories of culture such as little c and big c culture
while the latter one is also called objective culture or formal culture referring to institutions big figures in history literature etc the first one the subjective culture is concerned with the less tangible aspects of a culture like everyday patterns
in intercultural learning a mixture of these two is to be employed but it is especially the apprehension of subjective culture that triggers the development of intercultural competence
also it is important to differentiate between culture specific and culture general approaches when intercultural learning is concerned
culture specific approaches mainly aim at the achievement of competence in a particular target culture c and are closely connected to specific language learning l
competence in both c and l is usually thought to generate culturally appropriate behavior in a particular cultural context
culture general approaches on the other hand are not targeted on a particular culture
instead they are concerned with universal categories which function as general characteristics of cultures in general
these categories can be used to make cross cultural comparisons for example
thus culture general approaches provide a cognitive framework for cultural analysis intercultural learning requires the teacher to employ a mix of culture specific and culture general approaches in order to address the larger issues of ethnocentrism cultural self awareness etc
because intercultural competence cannot be achieved by the single acquisition of knowledge about a specific culture or the pure ability to behave properly in that culture
contexts that are seen as appropriate for intercultural learning in the classroom are those which promote the acquisition of intercultural competence consisting of the components mentioned above
examples
communication between members of different cultures via e mail not yet a standard in everyday schooling but it serves many useful purposes for intercultural learning
authentic print text fictional texts are the ideal medium for intercultural learning since it is the substrate of a specific culture and its history while it simultaneously contains culture general aspects it stimulates personal identification and it offers numerous options for creative activities also it may induce discussions of aspects of subjective as well as objective culture useful examples malorie blackman s noughts and crosses series qaisra shahraz a pair of jeans non fictional texts are definitely useful in this context as well
film authentic film especially improves the language proficiency and thus intercultural sensitivity because it means direct and authentic contact with the l it also guarantees access to the evaluation of audiovisual media and maybe even new media useful examples bend it like beckham save the last dance my beautiful laundretteof particular importance to intercultural learning is understanding cultural differences in learning processes
intercultural learning programs could benefit greatly from the analysis of cultural trends in these processes
by doing so educators can see how indigenous people of america are affected by classroom norms
in indigenous american ways of learning children are included in the community and have lots of experience collaborating with each other and adults in productive ways
for example members of indigenous american and indigenous heritage american communities prefer to learn in collaborative groups as opposed to individually
teachers in zuni schools arrange the students desks in a circle and address the group from the center spinning around slowly to address all members equally
the zuni are a native american tribe from the present day arizona new mexico border
arrangement of student desks in this manner is compatible with the larger cultural trend of preference for collaborative learning
in addition research has shown that communication styles among indigenous and indigenous heritage groups differ from that of european american formal instruction
for example slower talking pace distributed gaze among group members more frequent teacher interruption and longer wait time between teacher question and student response are some qualities of indigenous american learning practices
more specifically all of these behaviors can be observed in navajo students
there appears to be a link between the collaborative preference seen in these specific groups and the conversational styles they prefer to engage in
formal and informal learning are different among westernized cultures and indigenous cultures
both formal and informal learning have two components one looking at it from situations practices and the second one from the learning process
indigenous ways of learning has often been marginalized or discriminated against in formal schooling because it does not follow society ways of learning
being able to understand the learning process through informal learning and making the connection of how it happens in today s society through formal learning can benefit and help us learn much more
it is overly simplified when saying that formal learning happens in institutions and that informal learning happens only outside of institutions analysis of cultural differences in learning can provide new and useful insight that can be applied to intercultural learning practice
in other words learning trends in students cultural backgrounds can be used by teachers to create more well informed pedagogy
for example if indigenous american or indigenous heritage american students were in an intercultural learning program teachers could communicate knowledge by creating a more collaborative setting and by adjusting pace of speech to be consistent with the students
as with most activities employed in the classroom activities for intercultural learning are supposed to keep the affective domain of learning in mind that is they are to keep the students motivated and enable them to somehow identify with topic that is dealt with
for intercultural learning this is especially true because this field is likely to turn into a delicate matter
an example of an activity which focuses on the stereotypes and prejudices that people are likely to have is called who should be hired
this exercise animates students to choose from a huge number of people from different cultures of different sexes and different ages etc the person they would hire from an employer s point of view
most suggested exercises that are believed to support intercultural learning and in this especially to promote empathy are of a role play nature
they especially support students in making the shift in perspective their own culture becomes a strange one and is looked at from the outside while the target culture becomes familiar
events that relate to family and community such as working together help native american students in some classroom aspects
many are used to collaboration so they work in groups and interact with their peers
however they still pay attention when working individually
because native american students are used to collaboration they are able to participate in group activities that don t create a distinction between individual performer and audience
on the other hand they had less willingness to perform or participate verbally when they had to talk alone as an individual rather than group
it was also observed that the native american students didn t want to talk when the teacher was addressing the whole class which shows their preference of working in groups the concept of intercultural learning aiming at the development of intercultural competence also requires a new understanding of the teacher him herself
s he is no longer a mere communicator of knowledge but a mediator and moderator and has to be educated accordingly
in times of globalization and hope for peace this issue needs to be researched further and remain of huge interest
