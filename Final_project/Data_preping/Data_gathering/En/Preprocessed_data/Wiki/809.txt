The Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award MVP is an annual Major League Baseball MLB award given to one outstanding player in the American League and one in the National League Since it has been awarded by the Baseball Writers' Association of America BBWAA Until the winners received the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award which became the official name of the award in in honor of the first MLB commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis who served from until his death on November Starting in Landis’ name no longer appeared on the MVP trophy after the BBWAA received complaints from several former MVP winners about the late Commissioner’s role against integration of MLB
MVP voting takes place before the postseason but the results are not announced until after the World Series The BBWAA began by polling three writers in each league city in reducing that number to two per league city in The BBWAA does not offer a clear cut definition of what most valuable means instead leaving the judgment to the individual voters

Before the season Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile announced he would present a Chalmers Model automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major League Baseball at the end of the season The race for best average in the American League was between the Detroit Tigers' widely disliked Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians On the last day of the season Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits against the St Louis Browns American League President Ban Johnson said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway and Chalmers ended up awarding cars to both players
