the race for best average in the american league was between the detroit tigers widely disliked ty cobb and nap lajoie of the cleveland indians
on the last day of the season lajoie overtook cobb s batting average with seven bunt hits against the st
louis browns
american league president ban johnson said a recalculation showed that cobb had won the race anyway and chalmers ended up awarding cars to both players
the following season chalmers created the chalmers award
a committee of baseball writers were to convene after the season to determine the most important and useful player to the club and to the league
