describes the etymology of the term theravada teachings on the p ram s can be found in late canonical books and post canonical commentaries
theravada commentator dhammapala describes them as noble qualities usually associated with bodhisattas
american scholar monk thanissaro bhikkhu describes them as perfections param of character necessary to achieve enlightenment as one of the three enlightened beings a samma sambuddha a pacceka buddha or an arahant
in the p li canon the buddhava sa of the khuddaka nik ya lists the ten perfections dasa p ramiyo as
d na p ram generosity giving of oneself
s la p ram virtue morality proper conduct
nekkhamma p ram renunciation
pa p ram wisdom discernment
viriya p ram energy diligence vigour effort
khanti p ram patience tolerance forbearance acceptance endurance
sacca p ram truthfulness honesty
adhi h na p ram determination resolution
mett p ram goodwill friendliness loving kindness
upekkh p ram equanimity serenitytwo of the above virtues mett and upekkh also are brahmavih ras and two v rya and upekkha are factors of awakening
the therav da teachings on the p ram s can be found in canonical books jataka tales apad na buddhava sa cariy pi aka and post canonical commentaries written to supplement the p li canon at a later time and thus might not be an original part of the therav da teachings
the oldest parts of the sutta pi aka for example majjhima nik ya digha nik ya sa yutta nik ya and the a guttara nik ya do not have any mention of the p ram s as a category though they are all mentioned individually
some scholars even refer to the teachings of the p ram s as a semi mah y na teaching added to the scriptures at a later time in order to appeal to the interests and needs of the lay community and to popularize their religion
however these views rely on the early scholarly presumption of mah y na originating with religious devotion and appeal to laity
more recently scholars have started to open up early mah y na literature which is very ascetic and expounds the ideal of the monk s life in the forest
therefore the practice of the p ramit s in mah y na buddhism may have been close to the ideals of the ascetic tradition of the rama a
bhikkhu bodhi maintains that in the earliest buddhist texts which he identifies as the first four nik yas those seeking the extinction of suffering nibbana pursued the noble eightfold path
as time went on a backstory was provided for the multi life development of the buddha as a result the ten perfections were identified as part of the path for the bodhisattva p li bodhisatta
over subsequent centuries the p ram s were seen as being significant for aspirants to both buddhahood and arahantship
bhikkhu bodhi summarizes
religious studies scholar dale s
wright states that mah y na texts refer to the p ramit s as bases of training for those looking to achieve enlightenment
wright describes the buddhist p ramit s as a set of character ideals that guide self cultivation and provide a concrete image of the buddhist ideal

according to dhammapala sacca is classified as both la and praj mett and upekkh are classified as dhy na and adhi h na falls under all six
bhikkhu bodhi states that the correlations between the two sets shows there was a shared core before the theravada and mahayana schools split

pra idh na p ramit vow resolution aspiration determination
bala p ramit spiritual power
j na p ramit knowledge the mah ratnak a s tra the sutra of the heap of jewels also includes these additional four p ramit s with number and switched
according to the perspective of tibetan buddhism mah y na practitioners have the choice of two practice paths the path of perfection sanskrit p ramit y na or the path of tantra sanskrit tantray na which is the vajray na
traleg kyabgon rinpoche renders p ramit into english as transcendent action and then frames and qualifies it
