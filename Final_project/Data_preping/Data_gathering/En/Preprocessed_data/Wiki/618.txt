P ramit Sanskrit Pali or p ram P li is a Buddhist term often translated as perfection It is described in Buddhist commentaries as noble character qualities generally associated with enlightened beings P ram and p ramit are both terms in Pali but Pali literature makes greater reference to p ram while Mahayana texts generally use the Sanskrit p ramit
Donald S Lopez Jr describes the etymology of the term Theravada teachings on the p ram s can be found in late canonical books and post canonical commentaries Theravada commentator Dhammapala describes them as noble qualities usually associated with bodhisattas American scholar monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu describes them as perfections param of character necessary to achieve enlightenment as one of the three enlightened beings a samma sambuddha a pacceka buddha or an arahant

The Therav da teachings on the p ram s can be found in canonical books Jataka tales Apad na Buddhava sa Cariy pi aka and post canonical commentaries written to supplement the P li Canon at a later time and thus might not be an original part of the Therav da teachings The oldest parts of the Sutta Pi aka for example Majjhima Nik ya Digha Nik ya Sa yutta Nik ya and the A guttara Nik ya do not have any mention of the p ram s as a category though they are all mentioned individually
Some scholars even refer to the teachings of the p ram s as a semi Mah y na teaching added to the scriptures at a later time in order to appeal to the interests and needs of the lay community and to popularize their religion However these views rely on the early scholarly presumption of Mah y na originating with religious devotion and appeal to laity More recently scholars have started to open up early Mah y na literature which is very ascetic and expounds the ideal of the monk's life in the forest Therefore the practice of the p ramit s in Mah y na Buddhism may have been close to the ideals of the ascetic tradition of the rama a
Bhikkhu Bodhi maintains that in the earliest Buddhist texts which he identifies as the first four nik yas those seeking the extinction of suffering nibbana pursued the noble eightfold path As time went on a backstory was provided for the multi life development of the Buddha as a result the ten perfections were identified as part of the path for the bodhisattva P li bodhisatta Over subsequent centuries the p ram s were seen as being significant for aspirants to both Buddhahood and arahantship Bhikkhu Bodhi summarizes
Religious studies scholar Dale S Wright states that Mah y na texts refer to the p ramit s as bases of training for those looking to achieve enlightenment Wright describes the Buddhist p ramit s as a set of character ideals that guide self cultivation and provide a concrete image of the Buddhist ideal
