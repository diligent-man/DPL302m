Pāramitā Sanskrit Pali पारमिता or pāramī Pāli पारमी is a Buddhist term often translated as perfection It is described in Buddhist commentaries as noble character qualities generally associated with enlightened beings Pāramī and pāramitā are both terms in Pali but Pali literature makes greater reference to pāramī while Mahayana texts generally use the Sanskrit pāramitā
Donald S Lopez Jr describes the etymology of the termTheravada teachings on the pāramīs can be found in late canonical books and post canonical commentaries Theravada commentator Dhammapala describes them as noble qualities usually associated with bodhisattas American scholar monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu describes them as perfections paramī of character necessary to achieve enlightenment as one of the three enlightened beings a samma sambuddha a pacceka buddha or an arahant
In the Pāli Canon the Buddhavaṃsa of the Khuddaka Nikāya lists the ten perfections dasa pāramiyo as
Khanti pāramī patience tolerance forbearance acceptance endurance
Upekkhā pāramī equanimity serenityTwo of the above virtues mettā and upekkhā also are brahmavihāras and two vīrya and upekkha are factors of awakening
The Theravāda teachings on the pāramīs can be found in canonical books Jataka tales Apadāna Buddhavaṃsa Cariyāpiṭaka and post canonical commentaries written to supplement the Pāli Canon at a later time and thus might not be an original part of the Theravāda teachings The oldest parts of the Sutta Piṭaka for example Majjhima Nikāya Digha Nikāya Saṃyutta Nikāya and the Aṅguttara Nikāya do not have any mention of the pāramīs as a category though they are all mentioned individually
Some scholars even refer to the teachings of the pāramīs as a semi Mahāyāna teaching added to the scriptures at a later time in order to appeal to the interests and needs of the lay community and to popularize their religion However these views rely on the early scholarly presumption of Mahāyāna originating with religious devotion and appeal to laity More recently scholars have started to open up early Mahāyāna literature which is very ascetic and expounds the ideal of the monk's life in the forest Therefore the practice of the pāramitās in Mahāyāna Buddhism may have been close to the ideals of the ascetic tradition of the śramaṇa
Bhikkhu Bodhi maintains that in the earliest Buddhist texts which he identifies as the first four nikāyas those seeking the extinction of suffering nibbana pursued the noble eightfold path As time went on a backstory was provided for the multi life development of the Buddha as a result the ten perfections were identified as part of the path for the bodhisattva Pāli bodhisatta Over subsequent centuries the pāramīs were seen as being significant for aspirants to both Buddhahood and arahantship Bhikkhu Bodhi summarizes
Religious studies scholar Dale S Wright states that Mahāyāna texts refer to the pāramitās as bases of training for those looking to achieve enlightenment Wright describes the Buddhist pāramitās as a set of character ideals that guide self cultivation and provide a concrete image of the Buddhist ideal
