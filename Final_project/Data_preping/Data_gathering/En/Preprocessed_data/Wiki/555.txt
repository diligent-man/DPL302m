Alexandre Koyr kw re French kwa e born Alexandr Vladimirovich or Volfovich Koyra Russian August April also anglicized as Alexander Koyre was a French philosopher of Russian origin who wrote on the history and philosophy of science
Koyr was born in the city of Taganrog Russia on August into a Jewish family His original name was Alexandr Vladimirovich or Volfovich Koyra Russian In Imperial Russia he studied in Tiflis Rostov on Don and Odessa before pursuing his studies abroad
At G ttingen Germany he studied under Edmund Husserl and David Hilbert Husserl did not approve of Koyr 's dissertation whereupon Koyr left for Paris to study at the Coll ge de France and the Sorbonne during the period under Bergson Brunschvicg Lalande Delbos and Picavet Following Husserl's Cartesian Meditations a series of lectures given in Paris in February and one of the more important of Husserl's later works Koyr met again with Husserl repeatedly
In he joined the French Foreign Legion as soon as the war broke out In he volunteered for a Russian regiment fighting on the Russian front following a cooperation agreement between the French and Russian governments
In Koyr completed his two State doctorate then called Doctorat s lettres theses The same year he started teaching in Paris at the cole pratique des hautes tudes EPHE and became a colleague of Alexandre Koj ve who eventually replaced him as lecturer on Hegel In he helped found the philosophical journal Recherches philosophiques In the EPHE created a Department of History of Religious Thought in Modern Europe for him to chair He retained this position until his death
During the years and Koyr taught in Fuad University later Cairo University where along with Andr Lalande and others he introduced the study of modern philosophy to Egyptian academia His most important student in Cairo was Abdel Rahman Badawi who is considered the first systematic modern Arab philosopher Koyr later joined the Egyptian National Committee of the Free French
During World War II Koyr lived in New York City and taught at the New School for Social Research including a course on Plato's Theaetetus together with Leo Strauss and Kurt Riezler in the fall of After World War II he was a frequent visitor to the United States spending half a year at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton each year from to and also teaching as a visiting professor at Harvard Yale the University of Chicago the University of Wisconsin and Johns Hopkins His lectures at Johns Hopkins would form the nucleus of one of his best known publications From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe
He died in Paris on April
Though best known as a philosopher of science Koyr started out as a historian of religion Much of his originality for the period rests on his ability to ground his studies of modern science on the history of religion and metaphysics
Koyr focused on Galileo Plato and Isaac Newton His most famous work is From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe a series of lectures given at The Johns Hopkins University in on the rise of early modern science and the change of scientists' perception of the world during the period from Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno through Newton Though the book has been widely heralded it was a summation of Koyr 's perspective rather than an original new work
Koyr was suspicious of scientists' claims to prove natural or fundamental truths through experiments He argued these experiments were based on complicated premises and that they tended to prove the outlook behind these premises rather than any real truth He repeatedly critiqued Galileo's experiments claiming that some of them could not have taken place and disputed the results Galileo claimed and which modern historians of science had hitherto accepted
According to Koyr it was not the experimental or empirical nature of Galileo's and Newton's discoveries that carried the Scientific Revolution of the th and th centuries but a shift in perspective a change in theoretical outlook toward the world Koyr strongly criticised what he called the positivist notion that science should only discover given phenomena the relations between them and certain laws that would help to describe or predict them To Koyr science was at its heart theory an aspiration to know the truth of the world of uncovering the essential structures from which phenomena and the basic laws that relate them spring
Koyr was also interested in the correlations between scientific discoveries and religious or philosophical world views Like Edmund Husserl in his later studies Koyr claimed that modern science had succeeded in overcoming the split inherent in traditional Aristotelian science between Earth and Space since these were now both seen as governed by the same laws On the other hand another split had now been created between the phenomenal world inhabited by man and the purely abstract mathematical world of science Koyr aimed to show how this first world the world of human dwelling personal and historical apparently irrelevant to modern naturalistic research was by no means irrelevant for the very constitution and development of this research Koyr consistently sought to show how scientific truth is always discovered in correlation with specific historical even purely personal circumstances
Koyr 's work can be seen as a systematic analysis of the constitutive achievements that resulted in scientific knowledge but with particular emphasis on the historical and specifically human circumstances that generate the scientists' phenomenal world and serve as foundation for all scientific constitutions of meaning
Koyr influenced major European and American philosophers of science most significantly Thomas Kuhn Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend
In the course of his studies of Galileo Koyr famously claimed that the experiments with weights falling and rolling on inclined planes that Galileo described in his writings probably had not been carried out in practice but were instead thought experiments intended to illustrate his deductions Koyr argued that the precision of the results reported by Galileo was not possible with the technology available to him and quoted the contemporary judgement of Marin Mersenne who had questioned the feasibility of reproducing Galileo's results Furthermore according to Koyr Galileo's science was largely a product of his Platonist philosophy and did not really derive from experimental observations
Koyr 's conclusions were first challenged in by Thomas B Settle who as a graduate student at Cornell University succeeded in reproducing Galileo's experiments with inclined planes using the methods and technologies described in Galileo's writing Later Stillman Drake and others worked through Galileo's notes and demonstrated that Galileo was a careful experimentalist whose observations did play a pivotal role in the development of his scientific system that he later claimed in his published work Koyr has been further criticised for his claim about Galileo's Platonism which he saw as a synonym with mathematics and mathematization of nature As the Italian scholar Lodovico Geymonat has proved in fact Platonism as a tradition does not helpfully illuminate the development of Galileo's mathematical studies which are mostly concerned with applied mathematics engineering and mechanics fields that neither Plato nor Platonist authors were much interested in
