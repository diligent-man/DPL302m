Scituate (/ˈsɪtʃuɪt/ (listen)) is a seacoast town in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, United States, on the South Shore, midway between Boston and Plymouth
 The population was 19,063 at the 2020 census.
The Wampanoag and their neighbors have inhabited the lands Scituate now stands on for thousands of years
The name Scituate is derived from "satuit", the Wampanoag term for cold brook, which refers to a brook that runs to the inner harbor of the town
 In 1710, several European colonizers emigrated to Rhode Island and founded Scituate, Rhode Island, naming it after their previous hometown.
European colonization brought a group of people from Plymouth about 1627, who were joined by colonizers from the county of Kent in England
 They were initially governed by the General Court of Plymouth, but on October 5, 1636, the town incorporated as a separate entity.
The Williams-Barker House, which still remains near the harbor, was built in 1634
Twelve homes and a sawmill were destroyed in King Philip's War in 1676.
In 1717, the western portion of the original land grant was separated and incorporated as the town of Hanover, and in 1788, a section of the town was ceded to Marshfield
 In 1849, another western section became the town of South Scituate, which later changed its name to Norwell
 Since then, the borders have remained essentially unchanged.
Fishing was a significant part of the local economy in the past, as was the sea mossing industry
The sea was historically an integral part of the town with occasional incidents such as that described February 13, 1894, in which eight men clinging to the vessel's rigging on a schooner grounded off Third Cliff apparently died before a large crowd watching from shore "literally frozen to the ropes" while unsuccessful rescue efforts continued through the day and their apparently lifeless bodies were covered by nightfall
A small fishing fleet is still based in Scituate Harbor, although today the town is mostly residential.
In 1810, a lighthouse was erected on the northern edge of Scituate Harbor
This lighthouse is now known as Old Scituate Light
 During the War of 1812, a British naval raiding party having landed on the beach near the lighthouse was deterred by the two daughters of the lighthouse keeper
The young girls, Abigail and Rebecca Bates, marched to and fro behind sand dunes playing a fife and drum loudly
The British invaders were duped into thinking that the American army was approaching and fled
The girls and this incident became known as the "American Army of Two" or "Lighthouse Army of Two"
Descendants of the Bates family still remain in Scituate.
Another notable lighthouse, Minot's Ledge Light, stands approximately one mile off Scituate Neck
The Minot’s Ledge Lighthouse (also known as Minot’s Light) has been nicknamed the “I Love You Lighthouse” due to the 1–4–3 pattern that its light repeatedly emits.
Samuel Woodworth's Old Oaken Bucket house is located in Scituate
 The town is also home to the Lawson Tower, a water tower surrounded by a wooden façade, with an observation deck with views of most of the South Shore from the top.
Financier and muckraker Thomas Lawson built his Dreamworld estate in Scituate
The Lawson Tower remains and the Dreamworld condominium complex pays tribute.
During World War II the Fourth Cliff Military Reservation defended the Scituate area with a battery of two 6-inch guns
It is now a recreation area for Hanscom Air Force Base.
Scituate used to be the site of international broadcasting radio station WNYW, which broadcast on the shortwave bands in the late 1960s.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 31.8 square miles (82.4 km), of which 17.6 square miles (45.7 km) is land and 14.2 square miles (36.8 km), or 44.60%, is water
Scituate is bordered on the east by Massachusetts Bay, on the south by Marshfield, on the west by Norwell and Hingham, all of which are in Plymouth County, and on the northwest by Cohasset, in Norfolk County
 The town is 19 miles (31 km) northeast of Brockton and 25 miles (40 km) southeast of Boston.
Scituate is considered a South Shore community, located just south of the mouth of greater Boston Harbor
 The town is not contiguous; Humarock is a part of Scituate which can only be reached from Marshfield
 The latter was formerly connected to the town, but that connection was lost when the mouth of the South River shifted northward as the result of the Portland Gale of 1898
 The town's shore varies, with the south (along the mouth of the North River) being surrounded by salt marshes, the middle (around Scituate Harbor) being sandy, and the coast of Scituate Neck (Minot) in the north exhibiting exposed granite bedrock
 It is off these rocks that Minot's Ledge lies, home to the town's most famous lighthouse
 The inland of the town is mostly wooded, with several brooks and rivers (including Satuit or "Cold Brook", for which the town is named) running through.
Scituate has five public beaches:  Minot, Sand Hills, Egypt, Peggotty, and Humarock.
The town has no freeways running through it; Massachusetts Route 3 runs through neighboring Norwell
 Route 3A runs through the town, and is known as Chief Justice Cushing Highway for this stretch, named for Chief Justice William Cushing (1732–1810)
 The only other state highway in town is Route 123, which terminates at Route 3A, just 0.7 miles (1.1 km) from the town line.
There is no air service in town; the closest regional airport is Marshfield Municipal Airport, and the closest national and international air service is at Logan International Airport in Boston
 There are two MBTA commuter rail stations
 One is just off Route 3A in North Scituate, and the other is just east of the intersection of Routes 3A and 123 in the Greenbush neighborhood, which is the line's eastern terminus
 The line is connected to an existing line in Braintree, providing service to South Station in Boston.

The annual St
Patrick's Day Parade takes place on the third Sunday in March and runs from Greenbush-Driftway to Scituate Harbor
In addition to the parade, the celebration includes the Mad Hatter's Ball, the Annual Mayor's Race, and the St
Pat's Plunge into the chilly Atlantic Ocean at Peggotty Beach
These events are fundraisers for local charities
With nearly 50% of Scituate residents of Irish descent, St
Patrick's Day festivities are a local favorite.
According to the official parade website, the parade began in Minot, MA in 1995 as a small procession around the block to celebrate St
Patrick's Day on the Irish Riviera
It was started by Jim and Janet Campbell and a few neighbors who had for years been talking about doing a little parade around the neighborhood.
The first parade included a couple of bands and some homemade floats, antique cars, and most of the neighborhood
After a couple of years the town asked the Campbells to move the parade to downtown Scituate Harbor as it was becoming a safety hazard with all the people jamming into the small Minot area to view it
The Campbells agreed, but passed the running of the parade to the Chamber of Commerce
Chamber member Paula Graham ran it for two years and then moved out of state.
Current Parade Chairman Ed Kelley took over the operation in 1999
The Parade was hosted by the Chamber from 1997 until 2015
The Scituate Harbor Business Association became the host in 2016
Now in 2018 the Parade committee is now the sponsoring host under the name "Scituate St
Patrick's Parade Inc
The Parade has since grown in size to 5 times its original length, and runs from the old Gate's Middle School on First Parish Rd
through downtown Front St
Scituate Harbor and ends at 44 Jericho Rd
It is now considered the largest St
Patrick's parade on the South Shore.
Annual outdoor event in the Scituate Harbor area featuring live music, entertainment, artisan crafts, kids activities and historical site visits.
