marquee sports network is a regional sports network operated by sinclair broadcast group and the chicago cubs launched on february
it is devoted exclusively to cubs baseball replacing a trio of channels cable channel nbc sports chicago and broadcast partners wls tv and wgn tv as the exclusive broadcaster of cubs games not shown on national tv
on november in an interview with wscr radio the cubs president of business operations crane kenney stated that the team was seeking to launch its own in house regional sports network after its current broadcast contracts with nbc sports chicago wgn sports and wls tv expire after the season
on december it was reported by the chicago sun times that the team was preparing to launch its rsn marquee in and that sinclair broadcast group was a frontrunner to serve as managing partner
sinclair had previously attempted to purchase wgn s parent company tribune media and runs the national sports network stadium with the white sox s investment arm silver chalice
the venture was officially announced in february to be launched in with sinclair
on may michael mccarthy was named general manager of the marquee sports network after being the cubs consultant on the channel
he is the former president of the msg network and a former top official with the milwaukee bucks coo and the st
louis blues vice chairman
on august a consortium of sinclair and entertainment studios acquired fox sports networks for billion thus making marquee a sister to them fsn previously operated a chicago network but it became defunct when chicago s professional teams abandoned it in favor of a joint venture with comcast currently known as nbc sports chicago
the divestiture was mandated as part of disney s acquisition of st century fox who chose not to retain the networks under its successor fox corporation
early reception of marquee was mixed by fans culminating in fans booing cubs chairman tom ricketts during the annual cubs convention in after mention of the new network
marquee sports network officially launched on february at p m
ct with its first program being a launch special hosted by actor and cubs fan bill murray followed by a documentary on ernie banks
the channel aired its first live spring training game against the oakland athletics at sloan park later in the day the game had been postponed from the afternoon due to the threat of rain
however because the start of the season was postponed due to the covid pandemic its first regular season game was not until july
marquee s cubs broadcasts underwent tweaks for the season
alongside its new play by play voice jon sciambi the network would no longer require commentators to wear a suit and tie on air a mandate made during the inaugural season by executives insisting that marquee s broadcasts have a national network quality and replaced an unorthodox bottom centered score bar it had used during the first season with a more traditional scoreboard in the top left of the screen a move which also differentiated marquee from its newly relaunched sister networks in the bally sports group whose on air branding was derived from that of marquee but with an equally unorthodox integration of a scoreboard and ticker
the network would use the slogan we get it in a marketing campaign to promote the new cubs season and these tweaks
the cubs previous television commentators len kasper play by play and jim j d deshaies color retained their roles on marquee at the channel s launch
on may it was reported that david kaplan nbc sports chicago studio host for cubs games had renewed his contract with the channel dispelling rumors that he planned to join marquee
cole wright formerly of nfl network will serve as studio host and taylor mcgregor formerly field reporter for the colorado rockies on at t sportsnet rocky mountain will serve as field reporter
the channel also brought on bob vorwald former executive producer of wgn sports
after the season kasper left the cubs and marquee to become the radio voice of the chicago white sox on wmvp
jon sciambi then a television and radio play by play voice on espn s mlb national broadcasts was hired to replace kasper
chris myers beth mowins and longtime cubs radio broadcaster pat hughes will act as fill in announcers when sciambi is not available
