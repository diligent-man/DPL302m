Marquee Sports Network is a regional sports network operated by Sinclair Broadcast Group and the Chicago Cubs launched on February It is devoted exclusively to Cubs baseball replacing a trio of channels cable channel NBC Sports Chicago and broadcast partners WLS TV and WGN TV as the exclusive broadcaster of Cubs games not shown on national TV
On November in an interview with WSCR radio the Cubs' president of business operations Crane Kenney stated that the team was seeking to launch its own in house regional sports network after its current broadcast contracts with NBC Sports Chicago WGN Sports and WLS TV expire after the season
On December it was reported by the Chicago Sun Times that the team was preparing to launch its RSN Marquee in and that Sinclair Broadcast Group was a frontrunner to serve as managing partner Sinclair had previously attempted to purchase WGN's parent company Tribune Media and runs the national sports network Stadium with the White Sox's investment arm Silver Chalice The venture was officially announced in February to be launched in with Sinclair
On May Michael McCarthy was named general manager of the Marquee Sports Network after being the Cubs' consultant on the channel He is the former president of the MSG Network and a former top official with the Milwaukee Bucks COO and the St Louis Blues vice chairman
On August a consortium of Sinclair and Entertainment Studios acquired Fox Sports Networks for billion thus making Marquee a sister to them FSN previously operated a Chicago network but it became defunct when Chicago's professional teams abandoned it in favor of a joint venture with Comcast—currently known as NBC Sports Chicago The divestiture was mandated as part of Disney's acquisition of st Century Fox who chose not to retain the networks under its successor Fox Corporation
Early reception of Marquee was mixed by fans culminating in fans booing Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts during the annual Cubs Convention in after mention of the new network
Marquee Sports Network officially launched on February at pm CT with its first program being a launch special hosted by actor and Cubs fan Bill Murray followed by a documentary on Ernie Banks The channel aired its first live spring training game against the Oakland Athletics at Sloan Park later in the day the game had been postponed from the afternoon due to the threat of rain However because the start of the season was postponed due to the COVID pandemic its first regular season game was not until July
Marquee's Cubs broadcasts underwent tweaks for the season Alongside its new play by play voice Jon Sciambi the network would no longer require commentators to wear a suit and tie on air a mandate made during the inaugural season by executives insisting that Marquee's broadcasts have a national network quality and replaced an unorthodox bottom centered score bar it had used during the first season with a more traditional scoreboard in the top left of the screen a move which also differentiated Marquee from its newly relaunched sister networks in the Bally Sports group whose on air branding was derived from that of Marquee but with an equally unorthodox integration of a scoreboard and ticker
The network would use the slogan We get it in a marketing campaign to promote the new Cubs season and these tweaks
The Cubs' previous television commentators Len Kasper play by play and Jim JD Deshaies color retained their roles on Marquee at the channel's launch On May it was reported that David Kaplan—NBC Sports Chicago studio host for Cubs games—had renewed his contract with the channel dispelling rumors that he planned to join Marquee Cole Wright formerly of NFL Network will serve as studio host and Taylor McGregor formerly field reporter for the Colorado Rockies on ATT SportsNet Rocky Mountain will serve as field reporter The channel also brought on Bob Vorwald former executive producer of WGN Sports
After the season Kasper left the Cubs and Marquee to become the radio voice of the Chicago White Sox on WMVP Jon Sciambi then a television and radio play by play voice on ESPN's MLB national broadcasts was hired to replace Kasper Chris Myers Beth Mowins and longtime Cubs radio broadcaster Pat Hughes will act as fill in announcers when Sciambi is not available
Besides game broadcasts Marquee will carry documentaries game replays and player profiles as well as coverage of minor league games The channel might attempt to pick up college basketball for the winter time Stadium and the Bally Sports networks would provide some programming

Upon the announcement of the channel the network's ability to gain carriage was compared to the troubled negotiations of the Los Angeles Dodgers' SportsNet LA Industry observer Phillip Swan thought Marquee would have a chance of working while commenting How can you not look at the disaster of the SportsNet LA scene and not be a little skeptical Charter has since come to terms with DirecTV to carry SportsNet LA
Industry experts predicted that Marquee would seek around per subscriber placing it behind YES Network and ESPN Sinclair secured Marquee's first major carriage agreement with Charter Communications on July As part of the multi year carriage agreement Marquee was bundled alongside Sinclair's owned and operated television stations Tennis Channel and the regional Fox Sports Networks that Sinclair was in the process of buying from Disney at the time
On October ATT agreed to carry Marquee on its television services including DirecTV the second largest provider serving the region behind Comcast as part of a larger multi year carriage agreement with Sinclair Sinclair later reached a deal with Mediacom on November to carry Marquee Sports Network On February the network announced an agreement to carry the network on Hulu's live streaming service On February the network announced an agreement with WOW cable
Comcast the largest television provider in the region with an estimated million subscribers reached an agreement to carry Marquee on July in time for the Cubs' opening game as part of a larger renewal for Sinclair owned television stations and cable networks
Until May Marquee's deal with DirecTV was for in market coverage only Unlike many other regional sports networks Marquee was not included in DirecTV's Sports Pack which carries RSNs nationwide with appropriate blackouts of professional events That changed May with the announcement that Marquee would be available nationwide with the Sports Pack albeit with the appropriate blackouts
Dish Network and YouTube TV which has indicated they have no deal for Marquee's sister RSNs after February and would remove them from the platform on that date have not reached an agreement with Sinclair to carry Marquee Sports Network
Additionally Marquee also has the rights to the games for the Cubs' Minor League Baseball clubs including Des Moines's Iowa Cubs and the South Bend Cubs ending deals with local broadcast subchannels to leverage Iowa and northern Indiana cable systems into carrying the network
