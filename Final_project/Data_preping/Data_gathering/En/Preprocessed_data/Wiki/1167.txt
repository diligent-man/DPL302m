personality characteristic set behavior cognition emotional pattern evolve biological environmental factors
generally agreed upon definition personality theory focus motivation psychological interaction environment one surrounded by
trait-based personality theory defined raymond cattell define personality trait predict individual's behavior
study psychology personality called personality psychology attempt explain tendency underlie difference behavior
psychologist taken many different approach study personality including biological cognitive learning trait-based theory well psychodynamic humanistic approaches
various approach used study personality today reflect influence first theorist field group includes sigmund freud alfred adler gordon allport han eysenck abraham maslow carl rogers
due fact personality complex idea dimension personality scale test vary often poorly defined
two main tool measure personality objective test projective measures
example test big five inventory bfi minnesota multiphasic personality inventory mmpi- rorschach inkblot test neurotic personality questionnaire kon- eysenck's personality questionnaire epq-r
test beneficial reliability validity two factor make test accurate
item influenced degree underlying trait construct giving rise pattern positive intercorrelations long item oriented worded direction recent well-known measuring tool psychologist use pf
psychologist also use clinical measuring tool diagnose psychiatric disorder help prognosis therapy planning
personality frequently broken factor dimension statistically extracted large questionnaire factor analysis
brought back two dimension often dimension introvert-extrovert neuroticism emotionally unstable-stable used first proposed eysenck s
many factor analysis found called big five openness experience conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness neuroticism emotional stability known ocean
component generally stable time half variance appears attributable person's genetics rather effect one's environment
research ha investigated whether relationship happiness extraversion saw adult also seen children
implication finding help identify child likely experience episode depression develop type treatment child likely respond to
child adult research show genetics opposed environmental factor exert greater influence happiness levels
personality stable course lifetime change much quickly childhood personality construct child referred temperament
another interesting finding ha link found acting extraverted positive affect
extraverted behavior include acting talkative assertive adventurous outgoing
purpose study positive affect defined experience happy enjoyable emotions
study investigated effect acting way counter person's dispositional nature
word study focused benefit drawback introvert people shy socially inhibited non-aggressive acting extraverted extravert acting introverted
acting extraverted introverts' experience positive affect increased whereas extravert seemed experience lower level positive affect suffered phenomenon ego depletion
ego depletion cognitive fatigue use one's energy overtly act way contrary one's inner disposition
people act contrary fashion divert cognitive energy toward regulating foreign style behavior attitudes
available energy used maintain contrary behavior result inability use energy make important difficult decision plan future control regulate emotion perform effectively cognitive tasks
one question ha posed extrovert tend happier introverts
two type explanation attempt account difference instrumental theory temperamental theories
instrumental theory suggests extravert end making choice place positive situation also react strongly introvert positive situations
temperamental theory suggests extrovert disposition generally lead experience higher degree positive affect
study extraversion lucas baird found statistically significant support instrumental theory however find extravert generally experience higher level positive affect
research ha done uncover mediator responsible correlation extraversion happiness
self-efficacy one's belief ability perform personal standard ability produce desired result feeling ability make important life decisions
self-efficacy ha found related personality trait extraversion subjective well-being
self-efficacy however partially mediates relationship extraversion neuroticism subjective happiness
implies likely factor mediate relationship subjective happiness personality traits
individual greater degree confidence ability seem higher degree subjective well-being higher level extraversion
research ha examined phenomenon mood maintenance another possible mediator
mood maintenance ability maintain one's average level happiness face ambiguous situation meaning situation ha potential engender either positive negative emotion different individuals
mean happiness level extraverted individual le susceptible influence external events
finding implies extraverts' positive mood last longer introverts
modern conception personality temperament character inventory suggested four basic temperament thought reflect basic automatic response danger reward rely associative learning
four temperament harm avoidance reward dependence novelty-seeking persistence somewhat analogous ancient conception melancholic sanguine choleric phlegmatic personality type although temperament reflect dimension rather distance categories
harm avoidance trait ha associated increased reactivity insular amygdala salience network well reduced ht receptor binding peripherally reduced gaba concentrations
novelty seeking ha associated reduced activity insular salience network increased striatal connectivity
novelty seeking correlate dopamine synthesis capacity striatum reduced auto receptor availability midbrain
reward dependence ha linked oxytocin system increased concentration plasma oxytocin observed well increased volume oxytocin-related region hypothalamus
persistence ha associated increased striatal-mpfc connectivity increased activation ventral striatal-orbitofrontal-anterior cingulate circuit well increased salivary amylase level indicative increased noradrenergic tone
ha shown personality trait malleable environmental influence researcher originally believed
one study ha shown home environment specifically type parent person ha affect shape personality
mary ainsworth's strange situation experiment showcased baby reacted mother leave alone room stranger
different style attachment labeled ainsworth secure ambivalent avoidant disorganized
child securely attached tend trusting sociable confident day-to-day life
child disorganized reported higher level anxiety anger risk-taking behavior
judith rich harris's group socialization theory postulate individual's peer group rather parental figure primary influence personality behavior adulthood
intra- intergroup process dyadic relationship parent-child relationship responsible transmission culture environmental modification children's personality characteristics
thus theory point peer group representing environmental influence child's personality rather parental style home environment
tessuya kawamoto's personality change life experience moderation effect attachment security talked significant laboratory tests
study mainly focused effect life experience change personality life experiences
assessment suggested accumulation small daily experience may work personality development university student environmental influence may vary individual susceptibility experience like attachment security
study suggest shared family environment sibling ha le influence personality individual experience child
identical twin similar personality largely share genetic makeup rather shared environment
ha recent debate subject studying personality different culture
people think personality come entirely culture therefore meaningful study cross-culture study
hand many believe element shared culture effort made demonstrate cross-cultural applicability big five
cross-cultural assessment depends universality personality trait whether common trait among human regardless culture factors
common foundation personality studied basis human trait rather within certain cultures
measured comparing whether assessment tool measuring similar construct across country cultures
two approach researching personality looking emic etic traits
emic trait construct unique culture determined local custom thought belief characteristics
etic trait considered universal construct establish trait evident across culture represent biological basis human personality
personality trait unique individual culture different trait apparent different cultures
however idea personality trait universal across culture supported establishing five-factor model personality across multiple translation neo-pi-r one widely used personality measures
administering neo-pi-r people across six language result show similar pattern five underlying construct found american factor structure
similar result found using big five inventory bfi wa administered nation across languages
five factor continued supported conceptually statistically across major region world suggesting underlying factor common across cultures
difference across culture may consequence using lexical approach study personality structure language ha limitation translation different culture unique word describe emotion situations
difference across culture could due real cultural difference could also consequence poor translation biased sampling difference response style across cultures
examining personality questionnaire developed within culture also useful evidence universality trait across culture underlying factor still found
result several european asian study found overlapping dimension five-factor model well additional culture-unique dimensions
finding similar factor across culture provides support universality personality trait structure research necessary gain stronger support

william james argued temperament explains great deal controversy history philosophy arguing influential premise argument philosophers
despite seeking impersonal reason conclusion james argued temperament philosopher influenced philosophy
bias james explained wa consequence trust philosopher place temperament
james thought significance observation lay premise philosophy objective measure success whether philosophy peculiar philosopher whether philosopher dissatisfied way seeing thing not
james argued temperament may basis several division academia focused philosophy lecture pragmatism
fact james' lecture fashioned sort trait theory empiricist rationalist camp philosophy
modern trait theory trait camp described james distinct opposite maybe possessed different proportion continuum thus characterize personality philosopher camp
personality rationalist philosopher described tender-minded going principle empiricist philosopher described tough-minded going fact james distinguishes term philosophical claim made arguing claim made primarily basis temperament
furthermore categorization wa incidental james' purpose explaining pragmatist philosophy exhaustive
according james temperament rationalist philosopher differed fundamentally temperament empiricist philosopher day
tendency rationalist philosopher toward refinement superficiality never satisfied empiricist temper mind
rationalism lead creation closed system optimism considered shallow fact-loving mind perfection far off
british empiricist john locke's explanation personal identity provides example james referred to
personality basis precise definition identity meaning identity differs according applied to
identity person quite distinct identity man woman substance according locke
locke concludes consciousness personality always accompanies thinking make everyone call self remains constant different place different times
rationalist conceived identity person differently empiricist locke distinguished identity substance person life
according locke rene descartes agreed insofar argue one immaterial spirit basis person fear making brute thinking thing according james locke tolerated argument soul wa behind consciousness person
however locke's successor david hume empirical psychologist denied soul except term describe cohesion inner lives
however research suggests hume excluded personal identity opus inquiry concerning human understanding thought argument wa sufficient compelling
descartes distinguished active passive faculty mind contributing thinking consciousness different ways
passive faculty descartes argued simply receives whereas active faculty produce form idea doe presuppose thought thus cannot within thinking thing
active faculty within self idea produced without awareness sometimes produced one's will
rationalist philosopher benedictus spinoza argued idea first element constituting human mind existed actually existing things
word idea non-existent thing without meaning spinoza idea non-existent thing cannot exist
spinoza's rationalism argued mind doe know except insofar perceives idea modification body describing external perception perception without
contrary within spinoza argued perception connect various idea clearly distinctly
spinoza equates understanding explains common distinction thing two different thing error result individual's misunderstanding nature thinking
