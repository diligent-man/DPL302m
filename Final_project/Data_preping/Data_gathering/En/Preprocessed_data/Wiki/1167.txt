personality is the characteristic sets of behaviors cognitions and emotional patterns that evolve from biological and environmental factors
while there is no generally agreed upon definition of personality most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with the environment one is surrounded by
trait based personality theories such as those defined by raymond cattell define personality as traits that predict an individual s behavior
on the other hand more behaviorally based approaches define personality through learning and habits
nevertheless most theories view personality as relatively stable
the study of the psychology of personality called personality psychology attempts to explain the tendencies that underlie differences in behavior
psychologists have taken many different approaches to the study of personality including biological cognitive learning and trait based theories as well as psychodynamic and humanistic approaches
the various approaches used to study personality today reflect the influence of the first theorists in the field a group that includes sigmund freud alfred adler gordon allport hans eysenck abraham maslow and carl rogers
personality can be determined through a variety of tests
due to the fact that personality is a complex idea the dimensions of personality and scales of such tests vary and often are poorly defined
two main tools to measure personality are objective tests and projective measures
examples of such tests are the big five inventory bfi minnesota multiphasic personality inventory mmpi rorschach inkblot test neurotic personality questionnaire kon or eysenck s personality questionnaire epq r
all of these tests are beneficial because they have both reliability and validity two factors that make a test accurate
each item should be influenced to a degree by the underlying trait construct giving rise to a pattern of positive intercorrelations so long as all items are oriented worded in the same direction a recent but not well known measuring tool that psychologists use is the pf
it measures personality based on cattell s factor theory of personality
psychologists also use it as a clinical measuring tool to diagnose psychiatric disorders and help with prognosis and therapy planning
personality is frequently broken into factors or dimensions statistically extracted from large questionnaires through factor analysis
when brought back to two dimensions often the dimensions of introvert extrovert and neuroticism emotionally unstable stable are used as first proposed by eysenck in the s
many factor analyses found what is called the big five which are openness to experience conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism or emotional stability known as ocean
these components are generally stable over time and about half of the variance appears to be attributable to a person s genetics rather than the effects of one s environment
some research has investigated whether the relationship between happiness and extraversion saw in adults also can be seen in children
the implications of these findings can help identify children that are more likely to experience episodes of depression and develop types of treatment that such children are likely to respond to
in both children and adults research shows that genetics as opposed to environmental factors exert a greater influence on happiness levels
personality is not stable over the course of a lifetime but it changes much more quickly during childhood so personality constructs in children are referred to as temperament
temperament is regarded as the precursor to personality
another interesting finding has been the link found between acting extraverted and positive affect
extraverted behaviors include acting talkative assertive adventurous and outgoing
for the purposes of this study positive affect is defined as experiences of happy and enjoyable emotions
this study investigated the effects of acting in a way that is counter to a person s dispositional nature
in other words the study focused on the benefits and drawbacks of introverts people who are shy socially inhibited and non aggressive acting extraverted and of extraverts acting introverted
after acting extraverted introverts experience of positive affect increased whereas extraverts seemed to experience lower levels of positive affect and suffered from the phenomenon of ego depletion
ego depletion or cognitive fatigue is the use of one s energy to overtly act in a way that is contrary to one s inner disposition
when people act in a contrary fashion they divert most if not all cognitive energy toward regulating this foreign style of behavior and attitudes
because all available energy is being used to maintain this contrary behavior the result is an inability to use any energy to make important or difficult decisions plan for the future control or regulate emotions or perform effectively on other cognitive tasks
one question that has been posed is why extroverts tend to be happier than introverts
the two types of explanations that attempt to account for this difference are instrumental theories and temperamental theories
the instrumental theory suggests that extraverts end up making choices that place them in more positive situations and they also react more strongly than introverts to positive situations
the temperamental theory suggests that extroverts have a disposition that generally leads them to experience a higher degree of positive affect
in their study of extraversion lucas and baird found no statistically significant support for the instrumental theory but did however find that extraverts generally experience a higher level of positive affect
research has been done to uncover some of the mediators that are responsible for the correlation between extraversion and happiness
self esteem and self efficacy are two such mediators
self efficacy is one s belief about abilities to perform up to personal standards the ability to produce desired results and the feeling of having some ability to make important life decisions
self efficacy has been found to be related to the personality traits of extraversion and subjective well being
self efficacy however only partially mediates the relationship between extraversion and neuroticism and subjective happiness
this implies that there are most likely other factors that mediate the relationship between subjective happiness and personality traits
self esteem maybe another similar factor
individuals with a greater degree of confidence about themselves and their abilities seem to have both higher degrees of subjective well being and higher levels of extraversion
other research has examined the phenomenon of mood maintenance as another possible mediator
mood maintenance is the ability to maintain one s average level of happiness in the face of an ambiguous situation meaning a situation that has the potential to engender either positive or negative emotions in different individuals
it has been found to be a stronger force in extroverts
this means that the happiness levels of extraverted individuals are less susceptible to the influence of external events
this finding implies that extraverts positive moods last longer than those of introverts
modern conceptions of personality such as the temperament and character inventory have suggested four basic temperaments that are thought to reflect basic and automatic responses to danger and reward that rely on associative learning
the four temperaments harm avoidance reward dependence novelty seeking and persistence are somewhat analogous to ancient conceptions of melancholic sanguine choleric phlegmatic personality types although the temperaments reflect dimensions rather than distance categories
the harm avoidance trait has been associated with increased reactivity in insular and amygdala salience networks as well as reduced ht receptor binding peripherally and reduced gaba concentrations
novelty seeking has been associated with reduced activity in insular salience networks increased striatal connectivity
novelty seeking correlates with dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum and reduced auto receptor availability in the midbrain
reward dependence has been linked with the oxytocin system with increased concentration of plasma oxytocin being observed as well as increased volume in oxytocin related regions of the hypothalamus
persistence has been associated with increased striatal mpfc connectivity increased activation of ventral striatal orbitofrontal anterior cingulate circuits as well as increased salivary amylase levels indicative of increased noradrenergic tone
it has been shown that personality traits are more malleable by environmental influences than researchers originally believed
personality differences predict the occurrence of life experiences
one study has shown how the home environment specifically the types of parents a person has can affect and shape their personality
mary ainsworth s strange situation experiment showcased how babies reacted to having their mother leave them alone in a room with a stranger
the different styles of attachment labeled by ainsworth were secure ambivalent avoidant and disorganized
children who were securely attached tend to be more trusting sociable and are confident in their day to day life
children who were disorganized were reported to have higher levels of anxiety anger and risk taking behavior
judith rich harris s group socialization theory postulates that an individual s peer groups rather than parental figures are the primary influence of personality and behavior in adulthood
intra and intergroup processes not dyadic relationships such as parent child relationships are responsible for the transmission of culture and for environmental modification of children s personality characteristics
thus this theory points at the peer group representing the environmental influence on a child s personality rather than the parental style or home environment
tessuya kawamoto s personality change from life experiences moderation effect of attachment security talked about some significant laboratory tests
the study mainly focused on the effects of life experiences on change in personality and life experiences
the assessments suggested that the accumulation of small daily experiences may work for the personality development of university students and that environmental influences may vary by individual susceptibility to experiences like attachment security
some studies suggest that a shared family environment between siblings has less influence on personality than individual experiences of each child
identical twins have similar personalities largely because they share the same genetic makeup rather than their shared environment
there has been some recent debate over the subject of studying personality in a different culture
some people think that personality comes entirely from culture and therefore there can be no meaningful study in cross culture study
on the other hand many believe that some elements are shared by all cultures and an effort is being made to demonstrate the cross cultural applicability of the big five
cross cultural assessment depends on the universality of personality traits which is whether there are common traits among humans regardless of culture or other factors
if there is a common foundation of personality then it can be studied on the basis of human traits rather than within certain cultures
this can be measured by comparing whether assessment tools are measuring similar constructs across countries or cultures
two approaches to researching personality are looking at emic and etic traits
emic traits are constructs unique to each culture which are determined by local customs thoughts beliefs and characteristics
etic traits are considered universal constructs which establish traits that are evident across cultures that represent a biological basis of human personality
if personality traits are unique to the individual culture then different traits should be apparent in different cultures
however the idea that personality traits are universal across cultures is supported by establishing the five factor model of personality across multiple translations of the neo pi r which is one of the most widely used personality measures
when administering the neo pi r to people across six languages the results show a similar pattern of the same five underlying constructs that are found in the american factor structure
similar results were found using the big five inventory bfi as it was administered in nations across languages
the five factors continued to be supported both conceptually and statistically across major regions of the world suggesting that these underlying factors are common across cultures
there are some differences across culture but they may be a consequence of using a lexical approach to study personality structures as language has limitations in translation and different cultures have unique words to describe emotion or situations
differences across cultures could be due to real cultural differences but they could also be consequences of poor translations biased sampling or differences in response styles across cultures
examining personality questionnaires developed within a culture can also be useful evidence for the universality of traits across cultures as the same underlying factors can still be found
results from several european and asian studies have found overlapping dimensions with the five factor model as well as additional culture unique dimensions
finding similar factors across cultures provides support for the universality of personality trait structure but more research is necessary to gain stronger support
the modern sense of individual personality is a result of the shifts in culture originating in the renaissance an essential element in modernity
in contrast the medieval european s sense of self was linked to a network of social roles the household the kinship network the guild the corporation these were the building blocks of personhood
stephen greenblatt observes in recounting the recovery and career of lucretius poem de rerum natura at the core of the poem lay key principles of a modern understanding of the world dependent on the family the individual alone was nothing jacques g lis observes
the characteristic mark of the modern man has two parts one internal the other external one dealing with his environment the other with his attitudes values and feelings rather than being linked to a network of social roles the modern man is largely influenced by the environmental factors such as urbanization education mass communication industrialization and politicization in for example scientists reported a relationship between personality and political views as follows preschool children who years later were relatively liberal were characterized as developing close relationships self reliant energetic somewhat dominating relatively under controlled and resilient
preschool children subsequently relatively conservative at age were described as feeling easily victimized easily offended indecisive fearful rigid inhibited and relatively over controlled and vulnerable
william james argued that temperament explains a great deal of the controversies in the history of philosophy by arguing that it is a very influential premise in the arguments of philosophers
despite seeking only impersonal reasons for their conclusions james argued the temperament of philosophers influenced their philosophy
temperament thus conceived is tantamount to a bias
such bias james explained was a consequence of the trust philosophers place in their own temperament
james thought the significance of his observation lay on the premise that in philosophy an objective measure of success is whether philosophy is peculiar to its philosopher or not and whether a philosopher is dissatisfied with any other way of seeing things or not
james argued that temperament may be the basis of several divisions in academia but focused on philosophy in his lectures on pragmatism
in fact james lecture of fashioned a sort of trait theory of the empiricist and rationalist camps of philosophy
as in most modern trait theories the traits of each camp are described by james as distinct and opposite and maybe possessed in different proportions on a continuum and thus characterize the personality of philosophers of each camp
the mental make up i e
personality of rationalist philosophers is described as tender minded and going by principles and that of empiricist philosophers is described as tough minded and going by facts james distinguishes each not only in terms of the philosophical claims they made in but by arguing that such claims are made primarily on the basis of temperament
furthermore such categorization was only incidental to james purpose of explaining his pragmatist philosophy and is not exhaustive
according to james the temperament of rationalist philosophers differed fundamentally from the temperament of empiricist philosophers of his day
the tendency of rationalist philosophers toward refinement and superficiality never satisfied an empiricist temper of mind
rationalism leads to the creation of closed systems and such optimism is considered shallow by the fact loving mind for whom perfection is far off
rationalism is regarded as pretension and a temperament most inclined to abstraction
empiricists on the other hand stick with the external senses rather than logic
british empiricist john locke s explanation of personal identity provides an example of what james referred to
locke explains the identity of a person i e
personality on the basis of a precise definition of identity by which the meaning of identity differs according to what it is being applied to
the identity of a person is quite distinct from the identity of a man woman or substance according to locke
locke concludes that consciousness is personality because it always accompanies thinking it is that which makes everyone to be what he calls self and remains constant in different places at different times
rationalists conceived of the identity of persons differently than empiricists such as locke who distinguished identity of substance person and life
according to locke rene descartes agreed only insofar as he did not argue that one immaterial spirit is the basis of the person for fear of making brutes thinking things too according to james locke tolerated arguments that a soul was behind the consciousness of any person
however locke s successor david hume and empirical psychologists after him denied the soul except for being a term to describe the cohesion of inner lives
however some research suggests hume excluded personal identity from his opus an inquiry concerning human understanding because he thought his argument was sufficient but not compelling
descartes himself distinguished active and passive faculties of mind each contributing to thinking and consciousness in different ways
the passive faculty descartes argued simply receives whereas the active faculty produces and forms ideas but does not presuppose thought and thus cannot be within the thinking thing
the active faculty mustn t be within self because ideas are produced without any awareness of them and are sometimes produced against one s will
rationalist philosopher benedictus spinoza argued that ideas are the first element constituting the human mind but existed only for actually existing things
in other words ideas of non existent things are without meaning for spinoza because an idea of a non existent thing cannot exist
further spinoza s rationalism argued that the mind does not know itself except insofar as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of body in describing its external perceptions or perceptions from without
on the contrary from within spinoza argued perceptions connect various ideas clearly and distinctly
the mind is not the free cause of its actions for spinoza
spinoza equates the will with the understanding and explains the common distinction of these things as being two different things as an error which results from the individual s misunderstanding of the nature of thinking
the biological basis of personality is the theory that anatomical structures located in the brain contribute to personality traits
this stems from neuropsychology which studies how the structure of the brain relates to various psychological processes and behaviors
for instance in human beings the frontal lobes are responsible for foresight and anticipation and the occipital lobes are responsible for processing visual information
in addition certain physiological functions such as hormone secretion also affect personality
for example the hormone testosterone is important for sociability affectivity aggressiveness and sexuality
additionally studies show that the expression of a personality trait depends on the volume of the brain cortex it is associated with
personology confers a multidimensional complex and comprehensive approach to personality
according to henry a
murray personology is from a holistic perspective personology studies personality as a whole as a system but at the same time through all its components levels and spheres
