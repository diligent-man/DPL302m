The Philadelphia Eagles season was the franchise's th season in the National Football League and the tenth under head coach Andy Reid
The Eagles improved upon their record and a fourth-place finish in the NFC East in the season by going and earning the th seed in the NFC Playoffs
The Eagles defeated the Minnesota Vikings - in the Wild Card Round
Philadelphia then upset the top-seeded New York Giants - in the Divisional Round to advance to the NFC Championship Game for the first time since the season
However the Eagles' Cinderella run would end in Arizona with a - loss to the Arizona Cardinals
Despite their low-seeding in the NFC playoffs Football Outsiders calculated that the Eagles were the best team in the league play-for-play
The Eagles were mentioned in the novel but the Eagles were in the film adaptation of Silver Linings Playbook
Though the Eagles finished the season strong winning their final three games they finished and in last place in a tough division
In the off-season the Eagles made noise by signing star cornerback Asante Samuel from the New England Patriots on February the first day that he became available
Samuel signed to a six-year million contract was considered the top player available in free agency and was Philadelphia's biggest signing since Terrell Owens in
The Eagles also signed defensive end Chris Clemons and gave him a sizable signing bonus but he struggled with injuries in the preseason and barely made the team
Oft-injured defensive lineman Jevon Kearse returned to the Tennessee Titans and Takeo Spikes was released with a young corps of linebackers ready to replace him
Smith who has battled injury was given a franchise tag to keep him in Philadelphia
In the draft the Eagles traded down again lining themselves up with two first-round picks in
Training camp and the preseason were mixed with good news and bad news
On the negative side All-Pro guard Shawn Andrews had a late-start to the preseason because of a personal battle with depression
Cornerback Lito Sheppard now looked like a third wheel in the secondary behind Samuel and Sheldon Brown and vented his frustration
A contract dispute with star running back Brian Westbrook also looked to be another distraction until the team signed him to a three-year million extension
Philadelphia's biggest issue was the weak receiving corps
In the spring the team was unsuccessful in acquiring a big name receiver and the situation was exacerbated when number one receiver Kevin Curtis went down with a sports hernia in the preseason while number two receiver Reggie Brown nursed a sore hamstring
No moves were made to fix the problem and many experts considered the Eagles too weak at the position to go deep into the playoffs
However ' second round draft pick DeSean Jackson had a great preseason and was named as a Week starter for the Eagles at receiver
Quarterback Donovan McNabb also had a strong preseason and finally looked fully recovered from his knee surgery
The rebuilt special teams unit impressed in the preseason with draft picks Jackson and Quintin Demps returning a punt and a kick respectively for touchdowns in an exhibition win over the Patriots
The offense went into the season with Westbrook in his prime and a seemingly rejuvenated McNabb but the receiving corps looked feeble and the offensive line looked uncertain with the aging tackles Jon Runyan and Tra Thomas anchoring the unit and Shawn Andrews not playing until the middle of the preseason
The defense featured the deepest secondary in the NFL with Samuel Brown Sheppard and veteran safety Brian Dawkins
The linebacking corps looked young and quick and Trent Cole was the clear star on the defensive line
Possibly the most key improvement in the team over lies in the special teams which was a consistent weakness the previous season
