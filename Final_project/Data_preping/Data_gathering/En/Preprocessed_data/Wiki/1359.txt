Shrewsbury (/ˈʃruzberi/ SHROOZ-bury) is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States
Shrewsbury, unlike the surrounding towns of Grafton, Millbury, Westborough,  Northborough, Boylston, and West Boylston did not become a mill town or farming village; most of its 19th-century growth was due to its proximity to Worcester and visitors to Lake Quinsigamond
The population was 38,325 according to the 2020 United States Census, in nearly 15,000 households.
Incorporated in 1727, the town is governed now under the New England representative town meeting system, headed by the Town Manager and five-member elected Board of Selectmen whose duties include licensing, appointing various administrative positions, and calling a town meeting of citizens annually or whenever the need arises.
The Town of Shrewsbury, named for Shrewsbury, England, is a suburban community with an uneven and hilly terrain cut by a number of minor streams providing several small water power sites
Grants of land were made in what would eventually be the town beginning in 1664, with the 3,200-acre (13 km) grant called Haynes Farm as the largest
In 1664 Native American leader, Peter Jethro, and other Nipmuc Indians deeded land around Lake Quinsigamond to settlers in the area
Settlers came primarily from Sudbury and Marlborough, and the first permanent settler was Gersham Wheelock in 1720
As a town, Shrewsbury was first settled in 1722 and officially incorporated in 1727.
Townspeople created an agricultural economy with apple orchards, and by 1750, there were two stores and four taverns as well as several small industries in operation
The rapid fall of prices for agricultural goods, the shortage of hard currency, and the general economic depression following the Revolutionary War produced disastrous conditions for colonists
Shays' Rebellion in 1786 sought to close the courts to prevent debt collections and the foreclosure of mortgages
Shrewsbury became a staging area for the rebellion and the encampment of the more than 400 insurgents, before the march on the Worcester Court House.
A leather industry began in 1786 in Shrewsbury, and town farmers developed large cattle herds to support the manufacture of boots and shoes
This was followed by the establishment of gunsmithing operations in 1797, which produced rifles, shotguns and pistols and eventually cutlery
Luther Goddard began in 1809 by making brass clocks and then established a small watch factory employing a few skilled Swiss and English watchmakers
Lumbering created sawmills, and they in turn drew chair and cabinet makers, plow and wagon builders.
The development of streetcar routes in the 19th century propelled the growth of single-family housing in town
A summer resort population on Lake Quinsigamond became consumers of the market garden produce grown by town farmers
As Shrewsbury's industry was killed by the lack of large waterpower sites and the tardy arrival of the railroad, its role as a suburb of Worcester grew more important
The town's population doubled from 1915 to 1940 as continued streetcar suburb growth brought more modern settlers into the community
Other modern developments included an increased number of lakeside cottages, ethnic clubs and recreational areas on the lake.
The 1953 Worcester tornado came through the Shrewsbury area, killing twelve people and causing extensive damage.
Shrewsbury is home to three current and one former Nationally Registered Historic Places:
The Gen
Artemas Ward Homestead on Main Street
The Shrewsbury Historic District, in the town center which includes parts of Church Road, Main Street, Prospect Street, Boylston Street, and Grafton Street
1767 Milestones, of which two surviving milestones are in town, along the route of the old Boston Post Road.Shrewsbury is a suburb of Worcester, and about 40 miles from Boston
The town has a total area of 21.6 square miles (56 km), of which 20.7 square miles (54 km) of it is land and 0.9 sq mi (2.3 km) of it (4.25%) is water
The town is home to Busta Rhymes Island.

These schools are Beal Early Childhood Center (preschool to 1st grade), Major Howard W
Beal School (grades 1–4), Floral Street School (grades 1–4), Spring Street School (grades 1–4), Walter J
Paton Elementary School (grades 2–4), Calvin Coolidge Elementary School (grades 1–4), Sherwood Middle School (grades 5–6), Oak Middle School (grades 7–8), and the Shrewsbury High School.

The Shrewsbury Public Library was established in 1872
In fiscal year 2008, the town of Shrewsbury spent 1.4% ($1,164,563) of its budget on its public library—about $34 per town resident, per year ($44.80 adjusted for inflation to 2022)
Following the 1978 library expansion project, another expansion was needed
In 2004 and 2010, officials completed research showing inadequate space, poorly maintained roofs and heating/cooling systems, lack of handicap accessibility, and a growing demand for library services
In 2010, a project was proposed that would create a new 42,000-square-foot (3,900 m) facility for a total of approximately $19 million
The main library closed to enable construction of the new building and opened in temporary accommodation at 214 Lake Street on 26 October 2014
As of June 15, 2016, construction on the expansion project was substantially complete and work on punch list items was ongoing.
The new library celebrated its grand opening with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on September 21, 2016.
