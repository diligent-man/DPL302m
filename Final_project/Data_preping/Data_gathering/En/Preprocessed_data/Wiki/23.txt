The Temple of Zeus at Olympia was an ancient Greek temple in Olympia Greece dedicated to the god Zeus
The temple built in the second quarter of the fifth century BC was the very model of the fully developed classical Greek temple of the Doric order
The Temple of Zeus was built on an already ancient religious site at Olympia
The Altis an enclosure with a sacred grove open-air altars and the tumulus of Pelops was first formed during the tenth and ninth centuries BC Greece's Dark Age when the followers of Zeus had joined with the followers of Hera
The temple was of peripteral form with a frontal pronaos porch mirrored by a similar arrangement at the back of the building the opisthodomos
The building sat on a crepidoma platform of three unequal steps the exterior columns were positioned in a six by thirteen arrangement two rows of seven columns divided the cella inner chamber into three aisles
An echo of the temple's original appearance can be seen in the Second Temple of Hera at Paestum which closely followed its form
Pausanias visited the site in the second century AD and states that the temple's height up to the pediment was feet m its breadth was feet m and its length feet m
It was approached by a ramp on the east side
Because the main structure was of a local limestone that was unattractive and of poor quality it was coated with a thin layer of stucco to give the appearance of marble so as to match the sculptural decoration
It was roofed with tiles of Pentelic marble cut thin enough to be translucent so that on a summer's day light comparable to a conventional -watt bulb would have shone through each of the tiles
From the edge of the roof projected waterspouts or gargoyles in the shape of lion heads of which are extant
Incongruities in the styles of the spouts provide evidence that the roof was repaired during the Roman period
The sculptural decoration in imported Parian marble featured carved metopes and triglyph friezes topped by pediments filled with sculptures in the Severe style now attributed to the Olympia Master and his studio
The Eastern pediment depicts the chariot race between Pelops and Oenomaus while the Western pediment features a Centauromachy with Theseus and the Lapiths
The god Apollo is featured on the western pediment pointing towards the human side in the Centauromachy indicating his favor and towards the northern side of the temple
Pausanias reports in his Description of Greece that the Eastern pedimental sculpture was created by Paeonius and the Western sculpture was carved by Alcamenes
The metopes from the temple depict the twelve labours of Heracles
The temple housed the renowned statue of Zeus which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World
The Chryselephantine gold and ivory statue was approximately m ft high and was made by the sculptor Phidias in his workshop on the site at Olympia
The statue's completion took approximately years BC and was one of Classical Greece's most revered artistic works
The installation of the colossal statue coincided with substantial modification of the cella
The internal columns and their stylobates were dismantled and repositioned which likely necessitated retiling the roof
The original floor paved with large blocks of shell stone was covered with water-resistant lime which may have helped protect the statue's ivory against humidity
The Roman general Mummius dedicated twenty-one gilded shields after he sacked Corinth in BC they were fixed at the metopes of the eastern front side and the eastern half of the south side
In AD Theodosius II ordered the destruction of the sanctuary during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire
Archaeologists have long postulated that the already ruined Temple was destroyed by the earthquakes of AD and known to have caused widespread damage in the Peloponnese although a paper hypothesizes that the columns may have been intentionally pulled down by ropes during the early Byzantine period
Flooding of the Kladeos river Foundoulis et al or by tsunami Vott et al led to abandonment of the area in the th century
Eventually the site was covered by alluvial deposits of up to meters deep
The site of the ancient sanctuary of Olympia long forgotten under landslips and flood siltation was identified in by the English antiquarian Richard Chandler
In May the French team of archaeologists of the Scientific Expedition of Morea under the direction of Lon-Jean-Joseph Dubois and Abel Blouet identified with certainty and partially excavated the Temple of Zeus for the first time taking several fragments of the metopes to the Muse du Louvre with the authorization of the Governor of Greece Ioannis Kapodistrias
Systematic excavation began in under the direction of the German Archaeological Institute and has continued with some interruptions to the present time
