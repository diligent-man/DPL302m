NiemannPick disease is a group of severe inherited metabolic disorders in which sphingomyelin accumulates in lysosomes in cells the lysosomes normally degrade material that comes from out of cells
These disorders involve the dysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids which are fats found in cell membranes so it is a kind of sphingolipidosis which is included in the larger family of lysosomal storage diseases
Symptoms are related to the organs in which sphingomyelin accumulates
Enlargement of the liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly may cause reduced appetite abdominal distension and pain
Enlargement of the spleen splenomegaly may also cause low levels of platelets in the blood thrombocytopenia
Accumulation of sphingomyelin in the central nervous system including the cerebellum results in unsteady gait ataxia slurring of speech dysarthria and difficulty swallowing dysphagia
Basal ganglia dysfunction causes abnormal posturing of the limbs trunk and face dystonia
Upper brainstem disease results in impaired voluntary rapid eye movements supranuclear gaze palsy
More widespread disease involving the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures causes gradual loss of intellectual abilities causing dementia and seizures
Bones also may be affected with the disease causing enlarged bone marrow cavities thinned cortical bone or a distortion of the hip bone called coxa vara
Sleep-related disorders also occur with the condition such as sleep inversion sleepiness during the day and wakefulness at night
Gelastic cataplexy the sudden loss of muscle tone when the affected patient laughs is also seen
Mutations in the SMPD gene cause NiemannPick disease types A and B
They produce a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase that breaks down the lipid sphingomyelin
Mutations in NPC or NPC cause NiemannPick disease type C NPC which affects a protein used to transport lipids
Type D originally was separated from type C to delineate a group of patients with otherwise identical disorders who shared a common Nova Scotian ancestry
Patients in this group are known to share a specific mutation in the NPC gene so NPC is used for both groups
Before the molecular defects were described the terms NiemannPick type I and NiemannPick type II were proposed to separate the high- and low-sphingomyelin forms of the disease in the early s
NiemannPick disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies or both alleles of the gene must be defective to cause the disease
Defective means they are altered in a way that impairs their function
Most often the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers they have one copy of the altered gene but are not affected because the other copy produces the enzyme
If both parents are carriers each pregnancy has a chance of producing an affected child
Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who may be carriers of the disease
NiemannPick diseases are a subgroup of lipid storage disorders called sphingolipidoses in which harmful quantities of fatty substances or lipids accumulate in the spleen liver lungs bone marrow and brain
In the classic infantile type-A variant a missense mutation causes complete deficiency of sphingomyelinase
Sphingomyelin is a component of cell membrane including the organellar membrane so the enzyme deficiency blocks degradation of lipid resulting in the accumulation of sphingomyelin within lysosomes in the macrophage-monocyte phagocyte lineage
Affected cells become enlarged sometimes up to μm in diameter secondary to the distention of lysosomes with sphingomyelin and cholesterol
Histology shows lipid-laden macrophages in the marrow and sea-blue histiocytes on pathology
Numerous small vacuoles of relatively uniform size are created giving the cytoplasm a foamy appearance
For type A and B levels of sphingomylinase can be measured from a blood sample
To diagnose type C a skin sample can help determine whether the transporter is affected via the Filipin test which detects build-up of unesterified cholesterol via fluorescent staining
There are four types of NiemannPick disease in two categories
Patients with ASM deficiency are classified into type A and B
Type A patients exhibit hepatosplenomegaly in infancy and profound central nervous system involvement and unable to survive beyond two years of age
Type B patients also show hepatosplenomegaly and pathologic alterations of their lungs but usually without the involvement of their central nervous system
Some can develop significant life-threatening complications including liver failure hemorrhage oxygen dependency pulmonary infections and splenic rupture
Some develop coronary artery or valvular heart disease
In a longitudinal natural history study nearly of the patients died
For those classified into type C they may have mild hepatosplenomegaly but their central nervous system is profoundly affected
NiemannPick disease SMPD-associated which includes types A and BNiemannPick disease type A classic infantile
NiemannPick disease type B visceralNiemannPick disease type C subacutejuvenile includes types C of type C and C
Type C is the most common form of the disease Type C is a rare form of the diseaseNiemannPick disease type D or Nova Scotia form is now believed to be the same condition as NiemannPick disease type C
Two poorly characterized forms of NiemannPick disease have also been described as types E and F
No specific treatment is known for type A but symptoms are treated
In adult patients with type B physicians try to keep cholesterol levels down to normal levels
If statins are used they monitor liver function
If the spleen is enlarged and platelet levels low acute episodes of bleeding may require transfusions of blood products
If they have symptoms of interstitial lung disease they may need oxygen
Anecdotally organ transplant has been attempted with limited success
Future prospects include enzyme replacement and gene therapy
Bone marrow transplant has been tried for type B
In January Actelion announced the drug miglustat Zavesca had been approved in the European Union for the treatment of progressive neurological manifestations in adult patients and pediatric patients with NPC
The drug is available to patients in the United States on an experimental basis
In March the FDA requested additional preclinical and clinical information regarding Zavesca from Actelion before making a final decision on approving the drug in the United States for NPC
Olipudase alfa Xenpozyme was approved for medical use in Japan in March
Highly variable infantile neurovisceral Niemann Pick disease Type A ASMD is usually fatal before years of age
In Type B ASMD mortality before adulthood is common
But many patients live well into adulthood and may reach a normal lifespan
Diagnoses have been made in the th decade of life
Type C is an entirely different disorder which also has a highly variable prognosis
The incidence among Ashkenazi Jews is estimated to be about one in for type A of NiemannPick disease
The incidence of both NiemannPick disease types A and B in all other populations is estimated to be one in
The incidence of NiemannPick disease type C is estimated to be one in
Albert Niemann published the first description of what now is known as NiemannPick disease type A in
Ludwig Pick described the pathology of the disease in a series of papers in the s
In the classification of NiemannPick disease into types A B and C was introduced and also contained a type D called the Nova Scotian type
Genetic studies showed that type D is caused by the same gene as type C and the type D designation is no longer used
Research has been ongoing to better understand the disease and treatments for it
The loss of myelin in the central nervous system is considered to be a main pathogenic factor
Research uses animal models carrying the underlying mutation for NiemannPick disease eg
a mutation in the NPC gene as seen in Niemann-Pick type C disease
In this model the expression of myelin gene regulatory factor MRF has been shown to be significantly decreased
MRF is a transcription factor of critical importance in the development and maintenance of myelin sheaths
A perturbation of oligodendrocyte maturation and the myelination process might therefore be an underlying mechanism of the neurological deficits
Curiously in fibroblast cells derived from patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease were shown to be resistant to Ebola virus because of mutations in the NPC protein which is needed for viral escape from the vesicular compartment
Other studies have uncovered small molecules which inhibit the receptor and may be a potential therapeutic strategy
In the European Medicines Agency EMA granted orphan drug designation to arimoclomol for the treatment of Niemann-Pick type C
This was followed in by the US
Dosing in a placebo-controlled phase IIIII clinical trial to investigate treatment for Niemann-Pick type C for patients with both type C and C using arimoclomol began in
Researchers at the University of Arizona first proposed the use of -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrins for the treatment of Niemann-Pick Type C in
Researchers noted that HPBCDs with varying levels of -hydroxypropyl substitution had effects in delaying neurological symptoms and in decreasing liver cholesterol storage in a Niemann-Pick mouse model
Later researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center found that when NiemannPick type C mice were injected with -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin HPbCD when they were days old they showed marked improvement in liver function much less neurodegeneration and ultimately they lived longer lives than the mice who did not receive this treatment
These results suggest HPbCD acutely reverses the storage defect seen in NPC
National Institutes of Health NIH in collaboration with the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases Program TRND announced they were developing a clinical trial using HPbCD for NiemannPick type C patients
A clinical trial conducted by Vtesse LLC began in January and was completed in March
On April the European Medicines Agency granted International Niemann-Pick Disease Alliance INPDA the United Kingdom orphan designation for HPbCD for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C
Gene therapy is being used clinically to treat genetic diseases including haemophilia and spinal muscular atrophy
It has been used preclinically in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick type C using an adeno-associated virus derived viral vector has been shown to extend lifespan following injection into the lateral ventricles of the neonatal brain
In a separate proof-of-concept study a similar vector but with a modified capsid was injected intravenously into Niemann-Pick type C mice at around four weeks of age this resulted in extended lifespan and improved weight gain
Gene therapy has also been used preclinically in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick type A
Injection into the Cisterna magna at weeks of age prevented motor and memory impairment and neuronal cell death
