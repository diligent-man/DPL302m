chulalongkorn thai september october was the fifth monarch of siam under the house of chakri titled rama v
he was known to the siamese of his time as phra phuttha chao luang the royal buddha
chulalongkorn s reign was characterised by the modernisation of siam governmental and social reforms and territorial concessions to the british and french
as siam was surrounded by european colonies chulalongkorn through his policies and acts ensured the independence of siam
all his reforms were dedicated to ensuring siam s independence given the increasing encroachment of western powers so that chulalongkorn earned the epithet phra piya maharat the great beloved king
king chulalongkorn was born on september to king mongkut and queen debsirindra and given the name chulalongkorn
in he was designated krommamuen pikhanesuan surasangkat
his father gave him a broad education including instruction from western tutors such as anna leonowens
in he became a novice monk for six months at wat bawonniwet according to royal tradition
upon his return to his secular life in he was designated krommakhun phinit prachanat
in king mongkut led an expedition to the malay peninsula south of the city of hua hin to verify his calculations of the solar eclipse of august
both father and son fell ill of malaria
mongkut died on october
assuming the year old chulalongkorn to be dying as well king mongkut on his deathbed wrote my brother my son my grandson whoever you all the senior officials think will be able to save our country will succeed my throne choose at your own will si suriyawongse the most powerful government official of the day managed the succession of chulalongkorn to the throne and his own appointment as regent
the first coronation was held on november
chulalongkorn s health improved and he was tutored in public affairs
the young chulalongkorn was an enthusiastic reformer
he visited singapore and java in and british india in to study the administration of british colonies
he toured the administrative centres of calcutta delhi bombay and back to calcutta in early
this journey was a source of his later ideas for the modernization of siam
he was crowned king in his own right as rama v on november
si suriyawongse then arranged for the front palace of king pinklao who was his uncle to be bequeathed to king pinklao s son prince yingyot who was chulalongkorn s cousin
as regent si suriyawongse wielded great influence
si suriyawongse continued the works of king mongkut
he supervised the digging of several important khlongs such as padung krungkasem and damneun saduak and the paving of roads such as charoen krung and silom
he was also a patron of thai literature and performing arts
at the end of his regency si suriyawonse was raised to somdet chao phraya the highest title a noble could attain
si suriyawongse was the most powerful noble of the th century
his family the house of bunnag was a powerful aristocratic dynasty of persian descent
it dominated siamese politics since the reign of rama i
chulalongkorn then married four of his half sisters all daughters of mongkut savang vadhana saovabha and sunandha mongkut with concubine piam and sukumalmarsri monkut with concubine samli
chulalongkorn s first reform was to establish the auditory office th on june solely responsible for tax collection to counter the influence of the bunnag family whom had been in control of weath collection since early rattanakosin
one of the purposes was as tax collectors had been under the aegis of various nobles and thus a source of their wealth this reform caused great consternation among the nobility especially the front palace
chulalongkorn appointed chaturonrasmi to be an executive of the organization with he closely oversaw it
from the time of king mongkut the front palace had been the equivalent of a second king with one third of national revenue allocated to it
prince yingyot of the front palace was known to be on friendly terms with many britons at a time when siamese relations with the british empire were tense
in chulalongkorn established the council of state as a legislative body and a privy council as his personal advisory board based on the british privy council
council members were appointed by the monarch
on the night of december a fire broke out near the gunpowder storehouse and gasworks in the main palace
front palace troops quickly arrived fully armed to assist in putting out the fire
they were denied entrance and the fire was extinguished
the incident demonstrated the considerable power wielded by aristocrats and royal relatives leaving the king little power
reducing the power held by the nobility became one of his main motives in reforming siam s feudal politics
when prince yingyot died in chulalongkorn took the opportunity to abolish the titular front palace and created the title of crown prince of siam in line with western custom
chulalongkorn s son prince vajirunhis was appointed the first crown prince of siam though he never reigned
in when the prince died of typhoid at age he was succeeded by his half brother vajiravudh who was then at boarding school in england
in the northern laotian lands bordering china the insurgents of the taiping rebellion had taken refuge since the reign of king mongkut
these chinese were called haw and became bandits pillaging the villages
in chulalongkorn sent troops from bangkok to crush the haw who had ravaged as far as vientiane
however they met strong chinese resistance and retreated to isan in
new modernized forces were sent again and were divided into two groups approaching the haw from chiang kam and pichai
the haw scattered and some fled to vietnam
the siamese armies proceeded to eliminate the remaining haw
the city of nong khai maintains memorials for the siamese dead
in burma while the british army fought the burmese konbaung dynasty siam remained neutral
britain had agreements with the siamese government which stated that if the british were in conflict with burma siam would send food supplies to the british army
chulalongkorn honored the agreement
the british expected he would send an army to help defeat the burmese but he did not do so
freed of the front palace and chinese rebellions chulalongkorn initiated modernization and centralization reforms
he established the royal military academy in to train officers in western fashion
his upgraded forces provided the king much more power to centralize the country
the government of siam had remained largely unchanged since the th century
the central government was headed by the samuha nayok i e prime minister who controlled the northern parts of siam and the samuha kalahom i e grand commander who controlled southern siam in both civil and military affairs
the samuha nayok presided over the chatu sadombh i e four pillars
the responsibilities of each pillar overlapped and were ambiguous
in chulalongkorn moved to institute a government of ministries
ministers were at the outset members of the royal family
ministries were established in with all ministries having equal status
the council of state proved unable to veto legal drafts or to give chulalongkorn advice because the members regarded chulalongkorn as an absolute monarch far above their station
chulalongkorn dissolved the council altogether and transferred advisory duties to the cabinet in
chulalongkorn abolished the traditional nakorn bala methods of torture in the judiciary process which were seen as inhumane and barbaric to western eyes and introduced a western judicial code
his belgian advisor rolin jaequemyns played a great role in the development of modern siamese law and its judicial system
chulalongkorn was the first siamese king to send royal princes to europe to be educated
in th century europe nationalism flourished and there were calls for more liberty
the princes were influenced by the liberal notions of democracy and elections they encountered in republics like france and constitutional monarchies like the united kingdom
in year of the rattakosin era siamese officials in europe warned chulalongkorn of possible threats to siamese independence from the european powers
they advised that siam should be reformed like meiji japan and that siam should become a constitutional monarchy
chulalongkorn demurred stating that the time was not ripe and that he himself was making reforms
throughout chulalongkorn s reign writers with radical ideas had their works published for the first time
the most notable ones included thianwan wannapho who had been imprisoned for years and from prison produced many works criticizing traditional siamese society
in king norodom of cambodia was forced to put his country under french protection
the cession of cambodia was officially formulated in
however inner cambodia as called in siam consisting of battambang siem reap and srisopon remained a siamese possession
this was the first of many territorial cessions
in french indochina was formed from vietnam and cambodia
in french troops invaded northern laos to subjugate the heo insurgents
however the french troops never left and the french demanded more laotian lands
in auguste pavie the french vice consul of luang prabang requested the cession of all laotian lands east of the mekong river
siam resented the demand leading to the franco siamese war of
the french gunboat le lutin entered the chao phraya and anchored near the french consulate ready to attack
fighting was observed in laos
inconstant and comete were attacked in chao phraya and the french sent an ultimatum an indemnity of three million francs as well as the cession of and withdrawal from laos
siam did not accept the ultimatum
french troops then blockaded the gulf of siam and occupied chantaburi and trat
chulalongkorn sent rolin jacquemyns to negotiate
the issue was eventually settled with the cession of laos in but the french troops in chantaburi and trat refused to leave
the cession of vast laotian lands had a major impact on chulalongkorn s spirit
prince vajirunhis died in
prince vajiravudh was created crown prince to replace him
chulalongkorn realised the importance of maintaining the navy and established the royal thai naval academy in
despite siamese concessions french armies continued the occupation of chantaburi and trat for another years
an agreement was reached in that french troops would leave chantaburi but hold the coast land from trat to koh kong
in the final agreement was reached
trat was returned to siam but the french kept koh kong and received inner cambodia
seeing the seriousness of foreign affairs chulalongkorn visited europe in
he was the first siamese monarch to do so and he desired european recognition of siam as a fully independent power
he appointed his queen saovabha phongsri as regent in siam during his travel to europe
during a visit to spain and portugal on october he condemned and ordered his servant to be executed for a breach of etiquette committed in lisbon according to the telegram news from saragossa
siam had been composed of a network of cities according to the mandala system codified by king trailokanat in with local rulers owing tribute to bangkok
each city retained a substantial degree of autonomy as siam was not a state but a network of city states
with the rise of european colonialism the western concept of state and territorial division was introduced
it had to define explicitly which lands were siamese and which lands were foreign
the conflict with the french in was an example
sukhaphiban sanitary districts were the first sub autonomous entities established in thailand
the first such was created in bangkok by royal decree of king chulalongkorn in
during his european tour earlier that year he had learned about the sanitary districts of england and wanted to try out this local administrative unit in his capital
with his experiences during the travel to british colonies and the suggestion of prince damrong chulalongkorn established the hierarchical system of monthons in composed of province city amphoe tambon and muban village in descending order
though an entire monthon the eastern province inner cambodia was ceded to the french in
each monthon was overseen by an intendant of the ministry of interior
this had a major impact as it ended the power of all local dynasties
central authority now spread all over the country through the administration of intendants
for example the lanna states in the north including the kingdom of chiangmai principalities of lampang lamphun nan and prae tributaries to bangkok were made into two monthons neglecting the existence of the lanna kings
local rulers did not cede power willingly
three rebellions sprang up in the ngeaw rebellion in phrae the holy man s rebellion in isan and the rebellion of seven sultans in the south
all these rebellions were crushed in with the city rulers stripped of their power and imprisoned
ayutthaya king ramathibodi ii established a system of corv e in after which the lives of siamese commoners and slaves were closely regulated by the government
all siamese common men phrai were subject to the siamese corv e system
each man at the time of his majority had to register with a government bureau department or leading member of the royalty called krom as a phrai luang or under a nobleman s dominion moon nai or chao khun moon nai as a phrai som
phrai owed service to sovereign or master for three months of the year
phrai suay were those who could make payment in kind cattle in lieu of service
those conscripted into military service were called phrai tahan
chulalongkorn was best known for his abolition of siamese slavery he associated the abolition of slavery in the united states with the bloodshed of the american civil war
chulalongkorn to prevent such a bloodbath in siam provided several steps towards the abolition of slavery not an extreme turning point from servitude to total freedom
those who found themselves unable to live on their own sold themselves into slavery by rich noblemen
likewise when a debt was defaulted the borrower would become a slave of the lender
if the debt was redeemed the slave regained freedom
however those whose parents were household slaves were bound to be slaves forever because their redemption price was extremely high
because of economic conditions people sold themselves into slavery in great numbers and in turn they produced a large number of household slaves
in they accounted for one third of siamese population
in chulalongkorn enacted a law that lowered the redemption price of household slaves born in his ascension year and freed all of them when they had reached
the newly freed slaves would have time to settle themselves as farmers or merchants so they would not become unemployed
in the slave abolition act ended siamese slavery in all forms
the reverse of baht banknotes in circulation since the centennial depict chulalongkorn in navy uniform abolishing the slave tradition
the traditional corv e system declined after the bowring treaty which gave rise to a new class of employed labourers not regulated by the government while many noblemen continued to hold sway over large numbers of phrai som
chulalongkorn needed more effective control of manpower to undo the power of nobility
after the establishment of the monthon system chulalongkorn instituted a census to count all men available to the government
the employment act of required that all workers be paid not forced to work
chulalongkorn had established a defence ministry in
the ending of the corv e system necessitated the beginning of military conscription thus the conscription act of in siam
this was followed in by the first act providing for invoking martial law which seven years later was changed to its modern form by his son and successor king vajiravudh
the royal thai survey department a special services group of the royal thai armed forces engaged in cadastral survey which is the survey of specific land parcels to define ownership for land registration and for equitable taxation
land title deeds are issued using the torrens title system though it was not until the year that the first fruits of this survey were obtained
in the royal siamese government gazette published an announcement on the abolition of prostration
in it king chulalongkorn declared the practice of prostration in siam is severely oppressive
the subordinates have been forced to prostrate in order to elevate the dignity of the phu yai
i do not see how the practice of prostration will render any benefit to siam
the subordinates find the performance of prostration a harsh physical practice
they have to go down on their knees for a long time until their business with the phu yai ends
they will then be allowed to stand up and retreat
this kind of practice is the source of oppression
therefore i want to abolish it the gazette directed that from now on siamese are permitted to stand up before the dignitaries
to display an act of respect the siamese may take a bow instead
taking a bow will be regarded as a new form of paying respect
