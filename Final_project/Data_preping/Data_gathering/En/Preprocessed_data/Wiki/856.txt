pentecostalism or classical pentecostalism is a protestant charismatic christian movement that emphasizes direct personal experience of god through baptism with the holy spirit
the term pentecostal is derived from pentecost an event that commemorates the descent of the holy spirit upon the followers of jesus christ and the speaking in foreign tongues as described in the second chapter of the acts of the apostles
in greek it is the name for the jewish feast of weeks
like other forms of evangelical protestantism pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the bible and the necessity of the new birth an individual repenting of their sin and accepting jesus christ as personal lord and savior
it is distinguished by belief in the baptism in the holy spirit that enables a christian to live a spirit filled and empowered life
this empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing two other defining characteristics of pentecostalism
because of their commitment to biblical authority spiritual gifts and the miraculous pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the apostolic age of the early church
for this reason some pentecostals also use the term apostolic or full gospel to describe their movement
holiness pentecostalism emerged in the early th century among radical adherents of the wesleyan holiness movement who were energized by revivalism and expectation for the imminent second coming of christ
believing that they were living in the end times they expected god to spiritually renew the christian church and bring to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world
in charles parham an american evangelist and faith healer began teaching that speaking in tongues was the bible evidence of spirit baptism
along with william j
seymour a wesleyan holiness preacher he taught that this was the third work of grace
the three year long azusa street revival founded and led by seymour in los angeles california resulted in the growth of pentecostalism throughout the united states and the rest of the world
visitors carried the pentecostal experience back to their home churches or felt called to the mission field
while virtually all pentecostal denominations trace their origins to azusa street the movement has had several divisions and controversies
early disputes centered on challenges to the doctrine of entire sanctification as well as that of the trinity
as a result the pentecostal movement is divided between holiness pentecostals who affirm the second work of grace and finished work pentecostals who are partitioned into trinitarian and non trinitarian branches the latter giving rise to oneness pentecostalism
comprising over denominations and many independent churches pentecostalism is highly decentralized
no central authority exists but many denominations are affiliated with the pentecostal world fellowship
with over million classical pentecostals worldwide the movement is growing in many parts of the world especially the global south
since the s pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other christian traditions and pentecostal beliefs concerning spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non pentecostal christians in protestant and catholic churches through the charismatic movement
together worldwide pentecostal and charismatic christianity numbers over million adherents
while the movement originally attracted mostly lower classes in the global south there is a new appeal to middle classes
middle class congregations tend to have fewer members
according to various scholars and sources pentecostalism is the fastest growing religious movement in the world this growth is primarily due to religious conversion to pentecostalism
early pentecostals have considered the movement a latter day restoration of the church s apostolic power and historians such as cecil m
robeck jr
and edith blumhofer write that the movement emerged from late th century radical evangelical revival movements in america and in great britain
within this radical evangelicalism expressed most strongly in the wesleyan holiness and higher life movements themes of restorationism premillennialism faith healing and greater attention on the person and work of the holy spirit were central to emerging pentecostalism
believing that the second coming of christ was imminent these christians expected an endtime revival of apostolic power spiritual gifts and miracle working
figures such as dwight l
moody and r
torrey began to speak of an experience available to all christians which would empower believers to evangelize the world often termed baptism with the holy spirit
certain christian leaders and movements had important influences on early pentecostals
the essentially universal belief in the continuation of all the spiritual gifts in the keswick and higher life movements constituted a crucial historical background for the rise of pentecostalism
albert benjamin simpson and his christian and missionary alliance founded in was very influential in the early years of pentecostalism especially on the development of the assemblies of god
another early influence on pentecostals was john alexander dowie and his christian catholic apostolic church founded in
pentecostals embraced the teachings of simpson dowie adoniram judson gordon and maria woodworth etter she later joined the pentecostal movement on healing
edward irving s catholic apostolic church founded c
also displayed many characteristics later found in the pentecostal revival
isolated christian groups were experiencing charismatic phenomena such as divine healing and speaking in tongues
the holiness movement provided a theological explanation for what was happening to these christians and they adapted wesleyan soteriology to accommodate their new understanding
charles fox parham an independent holiness evangelist who believed strongly in divine healing was an important figure to the emergence of pentecostalism as a distinct christian movement
in he started a school near topeka kansas which he named bethel bible school
there he taught that speaking in tongues was the scriptural evidence for the reception of the baptism with the holy spirit
on january after a watch night service the students prayed for and received the baptism with the holy spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues
parham received this same experience sometime later and began preaching it in all his services
parham believed this was xenoglossia and that missionaries would no longer need to study foreign languages
after parham closed his topeka school and began a four year revival tour throughout kansas and missouri
he taught that the baptism with the holy spirit was a third experience subsequent to conversion and sanctification
sanctification cleansed the believer but spirit baptism empowered for service
at about the same time that parham was spreading his doctrine of initial evidence in the midwestern united states news of the welsh revival of ignited intense speculation among radical evangelicals around the world and particularly in the us of a coming move of the spirit which would renew the entire christian church
this revival saw thousands of conversions and also exhibited speaking in tongues
in parham moved to houston texas where he started a bible training school
one of his students was william j
seymour a one eyed black preacher
seymour traveled to los angeles where his preaching sparked the three year long azusa street revival in
the revival first broke out on monday april at bonnie brae street and then moved to azusa street on friday april
worship at the racially integrated azusa mission featured an absence of any order of service
people preached and testified as moved by the spirit spoke and sung in tongues and fell in the spirit
the revival attracted both religious and secular media attention and thousands of visitors flocked to the mission carrying the fire back to their home churches
despite the work of various wesleyan groups such as parham s and d
moody s revivals the beginning of the widespread pentecostal movement in the us is generally considered to have begun with seymour s azusa street revival
the crowds of african americans and whites worshiping together at william seymour s azusa street mission set the tone for much of the early pentecostal movement
during the period of pentecostals defied social cultural and political norms of the time that called for racial segregation and the enactment of jim crow laws
the church of god in christ the church of god cleveland the pentecostal holiness church and the pentecostal assemblies of the world were all interracial denominations before the s
these groups especially in the jim crow south were under great pressure to conform to segregation
ultimately north american pentecostalism would divide into white and african american branches
though it never entirely disappeared interracial worship within pentecostalism would not reemerge as a widespread practice until after the civil rights movement
women were vital to the early pentecostal movement
believing that whoever received the pentecostal experience had the responsibility to use it towards the preparation for christ s second coming pentecostal women held that the baptism in the holy spirit gave them empowerment and justification to engage in activities traditionally denied to them
the first person at parham s bible college to receive spirit baptism with the evidence of speaking in tongues was a woman agnes ozman
women such as florence crawford ida robinson and aimee semple mcpherson founded new denominations and many women served as pastors co pastors and missionaries
women wrote religious songs edited pentecostal papers and taught and ran bible schools
the unconventionally intense and emotional environment generated in pentecostal meetings dually promoted and was itself created by other forms of participation such as personal testimony and spontaneous prayer and singing
women did not shy away from engaging in this forum and in the early movement the majority of converts and church goers were female
nevertheless there was considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of women in the church
the subsiding of the early pentecostal movement allowed a socially more conservative approach to women to settle in and as a result female participation was channeled into more supportive and traditionally accepted roles
auxiliary women s organizations were created to focus women s talents on more traditional activities
women also became much more likely to be evangelists and missionaries than pastors
when they were pastors they often co pastored with their husbands
the majority of early pentecostal denominations taught christian pacifism and adopted military service articles that advocated conscientious objection
azusa participants returned to their homes carrying their new experience with them
in many cases whole churches were converted to the pentecostal faith but many times pentecostals were forced to establish new religious communities when their experience was rejected by the established churches
one of the first areas of involvement was the african continent where by american missionaries were established in liberia as well as in south africa by
because speaking in tongues was initially believed to always be actual foreign languages it was believed that missionaries would no longer have to learn the languages of the peoples they evangelized because the holy spirit would provide whatever foreign language was required
when the majority of missionaries to their disappointment learned that tongues speech was unintelligible on the mission field pentecostal leaders were forced to modify their understanding of tongues thus as the experience of speaking in tongues spread a sense of the immediacy of christ s return took hold and that energy would be directed into missionary and evangelistic activity
early pentecostals saw themselves as outsiders from mainstream society dedicated solely to preparing the way for christ s return
an associate of seymour s florence crawford brought the message to the northwest forming what would become the apostolic faith church a holiness pentecostal denomination by
after azusa participant william howard durham pastor of the north avenue mission in chicago returned to the midwest to lay the groundwork for the movement in that region
it was from durham s church that future leaders of the pentecostal assemblies of canada would hear the pentecostal message
one of the most well known pentecostal pioneers was gaston b
cashwell the apostle of pentecost to the south whose evangelistic work led three southeastern holiness denominations into the new movement
the pentecostal movement especially in its early stages was typically associated with the impoverished and marginalized of america especially african americans and southern whites
with the help of many healing evangelists such as oral roberts pentecostalism spread across america by the s
international visitors and pentecostal missionaries would eventually export the revival to other nations
the first foreign pentecostal missionaries were a
garr and his wife who were spirit baptized at azusa and traveled to india and later hong kong
the norwegian methodist pastor t
barratt was influenced by seymour during a tour of the united states
by december he had returned to europe and is credited with beginning the pentecostal movement in sweden norway denmark germany france and england
a notable convert of barratt was alexander boddy the anglican vicar of all saints in sunderland england who became a founder of british pentecostalism
other important converts of barratt were german minister jonathan paul who founded the first german pentecostal denomination the m lheim association and lewi pethrus the swedish baptist minister who founded the swedish pentecostal movement
through durham s ministry italian immigrant luigi francescon received the pentecostal experience in and established italian pentecostal congregations in the us argentina christian assembly in argentina and brazil christian congregation of brazil
in giacomo lombardi led the first pentecostal services in italy
in november two swedish pentecostal missionaries arrived in belem brazil and established what would become the assembleias de deus assemblies of god of brazil
in john g
lake a follower of alexander dowie who had experienced pentecostal spirit baptism traveled to south africa and founded what would become the apostolic faith mission of south africa and the zion christian church
as a result of this missionary zeal practically all pentecostal denominations today trace their historical roots to the azusa street revival
the first generation of pentecostal believers faced immense criticism and ostracism from other christians most vehemently from the holiness movement from which they originated
alma white leader of the pillar of fire church a holiness methodist denomination wrote a book against the movement titled demons and tongues in
she called pentecostal tongues satanic gibberish and pentecostal services the climax of demon worship
famous holiness methodist preacher w
godbey characterized those at azusa street as satan s preachers jugglers necromancers enchanters magicians and all sorts of mendicants
to dr
campbell morgan pentecostalism was the last vomit of satan while dr
torrey thought it was emphatically not of god and founded by a sodomite
the pentecostal church of the nazarene one of the largest holiness groups was strongly opposed to the new pentecostal movement
to avoid confusion the church changed its name in to the church of the nazarene
simpson s christian and missionary alliance a keswickian denomination negotiated a compromise position unique for the time
simpson believed that pentecostal tongues speaking was a legitimate manifestation of the holy spirit but he did not believe it was a necessary evidence of spirit baptism
this view on speaking in tongues ultimately led to what became known as the alliance position articulated by a
tozer as seek not forbid not
the first pentecostal converts were mainly derived from the holiness movement and adhered to a wesleyan understanding of sanctification as a definite instantaneous experience and second work of grace
problems with this view arose when large numbers of converts entered the movement from non wesleyan backgrounds especially from baptist churches
in william durham of chicago first articulated the finished work a doctrine which located sanctification at the moment of salvation and held that after conversion the christian would progressively grow in grace in a lifelong process
this teaching polarized the pentecostal movement into two factions holiness pentecostalism and finished work pentecostalism
the wesleyan doctrine was strongest in the apostolic faith church which views itself as being the successor of the azusa street revival as well as in the church of god cleveland church of god in christ free gospel church and the pentecostal holiness church these bodies are classed as holiness pentecostal denominations
the finished work however would ultimately gain ascendancy among pentecostals in denominations such as the assemblies of god which was the first finished work pentecostal denomination
after most new pentecostal denominations would adhere to finished work sanctification
in a group of predominately white pentecostal ministers and laymen from all regions of the united states gathered in hot springs arkansas to create a new national pentecostal fellowship the general council of the assemblies of god
by many of these white ministers were distancing themselves from an existing arrangement under an african american leader
many of these white ministers were licensed by the african american c
mason under the auspices of the church of god in christ one of the few legally chartered pentecostal organizations at the time credentialing and licensing ordained pentecostal clergy
to further such distance bishop mason and other african american pentecostal leaders were not invited to the initial fellowship of pentecostal ministers
these predominately white ministers adopted a congregational polity whereas the cogic and other southern groups remained largely episcopal and rejected a finished work understanding of sanctification
thus the creation of the assemblies of god marked an official end of pentecostal doctrinal unity and racial integration
among these finished work pentecostals the new assemblies of god would soon face a new issue which first emerged at a camp meeting
during a baptism service the speaker r
mcalister mentioned that the apostles baptized converts once in the name of jesus christ and the words father son and holy ghost were never used in baptism
this inspired frank ewart who claimed to have received as a divine prophecy revealing a nontrinitarian conception of god
ewart believed that there was only one personality in the godhead jesus christ
the terms father and holy ghost were titles designating different aspects of christ
those who had been baptized in the trinitarian fashion needed to submit to rebaptism in jesus name
furthermore ewart believed that jesus name baptism and the gift of tongues were essential for salvation
ewart and those who adopted his belief which is known as oneness pentecostalism called themselves oneness or jesus name pentecostals but their opponents called them jesus only
amid great controversy the assemblies of god rejected the oneness teaching and many of its churches and pastors were forced to withdraw from the denomination in
they organized their own oneness groups
most of these joined garfield t
haywood an african american preacher from indianapolis to form the pentecostal assemblies of the world
this church maintained an interracial identity until when the white ministers withdrew to form the pentecostal church incorporated
this church later merged with another group forming the united pentecostal church international
this controversy among the finished work pentecostals caused holiness pentecostals to further distance themselves from finished work pentecostals who they viewed as heretical
while pentecostals shared many basic assumptions with conservative protestants the earliest pentecostals were rejected by fundamentalist christians who adhered to cessationism
in the world christian fundamentals association labeled pentecostalism fanatical and unscriptural
by the early s this rejection of pentecostals was giving way to a new cooperation between them and leaders of the new evangelicalism and american pentecostals were involved in the founding of the national association of evangelicals
pentecostal denominations also began to interact with each other both on national levels and international levels through the pentecostal world fellowship which was founded in
some pentecostal churches in europe especially in italy and germany during the war were also victims of the holocaust
because of their tongues speaking their members were considered mentally ill and many pastors were sent either to confinement or to concentration camps
though pentecostals began to find acceptance among evangelicals in the s the previous decade was widely viewed as a time of spiritual dryness when healings and other miraculous phenomena were perceived as being less prevalent than in earlier decades of the movement
it was in this environment that the latter rain movement the most important controversy to affect pentecostalism since world war ii began in north america and spread around the world in the late s
latter rain leaders taught the restoration of the fivefold ministry led by apostles
these apostles were believed capable of imparting spiritual gifts through the laying on of hands
there were prominent participants of the early pentecostal revivals such as stanley frodsham and lewi pethrus who endorsed the movement citing similarities to early pentecostalism
however pentecostal denominations were critical of the movement and condemned many of its practices as unscriptural
one reason for the conflict with the denominations was the sectarianism of latter rain adherents
many autonomous churches were birthed out of the revival
a simultaneous development within pentecostalism was the postwar healing revival
led by healing evangelists william branham oral roberts gordon lindsay and t
osborn the healing revival developed a following among non pentecostals as well as pentecostals
many of these non pentecostals were baptized in the holy spirit through these ministries
the latter rain and the healing revival influenced many leaders of the charismatic movement of the s and s
before the s most non pentecostal christians who experienced the pentecostal baptism in the holy spirit typically kept their experience a private matter or joined a pentecostal church afterward
the s saw a new pattern develop where large numbers of spirit baptized christians from mainline churches in the us europe and other parts of the world chose to remain and work for spiritual renewal within their traditional churches
this initially became known as new or neo pentecostalism in contrast to the older classical pentecostalism but eventually became known as the charismatic movement
while cautiously supportive of the charismatic movement the failure of charismatics to embrace traditional pentecostal teachings such as the prohibition of dancing abstinence from alcohol and other drugs such as tobacco as well as restrictions on dress and appearance following the doctrine of outward holiness initiated an identity crisis for classical pentecostals who were forced to reexamine long held assumptions about what it meant to be spirit filled
the liberalizing influence of the charismatic movement on classical pentecostalism can be seen in the disappearance of many of these taboos since the s apart from certain holiness pentecostal denominations such as the apostolic faith church which maintain these standards of outward holiness
because of this the cultural differences between classical pentecostals and charismatics have lessened over time
the global renewal movements manifest many of these tensions as inherent characteristics of pentecostalism and as representative of the character of global christianity
pentecostalism is an evangelical faith emphasizing the reliability of the bible and the need for the transformation of an individual s life through faith in jesus
like other evangelicals pentecostals generally adhere to the bible s divine inspiration and inerrancy the belief that the bible in the original manuscripts in which it was written is without error
pentecostals emphasize the teaching of the full gospel or foursquare gospel
the term foursquare refers to the four fundamental beliefs of pentecostalism jesus saves according to john baptizes with the holy spirit according to acts heals bodily according to james and is coming again to receive those who are saved according to thessalonians
the central belief of classical pentecostalism is that through the death burial and resurrection of jesus christ sins can be forgiven and humanity reconciled with god
this is the gospel or good news
the fundamental requirement of pentecostalism is that one be born again
the new birth is received by the grace of god through faith in christ as lord and savior
in being born again the believer is regenerated justified adopted into the family of god and the holy spirit s work of sanctification is initiated
classical pentecostal soteriology is generally arminian rather than calvinist
the security of the believer is a doctrine held within pentecostalism nevertheless this security is conditional upon continual faith and repentance
pentecostals believe in both a literal heaven and hell the former for those who have accepted god s gift of salvation and the latter for those who have rejected it
for most pentecostals there is no other requirement to receive salvation
baptism with the holy spirit and speaking in tongues are not generally required though pentecostal converts are usually encouraged to seek these experiences
a notable exception is jesus name pentecostalism most adherents of which believe both water baptism and spirit baptism are integral components of salvation
pentecostals identify three distinct uses of the word baptism in the new testament
baptism into the body of christ this refers to salvation
every believer in christ is made a part of his body the church through baptism
the holy spirit is the agent and the body of christ is the medium
water baptism symbolic of dying to the world and living in christ water baptism is an outward symbolic expression of that which has already been accomplished by the holy spirit namely baptism into the body of christ
baptism with the holy spirit this is an experience distinct from baptism into the body of christ
in this baptism christ is the agent and the holy spirit is the medium while the figure of jesus christ and his redemptive work are at the center of pentecostal theology that redemptive work is believed to provide for a fullness of the holy spirit of which believers in christ may take advantage
the majority of pentecostals believe that at the moment a person is born again the new believer has the presence indwelling of the holy spirit
while the spirit dwells in every christian pentecostals believe that all christians should seek to be filled with him
the spirit s filling falling upon coming upon or being poured out upon believers is called the baptism with the holy spirit
pentecostals define it as a definite experience occurring after salvation whereby the holy spirit comes upon the believer to anoint and empower them for special service
it has also been described as a baptism into the love of god
the main purpose of the experience is to grant power for christian service
other purposes include power for spiritual warfare the christian struggles against spiritual enemies and thus requires spiritual power power for overflow the believer s experience of the presence and power of god in their life flows out into the lives of others and power for ability to follow divine direction to face persecution to exercise spiritual gifts for the edification of the church etc
pentecostals believe that the baptism with the holy spirit is available to all christians
repentance from sin and being born again are fundamental requirements to receive it
there must also be in the believer a deep conviction of needing more of god in their life and a measure of consecration by which the believer yields themself to the will of god
citing instances in the book of acts where believers were spirit baptized before they were baptized with water most pentecostals believe a christian need not have been baptized in water to receive spirit baptism
however pentecostals do believe that the biblical pattern is repentance regeneration water baptism and then the baptism with the holy ghost
there are pentecostal believers who have claimed to receive their baptism with the holy spirit while being water baptized
it is received by having faith in god s promise to fill the believer and in yielding the entire being to christ
certain conditions if present in a believer s life could cause delay in receiving spirit baptism such as weak faith unholy living imperfect consecration and egocentric motives
in the absence of these pentecostals teach that seekers should maintain a persistent faith in the knowledge that god will fulfill his promise
for pentecostals there is no prescribed manner in which a believer will be filled with the spirit
it could be expected or unexpected during public or private prayer
pentecostals expect certain results following baptism with the holy spirit
some of these are immediate while others are enduring or permanent
most pentecostal denominations teach that speaking in tongues is an immediate or initial physical evidence that one has received the experience
some teach that any of the gifts of the spirit can be evidence of having received spirit baptism
other immediate evidences include giving god praise having joy and desiring to testify about jesus
enduring or permanent results in the believer s life include christ glorified and revealed in a greater way a deeper passion for souls greater power to witness to nonbelievers a more effective prayer life greater love for and insight into the bible and the manifestation of the gifts of the spirit
holiness pentecostals with their background in the wesleyan holiness movement historically teach that baptism with the holy spirit as evidenced by glossolalia is the third work of grace which follows the new birth first work of grace and entire sanctification second work of grace
while the baptism with the holy spirit is a definite experience in a believer s life pentecostals view it as just the beginning of living a spirit filled life
pentecostal teaching stresses the importance of continually being filled with the spirit
there is only one baptism with the spirit but there should be many infillings with the spirit throughout the believer s life
pentecostalism is a holistic faith and the belief that jesus is healer is one quarter of the full gospel
pentecostals cite four major reasons for believing in divine healing it is reported in the bible jesus healing ministry is included in his atonement thus divine healing is part of salvation the whole gospel is for the whole person spirit soul and body sickness is a consequence of the fall of man and salvation is ultimately the restoration of the fallen world
in the words of pentecostal scholar vernon l
purdy because sin leads to human suffering it was only natural for the early church to understand the ministry of christ as the alleviation of human suffering since he was god s answer to sin
the restoration of fellowship with god is the most important thing but this restoration not only results in spiritual healing but many times in physical healing as well in the book in pursuit of wholeness experiencing god s salvation for the total person pentecostal writer and church historian wilfred graves jr
describes the healing of the body as a physical expression of salvation
for pentecostals spiritual and physical healing serves as a reminder and testimony to christ s future return when his people will be completely delivered from all the consequences of the fall
however not everyone receives healing when they pray
it is god in his sovereign wisdom who either grants or withholds healing
common reasons that are given in answer to the question as to why all are not healed include god teaches through suffering healing is not always immediate lack of faith on the part of the person needing healing and personal sin in one s life however this does not mean that all illness is caused by personal sin
regarding healing and prayer purdy states
pentecostals believe that prayer and faith are central in receiving healing
pentecostals look to scriptures such as james for direction regarding healing prayer
one can pray for one s own healing verse and for the healing of others verse no special gift or clerical status is necessary
verses supply the framework for congregational healing prayer
the sick person expresses their faith by calling for the elders of the church who pray over and anoint the sick with olive oil
the oil is a symbol of the holy spirit
besides prayer there are other ways in which pentecostals believe healing can be received
one way is based on mark and involves believers laying hands on the sick
this is done in imitation of jesus who often healed in this manner
another method that is found in some pentecostal churches is based on the account in acts where people were healed when given handkerchiefs or aprons worn by the apostle paul
this practice is described by duffield and van cleave in foundations of pentecostal theology
during the initial decades of the movement pentecostals thought it was sinful to take medicine or receive care from doctors
over time pentecostals moderated their views concerning medicine and doctor visits however a minority of pentecostal churches continues to rely exclusively on prayer and divine healing
for example doctors in the united kingdom reported that a minority of pentecostal hiv patients were encouraged to stop taking their medicines and parents were told to stop giving medicine to their children trends that placed lives at risk
the last element of the gospel is that jesus is the soon coming king
for pentecostals every moment is eschatological since at any time christ may return
this personal and imminent second coming is for pentecostals the motivation for practical christian living including personal holiness meeting together for worship faithful christian service and evangelism both personal and worldwide
globally pentecostal attitudes to the end times range from enthusiastic participation in the prophecy subculture to a complete lack of interest through to the more recent optimistic belief in the coming restoration of god s kingdom
historically however they have been premillennial dispensationalists believing in a pretribulation rapture
pre tribulation rapture theology was popularized extensively in the s by john nelson darby and further popularized in the united states in the early th century by the wide circulation of the scofield reference bible
pentecostals are continuationists meaning they believe that all of the spiritual gifts including the miraculous or sign gifts found in corinthians romans and ephesians continue to operate within the church in the present time
pentecostals place the gifts of the spirit in context with the fruit of the spirit
the fruit of the spirit is the result of the new birth and continuing to abide in christ
it is by the fruit exhibited that spiritual character is assessed
spiritual gifts are received as a result of the baptism with the holy spirit
as gifts freely given by the holy spirit they cannot be earned or merited and they are not appropriate criteria with which to evaluate one s spiritual life or maturity
pentecostals see in the biblical writings of paul an emphasis on having both character and power exercising the gifts in love
just as fruit should be evident in the life of every christian pentecostals believe that every spirit filled believer is given some capacity for the manifestation of the spirit
it is important to note that the exercise of a gift is a manifestation of the spirit not of the gifted person and though the gifts operate through people they are primarily gifts given to the church
they are valuable only when they minister spiritual profit and edification to the body of christ
pentecostal writers point out that the lists of spiritual gifts in the new testament do not seem to be exhaustive
it is generally believed that there are as many gifts as there are useful ministries and functions in the church
a spiritual gift is often exercised in partnership with another gift
for example in a pentecostal church service the gift of tongues might be exercised followed by the operation of the gift of interpretation
according to pentecostals all manifestations of the spirit are to be judged by the church
this is made possible in part by the gift of discerning of spirits which is the capacity for discerning the source of a spiritual manifestation whether from the holy spirit an evil spirit or from the human spirit
while pentecostals believe in the current operation of all the spiritual gifts within the church their teaching on some of these gifts has generated more controversy and interest than others
there are different ways in which the gifts have been grouped
jones suggests three categories illumination word of wisdom word of knowledge discerning of spirits action faith working of miracles and gifts of healings and communication prophecy tongues and interpretation of tongues
duffield and van cleave use two categories the vocal and the power gifts
the gifts of prophecy tongues interpretation of tongues and words of wisdom and knowledge are called the vocal gifts
pentecostals look to corinthians for instructions on the proper use of the spiritual gifts especially the vocal ones
pentecostals believe that prophecy is the vocal gift of preference a view derived from corinthians
some teach that the gift of tongues is equal to the gift of prophecy when tongues are interpreted
prophetic and glossolalic utterances are not to replace the preaching of the word of god nor to be considered as equal to or superseding the written word of god which is the final authority for determining teaching and doctrine
pentecostals understand the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge to be supernatural revelations of wisdom and knowledge by the holy spirit
the word of wisdom is defined as a revelation of the holy spirit that applies scriptural wisdom to a specific situation that a christian community faces
the word of knowledge is often defined as the ability of one person to know what god is currently doing or intends to do in the life of another person
pentecostals agree with the protestant principle of sola scriptura
the bible is the all sufficient rule for faith and practice it is fixed finished and objective revelation
alongside this high regard for the authority of scripture is a belief that the gift of prophecy continues to operate within the church
pentecostal theologians duffield and van cleave described the gift of prophecy in the following manner normally in the operation of the gift of prophecy the spirit heavily anoints the believer to speak forth to the body not premeditated words but words the spirit supplies spontaneously in order to uplift and encourage incite to faithful obedience and service and to bring comfort and consolation
any spirit filled christian according to pentecostal theology has the potential as with all the gifts to prophesy
sometimes prophecy can overlap with preaching where great unpremeditated truth or application is provided by the spirit or where special revelation is given beforehand in prayer and is empowered in the delivery
while a prophetic utterance at times might foretell future events this is not the primary purpose of pentecostal prophecy and is never to be used for personal guidance
for pentecostals prophetic utterances are fallible i e
subject to error
pentecostals teach that believers must discern whether the utterance has edifying value for themselves and the local church
because prophecies are subject to the judgement and discernment of other christians most pentecostals teach that prophetic utterances should never be spoken in the first person e g
i the lord but always in the third person e g
thus saith the lord or the lord would have
a pentecostal believer in a spiritual experience may vocalize fluent unintelligible utterances glossolalia or articulate a natural language previously unknown to them xenoglossy
commonly termed speaking in tongues this vocal phenomenon is believed by pentecostals to include an endless variety of languages
according to pentecostal theology the language spoken may be an unlearned human language such as the bible claims happened on the day of pentecost or it might be of heavenly angelic origin
in the first case tongues could work as a sign by which witness is given to the unsaved
in the second case tongues are used for praise and prayer when the mind is superseded and the speaker in tongues speaks to god speaks mysteries and
no one understands him
within pentecostalism there is a belief that speaking in tongues serves two functions
tongues as the initial evidence of the third work of grace baptism with the holy spirit and in individual prayer serves a different purpose than tongues as a spiritual gift
all spirit filled believers according to initial evidence proponents will speak in tongues when baptized in the spirit and thereafter will be able to express prayer and praise to god in an unknown tongue
this type of tongue speaking forms an important part of many pentecostals personal daily devotions
when used in this way it is referred to as a prayer language as the believer is speaking unknown languages not for the purpose of communicating with others but for communication between the soul and god
its purpose is for the spiritual edification of the individual
pentecostals believe the private use of tongues in prayer i e
prayer in the spirit promotes a deepening of the prayer life and the spiritual development of the personality
from romans pentecostals believe that the spirit intercedes for believers through tongues in other words when a believer prays in an unknown tongue the holy spirit is supernaturally directing the believer s prayer
besides acting as a prayer language tongues also function as the gift of tongues
not all spirit filled believers possess the gift of tongues
its purpose is for gifted persons to publicly speak with god in praise to pray or sing in the spirit or to speak forth in the congregation
there is a division among pentecostals on the relationship between the gifts of tongues and prophecy
one school of thought believes that the gift of tongues is always directed from man to god in which case it is always prayer or praise spoken to god but in the hearing of the entire congregation for encouragement and consolation
another school of thought believes that the gift of tongues can be prophetic in which case the believer delivers a message in tongues a prophetic utterance given under the influence of the holy spirit to a congregation
whether prophetic or not however pentecostals are agreed that all public utterances in an unknown tongue must be interpreted in the language of the gathered christians
this is accomplished by the gift of interpretation and this gift can be exercised by the same individual who first delivered the message if he or she possesses the gift of interpretation or by another individual who possesses the required gift
if a person with the gift of tongues is not sure that a person with the gift of interpretation is present and is unable to interpret the utterance themself then the person should not speak
pentecostals teach that those with the gift of tongues should pray for the gift of interpretation
pentecostals do not require that an interpretation be a literal word for word translation of a glossolalic utterance
rather as the word interpretation implies pentecostals expect only an accurate explanation of the utterance s meaning
besides the gift of tongues pentecostals may also use glossolalia as a form of praise and worship in corporate settings
pentecostals in a church service may pray aloud in tongues while others pray simultaneously in the common language of the gathered christians
this use of glossolalia is seen as an acceptable form of prayer and therefore requires no interpretation
congregations may also corporately sing in tongues a phenomenon known as singing in the spirit
speaking in tongues is not universal among pentecostal christians
in a ten country survey by the pew forum on religion and public life found that percent of pentecostals in the us percent in brazil percent in south africa and percent in india said they never speak or pray in tongues
the gifts of power are distinct from the vocal gifts in that they do not involve utterance
included in this category are the gift of faith gifts of healing and the gift of miracles
the gift of faith sometimes called special faith is different from saving faith and normal christian faith in its degree and application
this type of faith is a manifestation of the spirit granted only to certain individuals in times of special crisis or opportunity and endues them with a divine certainty
that triumphs over everything
it is sometimes called the faith of miracles and is fundamental to the operation of the other two power gifts
during the s the finished work pentecostal movement split over the nature of the godhead into two camps trinitarian and apostolic as they called themselves or oneness
the oneness doctrine viewed the doctrine of the trinity as polytheistic
the majority of pentecostal denominations believe in the doctrine of the trinity which is considered by them to be christian orthodoxy these include holiness pentecostals and finished work pentecostals
oneness pentecostals are nontrinitarian christians believing in the oneness theology about god
in oneness theology the godhead is not three persons united by one substance but one god who reveals himself in three different modes
thus god relates himself to humanity as our father within creation he manifests himself in human form as the son by virtue of his incarnation as jesus christ timothy and he is the holy spirit john by way of his activity in the life of the believer
oneness pentecostals believe that jesus is the name of god and therefore baptize in the name of jesus christ as performed by the apostles acts fulfilling the instructions left by jesus christ in the great commission matthew they believe that jesus is the only name given to mankind by which we must be saved acts
the oneness doctrine may be considered a form of modalism an ancient teaching considered heresy by the roman catholic church and other trinitarian denominations
in contrast trinitarian pentecostals hold to the doctrine of the trinity that is the godhead is not seen as simply three modes or titles of god manifest at different points in history but is constituted of three completely distinct persons who are co eternal with each other and united as one substance
the son is from all eternity who became incarnate as jesus and likewise the holy spirit is from all eternity and both are with the eternal father from all eternity
traditional pentecostal worship has been described as a gestalt made up of prayer singing sermon the operation of the gifts of the spirit altar intercession offering announcements testimonies musical specials scripture reading and occasionally the lord s supper
russell p
spittler identified five values that govern pentecostal spirituality
the first was individual experience which emphasizes the holy spirit s personal work in the life of the believer
second was orality a feature that might explain pentecostalism s success in evangelizing nonliterate cultures
the third was spontaneity members of pentecostal congregations are expected to follow the leading of the holy spirit sometimes resulting in unpredictable services
the fourth value governing pentecostal spirituality was otherworldliness or asceticism which was partly informed by pentecostal eschatology
the final and fifth value was a commitment to biblical authority and many of the distinctive practices of pentecostals are derived from a literal reading of scripture
spontaneity is a characteristic element of pentecostal worship
this was especially true in the movement s earlier history when anyone could initiate a song chorus or spiritual gift
even as pentecostalism has become more organized and formal with more control exerted over services the concept of spontaneity has retained an important place within the movement and continues to inform stereotypical imagery such as the derogatory holy roller
the phrase quench not the spirit derived from thessalonians is used commonly and captures the thought behind pentecostal spontaneity
prayer plays an important role in pentecostal worship
collective oral prayer whether glossolalic or in the vernacular or a mix of both is common
while praying individuals may lay hands on a person in need of prayer or they may raise their hands in response to biblical commands timothy
the raising of hands which itself is a revival of the ancient orans posture is an example of some pentecostal worship practices that have been widely adopted by the larger christian world
pentecostal musical and liturgical practice have also played an influential role in shaping contemporary worship trends with pentecostal churches such as hillsong church being the leading producers of congregational music
several spontaneous practices have become characteristic of pentecostal worship
being slain in the spirit or falling under the power is a form of prostration in which a person falls backwards as if fainting while being prayed over
it is at times accompanied by glossolalic prayer at other times the person is silent
it is believed by pentecostals to be caused by an overwhelming experience of the presence of god and pentecostals sometimes receive the baptism in the holy spirit in this posture
another spontaneous practice is dancing in the spirit
this is when a person leaves their seat spontaneously dancing with eyes closed without bumping into nearby persons or objects
it is explained as the worshipper becoming so enraptured with god s presence that the spirit takes control of physical motions as well as the spiritual and emotional being
pentecostals derive biblical precedent for dancing in worship from samuel where david danced before the lord
a similar occurrence is often called running the aisles
the jericho march inspired by book of joshua is a celebratory practice occurring at times of high enthusiasm
members of a congregation began to spontaneously leave their seats and walk in the aisles inviting other members as they go
eventually a full column forms around the perimeter of the meeting space as worshipers march with singing and loud shouts of praise and jubilation
another spontaneous manifestation found in some pentecostal churches is holy laughter in which worshippers uncontrollably laugh
in some pentecostal churches these spontaneous expressions are primarily found in revival services especially those that occur at tent revivals and camp meetings or special prayer meetings being rare or non existent in the main services
like other christian churches pentecostals believe that certain rituals or ceremonies were instituted as a pattern and command by jesus in the new testament
pentecostals commonly call these ceremonies ordinances
many christians call these sacraments but this term is not generally used by pentecostals and certain other protestants as they do not see ordinances as imparting grace
instead the term sacerdotal ordinance is used to denote the distinctive belief that grace is received directly from god by the congregant with the officiant serving only to facilitate rather than acting as a conduit or vicar
the ordinance of water baptism is an outward symbol of an inner conversion that has already taken place
therefore most pentecostal groups practice believer s baptism by immersion
the majority of pentecostals do not view baptism as essential for salvation and likewise most pentecostals are trinitarian and use the traditional trinitarian baptismal formula
however oneness pentecostals view baptism as an essential and necessary part of the salvation experience and as non trinitarians reject the use of the traditional baptismal formula
for more information on oneness pentecostal baptismal beliefs see the following section on statistics and denominations
the ordinance of holy communion or the lord s supper is seen as a direct command given by jesus at the last supper to be done in remembrance of him
pentecostal denominations who traditionally support the temperance movement reject the use of wine as part of communion using grape juice instead
certain pentecostal denominations observe the ordinance of women s headcovering in obedience to corinthians
foot washing is also held as an ordinance by some pentecostals
it is considered an ordinance of humility because jesus showed humility when washing his disciples feet in john
other pentecostals do not consider it an ordinance however they may still recognize spiritual value in the practice
in david barrett estimated there were million denominational pentecostals throughout the world
in a pew forum study of global christianity found that there were an estimated million classical pentecostals making percent of the total world population and percent of the world s christian population pentecostal
the study found historically pentecostal denominations a category that did not include independent pentecostal churches to be the largest protestant denominational family
the largest percentage of pentecostals are found in sub saharan africa percent followed by the americas percent and asia and the pacific percent
the movement is enjoying its greatest surge today in the global south which includes africa central and latin america and most of asia
there are recognized pentecostal denominations but the movement also has a significant number of independent churches that are not organized into denominations
among the over pentecostal denominations are classified as part of wesleyan holiness or methodistic pentecostalism
until pentecostalism was universally wesleyan in doctrine and holiness pentecostalism continues to predominate in the southern united states
wesleyan pentecostals teach that there are three crisis experiences within a christian s life conversion sanctification and spirit baptism
they inherited the holiness movement s belief in entire sanctification
according to wesleyan pentecostals entire sanctification is a definite event that occurs after salvation but before spirit baptism
this inward experience cleanses and enables the believer to live a life of outward holiness
this personal cleansing prepares the believer to receive the baptism in the holy spirit
holiness pentecostal denominations include the apostolic faith church free gospel church church of god in christ church of god cleveland tennessee and the pentecostal holiness church
in the united states many holiness pentecostal clergy are educated at the free gospel bible institute in murrysville pennsylvania
after william h
durham began preaching his finished work doctrine in many pentecostals rejected the wesleyan doctrine of entire sanctification and began to teach that there were only two definite crisis experiences in the life of a christian conversion and spirit baptism
these finished work pentecostals also known as baptistic or reformed pentecostals because many converts were originally drawn from baptist and presbyterian backgrounds teach that a person is initially sanctified at the moment of conversion
after conversion the believer grows in grace through a lifelong process of progressive sanctification
there are denominations that adhere to the finished work position
they include the assemblies of god the foursquare gospel church and the open bible churches
the welsh revival laid the foundation for british pentecostalism and especially for a distinct family of denominations known as apostolic pentecostalism not to be confused with oneness pentecostalism
these pentecostals are led by a hierarchy of living apostles prophets and other charismatic offices
apostolic pentecostals are found worldwide in denominations including the apostolic church based in the united kingdom
there are pentecostal denominations that are classified as jesus name or oneness pentecostalism often self identifying as apostolic pentecostals
these differ from the rest of pentecostalism in several significant ways
oneness pentecostals reject the doctrine of the trinity
they do not describe god as three persons but rather as three manifestations of the one living god
oneness pentecostals practice jesus name baptism water baptisms performed in the name of jesus christ rather than that of the trinity
oneness pentecostal adherents believe repentance baptism in jesus name and spirit baptism are all essential elements of the conversion experience
oneness pentecostals hold that repentance is necessary before baptism to make the ordinance valid and receipt of the holy spirit manifested by speaking in other tongues is necessary afterwards to complete the work of baptism
this differs from other pentecostals along with evangelical christians in general who see only repentance and faith in christ as essential to salvation
this has resulted in oneness believers being accused by some including other pentecostals of a works salvation soteriology a charge they vehemently deny
oneness pentecostals insist that salvation comes by grace through faith in christ coupled with obedience to his command to be born of water and of the spirit hence no good works or obedience to laws or rules can save anyone
for them baptism is not seen as a work but rather the indispensable means that jesus himself provided to come into his kingdom
the major oneness churches include the united pentecostal church international and the pentecostal assemblies of the world
in addition to the denominational pentecostal churches there are many pentecostal churches that choose to exist independently of denominational oversight
some of these churches may be doctrinally identical to the various pentecostal denominations while others may adopt beliefs and practices that differ considerably from classical pentecostalism such as word of faith teachings or kingdom now theology
some of these groups have been successful in utilizing the mass media especially television and radio to spread their message
according to a denomination census in the assemblies of god the largest pentecostal denomination in the world has churches and members worldwide
the other major international pentecostal denominations are the apostolic church with members the church of god cleveland with churches and members the foursquare church with churches and members
among the censuses carried out by pentecostal denominations published in those claiming the most members were on each continent
in africa the redeemed christian church of god with churches and million members
in north america the assemblies of god usa with churches and members
in south america the general convention of the assemblies of god in brazil with members
in asia the indonesian bethel church with churches and members
in europe the assemblies of god of france with churches and members
in oceania the australian christian churches with churches and members
zora neale hurston performed anthropological sociological studies examining the spread of pentecostalism
according to scholar of religion ashon crawley hurston s analysis is important because she understood the class struggle that this seemingly new religiocultural movement articulated the sanctified church is a protest against the high brow tendency in negro protestant congregations as the negroes gain more education and wealth she stated that this sect was a revitalizing element in negro music and religion and that this collection of groups was putting back into negro religion those elements which were brought over from africa and grafted onto christianity crawley would go on to argue that the shouting that hurston documented was evidence of what martinique psychoanalyst frantz fanon called the refusal of positionality wherein no strategic position is given preference as the creation of the grounds for social form
pentecostalism is a religious phenomenon more visible in the cities
however it has attracted significant rural populations in latin america africa and eastern europe
sociologist david martin has called attention on an overview on the rural protestantism in latin america focusing on the indigenous and peasant conversion to pentecostalism
the cultural change resulting from the countryside modernization has reflected on the peasant way of life
consequently many peasants especially in latin america have experienced collective conversion to different forms of pentecostalism and interpreted as a response to modernization in the countryside
rather than a mere religious shift from folk catholicism to pentecostalism peasant pentecostals have dealt with agency to employ many of their cultural resources to respond development projects in a modernization framework
researching guatemalan peasants and indigenous communities sheldon annis argued that conversion to pentecostalism was a way to quit the burdensome obligations of the cargo system
mayan folk catholicism has many fiestas with a rotation leadership who must pay the costs and organize the yearly patron saint festivities
one of the socially accepted many to opt out those obligations was to convert to pentecostalism
by doing so the pentecostal peasant engage in a penny capitalism
in the same lines of moral obligations but with different mechanism economic self help paul chandler has compared the differences between catholic and pentecostal peasants and has found a web of reciprocity among catholics compadres which the pentecostals lacked
however alves has found that the different pentecostal congregations replaces the compadrazgo system and still provide channels to exercise the reciprocal obligations that the peasant moral economy demands
conversion to pentecostalism provides a rupture with a socially disrupted past while allowing to maintain elements of the peasant ethos
brazil has provided many cases to evaluate this thesis
hoekstra has found out that rural pentecostalism more as a continuity of the traditional past though with some ruptures
anthropologist brand o sees the small town and rural pentecostalism as another face for folk religiosity instead of a path to modernization
with similar finding abumanssur regards pentecostalism as an attempt to conciliate traditional worldviews of folk religion with modernity
identity shift has been noticed among rural converts to pentecostalism
indigenous and peasant communities have found in the pentecostal religion a new identity that helps them navigate the challenges posed by modernity
this identity shift corroborates the thesis that the peasant pentecostals pave their own ways when facing modernization
various christian groups have criticized the pentecostal and charismatic movement for too much attention to mystical manifestations such as glossolalia which for a believer would be the obligatory sign of a baptism with the holy spirit along with falls to the ground moans and cries during worship services as well as anti intellectualism
a particularly controversial doctrine in the evangelical churches is that of the prosperity theology which spread in the s and s in the united states mainly through pentecostals and charismatics televangelists
this doctrine is centered on the teaching of christian faith as a means to enrich oneself financially and materially through a positive confession and a contribution to christian ministries
promises of divine healing and prosperity are guaranteed in exchange for certain amounts of donations
fidelity in the tithe would allow one to avoid the curses of god the attacks of the devil and poverty
the offerings and the tithe occupies a lot of time in the worship services
often associated with the tithe mandatory this doctrine is sometimes compared to a religious business
in the national council of evangelicals of france published a document denouncing this doctrine mentioning that prosperity was indeed possible for a believer but that this theology taken to the extreme leads to materialism and to idolatry which is not the purpose of the gospel
pentecostal pastors adhering to prosperity theology have been criticized by journalists for their lavish lifestyle luxury clothes big houses high end cars private aircraft etc
in pentecostalism rifts accompanied the teaching of faith healing
in some churches pricing for prayer against promises of healing has been observed
some pastors and evangelists have been charged with claiming false healings
some churches have advised their members against vaccination or other medicine stating that it is for those weak in the faith and that with a positive confession they would be immune from the disease
in in mbandjock in cameroon three deaths were linked to this position in a church
this position is not representative of all evangelical churches
the miraculous healing published in by the national council of evangelicals of france mentions that medicine is one of the gifts of god gave to humans
churches and certain evangelical humanitarian organizations are also involved in medical health programs
