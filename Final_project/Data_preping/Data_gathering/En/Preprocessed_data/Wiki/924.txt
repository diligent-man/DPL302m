in boudry pulled a sokal style hoax
boudry wanted to put christian philosophers to the test by writing a meaningless abstract full of theological jargon with the title the paradoxes of darwinian disorder
towards an ontological reaffirmation of order and transcendence
the abstract contained sentences such as in the darwinian perspective order is not immanent in reality but it is a self affirming aspect of reality in so far as it is experienced by situated subjects under the anagram pseudonym robert a
maundy from the fictitious college of the holy cross in reno nevada boudry submitted the abstract to the organizers of the christian philosophical conference the future of creation order at the vu university amsterdam and the centre of theology and philosophy at the university of nottingham which both accepted it without any reservations
the hoax which boudry revealed in mid on facebook but became more widely known only after the american scientist jerry coyne blogged about it received attention in a number of dutch protestant newspapers such as reformatorisch dagblad trouw and nederlands dagblad
when asked in an interview with the dutch popular philosophy magazine filosofie magazine about the reason for the hoax boudry said the following
no one had discovered that robert a
maundy and the college of the holy cross did not exist
gerrit glas president of the conference at the time found the text to be odd and said they had hesitated for a long time but ultimately decided to give maundy the benefit of the doubt
glas admitted that he should have been more critical and defended himself by saying that it is not uncommon for texts on process theology negative theology and postmodernism to be inscrutable
philosopher of religion taede a
smedes at the radboud university nijmegen considered boudry s action to be unworthy of an academic but also found it astonishing that the conference organizers had accepted the text anyone who makes the simple effort to understand the first sentences of boudry maundry s sic abstract if that is even possible will immediately notice that it is incomprehensible nonsense
maarten boudry is mainly known for his skepticism and critical attitude toward pseudoscience
as a philosopher of science one of his main interests is the study of pseudoscience in all its forms and expressions
he studies the fallibility of human reasoning that might underlie pseudoscience and irrationality
boudry characterizes pseudoscience as an imitation of real science
in his ma thesis entitled de naakte keizers van de psychoanalyse the naked emperors of psychoanalysis he explains why he classifies psychoanalysis as a pseudoscience and which immunizing strategies this school of thought has developed over the years to withstand criticism
together with philosopher johan braeckman he wrote the book de ongelovige thomas heeft een punt doubting thomas has a point in which they offer arguments against parascience and pseudoscience blind faith wishful thinking astrology irrationality psychokinesis and dowsing as they consider these ideas to be grounded in logical fallacies
the title refers to the attitude of thomas the apostle who was initially skeptical when he was told that jesus had been resurrected
in an interview boudry said
in publications and debates boudry also criticizes religion intelligent design and theology
in during the dutch nationale religiedebat national religion debate philosophers maarten boudry and herman philipse both of whom are atheists debated stefan paas and rik peels on the question of whether belief in a god is reasonable and what the impact of nonbelief on morality is
