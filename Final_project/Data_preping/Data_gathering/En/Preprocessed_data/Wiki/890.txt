hydroelectricity or hydroelectric power is electricity produced from hydropower
in hydropower generated one sixth of the world s electricity almost twh which was more than all other renewables combined and also more than nuclear power
hydropower can supply large amounts of low carbon electricity on demand making it key to many secure and clean electricity grids
with a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be varied up or down in seconds or minutes to adapt to changing energy demands
once a hydroelectric complex is constructed the project produces no direct waste and it almost always has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than fossil fuel powered energy plants
however when constructed in lowland rainforest areas where inundation of a part of the forest is necessary they can emit substantial amounts of greenhouse gases
the construction of a hydroelectric complex can cause significant environmental impact principally in loss of arable land and population displacement
they also disrupt the natural ecology of the river involved affecting habitats and ecosystems and the siltation and erosion patterns
while dams can ameliorate the risks of flooding dam failure can be catastrophic
hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks
in the late th century hydraulic power provided the energy source needed for the start of the industrial revolution
in the mid s french engineer bernard forest de b lidor published architecture hydraulique which described vertical and horizontal axis hydraulic machines and in richard arkwright s combination of water power the water frame and continuous production played a significant part in the development of the factory system with modern employment practices
in the s the hydraulic power network was developed to generate and transmit hydro power to end users
by the late th century the electrical generator was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics
the growing demand arising from the industrial revolution would drive development as well
in the world s first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at cragside in northumberland england by william armstrong
it was used to power a single arc lamp in his art gallery
the old schoelkopf power station no
us near niagara falls began to produce electricity in
the first edison hydroelectric power station the vulcan street plant began operating september in appleton wisconsin with an output of about kilowatts
by there were hydroelectric power stations in the united states and canada and by there were in the united states alone
at the beginning of the th century many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas
grenoble france held the international exhibition of hydropower and tourism with over one million visitors
by when of the power produced in the united states was hydroelectric the federal power act was enacted into law
the act created the federal power commission to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water
as the power stations became larger their associated dams developed additional purposes including flood control irrigation and navigation
federal funding became necessary for large scale development and federally owned corporations such as the tennessee valley authority and the bonneville power administration were created
additionally the bureau of reclamation which had begun a series of western us irrigation projects in the early th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the hoover dam
the united states army corps of engineers was also involved in hydroelectric development completing the bonneville dam in and being recognized by the flood control act of as the premier federal flood control agency
hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the th century
hydropower was referred to as white coal
hoover dam s initial mw power station was the world s largest hydroelectric power station in it was eclipsed by the mw grand coulee dam in
the itaipu dam opened in in south america as the largest producing gw but was surpassed in by the three gorges dam in china at gw
hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries including norway democratic republic of the congo paraguay and brazil with over of their electricity
in the iea said that more efforts are needed to help limit climate change
some countries have highly developed their hydropower potential and have very little room for growth switzerland produces of its potential and mexico
in the iea said that major modernisation refurbishments are required
most hydroelectric power comes from the potential energy of dammed water driving a water turbine and generator
the power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water s outflow
this height difference is called the head
a large pipe the penstock delivers water from the reservoir to the turbine
this method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations
at times of low electrical demand the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir thus providing demand side response
when the demand becomes greater water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine
in pumped storage schemes provided almost of the world s gw of grid energy storage and improve the daily capacity factor of the generation system
pumped storage is not an energy source and appears as a negative number in listings
run of the river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment and any oversupply must pass unused
a constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run of the river
a tidal power station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides such sources are highly predictable and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs can also be dispatchable to generate power during high demand periods
less common types of hydro schemes use water s kinetic energy or undammed sources such as undershot water wheels
tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world
the largest power producers in the world are hydroelectric power stations with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current largest nuclear power stations
although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations facilities from over a few hundred megawatts are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities
currently only five facilities over gw mw are in operation worldwide see table below
small hydro is hydroelectric power on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant
the definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to megawatts mw is generally accepted as the upper limit
this may be stretched to mw and mw in canada and the united states
small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low cost renewable energy
alternatively small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a grid or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network
since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro
this decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production
micro hydro means hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to kw of power
these installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community or are sometimes connected to electric power networks
there are many of these installations around the world particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel
micro hydro systems complement photovoltaic solar energy systems because in many areas water flow and thus available hydro power is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum
pico hydro is hydroelectric power generation of under kw
it is useful in small remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity
for example the kw itdg pico hydro project in kenya supplies homes with very small electric loads e g a couple of lights and a phone changer or a small tv radio
even smaller turbines of w may power a few homes in a developing country with a drop of only m ft
a pico hydro setup is typically run of the river meaning that dams are not used but rather pipes divert some of the flow drop this down a gradient and through the turbine before returning it to the stream
an underground power station is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways such as a waterfall or mountain lake
a tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in a cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway a simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is
displaystyle p eta dot m g delta h eta rho dot v g delta h
where
displaystyle p
is power in watts
displaystyle eta
eta is the coefficient of efficiency a unitless scalar coefficient ranging from for completely inefficient to for completely efficient
displaystyle rho
rho is the density of water kg m
displaystyle dot v
is the volumetric flow rate in m s
displaystyle dot m
is the mass flow rate in kg s
displaystyle delta h
delta h is the change in height in meters
displaystyle g
is acceleration due to gravity m s efficiency is often higher that is closer to with larger and more modern turbines
annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply
in some installations the water flow rate can vary by a factor of over the course of a year
hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands
hydro turbines have a start up time of the order of a few minutes
although battery power is quicker its capacity is tiny compared to hydro
it takes less than minutes to bring most hydro units from cold start up to full load this is quicker than nuclear and almost all fossil fuel power
power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation
hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs
instead it can serve as backup for non hydro generators
the major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for dispatch later as high value clean electricity
in the iea estimated that the reservoirs of all existing conventional hydropower plants combined can store a total of terawatt hours twh of electrical energy in one full cycle which was about times more energy than the global fleet of pumped storage hydropower plants
battery storage capacity is not expected to overtake pumped storage during the s
when used as peak power to meet demand hydroelectricity has a higher value than baseload power and a much higher value compared to intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar
hydroelectric stations have long economic lives with some plants still in service after years
operating labor cost is also usually low as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation
where a dam serves multiple purposes a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation
it has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the three gorges dam will cover the construction costs after to years of full generation
however some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place
while many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks some are created to serve specific industrial enterprises
dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for aluminium electrolytic plants for example
the grand coulee dam switched to support alcoa aluminium in bellingham washington united states for american world war ii airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens in addition to aluminium power after the war
in suriname the brokopondo reservoir was constructed to provide electricity for the alcoa aluminium industry
new zealand s manapouri power station was constructed to supply electricity to the aluminium smelter at tiwai point
since hydroelectric dams do not use fuel power generation does not produce carbon dioxide
while carbon dioxide is initially produced during construction of the project and some methane is given off annually by reservoirs hydro has one of the lowest lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for electricity generation
the low greenhouse gas impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in temperate climates
greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of methane than those in temperate areas
like other non fossil fuel sources hydropower also has no emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides or other particulates
reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for water sports and become tourist attractions themselves
in some countries aquaculture in reservoirs is common
multi use dams installed for irrigation support agriculture with a relatively constant water supply
large hydro dams can control floods which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project
managing dams which are also used for other purposes such as irrigation is complicated
in the iea called for robust sustainability standards for all hydropower development with streamlined rules and regulations
large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests marshland and grasslands
damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife
the loss of land is often exacerbated by habitat fragmentation of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir
hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic ecosystems both upstream and downstream of the plant site
generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment
water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks
since turbine gates are often opened intermittently rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed
drought and seasonal changes in rainfall can severely limit hydropower
water may also be lost by evaporation
when water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream
this has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation
siltation can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam
eventually some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over top during a flood and fail
changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam
lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity
the result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power
the risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of climate change
one study from the colorado river in the united states suggest that modest climate changes such as an increase in temperature in degree celsius resulting in a decline in precipitation might reduce river run off by up to
brazil in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity as increasing temperatures lower water flow and alterations in the rainfall regime could reduce total energy production by annually by the end of the century
lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions
in lowland rainforest areas where inundation of a part of the forest is necessary it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants produce substantial amounts of methane
this is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an anaerobic environment and forming methane a greenhouse gas
according to the world commission on dams report where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity less than watts per square metre of surface area and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil fired thermal generation plant
in boreal reservoirs of canada and northern europe however greenhouse gas emissions are typically only to of any kind of conventional fossil fuel thermal generation
a new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay
another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned
in the world commission on dams estimated that dams had physically displaced million people worldwide
because large conventional dammed hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water a failure due to poor construction natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure
during typhoon nina in banqiao dam in southern china failed when more than a year s worth of rain fell within hours see banqiao dam failure
the resulting flood resulted in the deaths of people and another from epidemics
millions were left homeless
the creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as disaster at vajont dam in italy where almost people died
the malpasset dam failure in fr jus on the french riviera c te d azur southern france collapsed on december killing people in the resulting flood
smaller dams and micro hydro facilities create less risk but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned
for example the small earthen embankment kelly barnes dam failed in twenty years after its power station was decommissioned causing deaths
hydroelectricity eliminates the flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion including pollutants such as sulfur dioxide nitric oxide carbon monoxide dust and mercury in the coal
hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of coal mining and the indirect health effects of coal emissions
in the iea said that government energy policy should price in the value of the multiple public benefits provided by hydropower plants
nuclear power is relatively inflexible although it can reduce its output reasonably quickly
since the cost of nuclear power is dominated by its high infrastructure costs the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production
because of this nuclear power is mostly used for baseload
by way of contrast hydroelectricity can supply peak power at much lower cost
hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for load following
country examples where they are paired in a close to share include the electric grid in switzerland the electricity sector in sweden and to a lesser extent ukraine and the electricity sector in finland
wind power goes through predictable variation by season but is intermittent on a daily basis
maximum wind generation has little relationship to peak daily electricity consumption the wind may peak at night when power isn t needed or be still during the day when electrical demand is highest
occasionally weather patterns can result in low wind for days or weeks at a time a hydroelectric reservoir capable of storing weeks of output is useful to balance generation on the grid
peak wind power can be offset by minimum hydropower and minimum wind can be offset with maximum hydropower
in this way the easily regulated character of hydroelectricity is used to compensate for the intermittent nature of wind power
conversely in some cases wind power can be used to spare water for later use in dry seasons
an example of this is norway s trading with sweden denmark the netherlands germany and the uk
norway is hydropower while its flatland neighbors have wind power
in areas that do not have hydropower pumped storage serves a similar role but at a much higher cost and lower efficiency
the ranking of hydroelectric capacity is either by actual annual energy production or by installed capacity power rating
in hydropower generated of the worlds total electricity and of all renewable electricity
hydropower is produced in countries with the asia pacific region generated percent of global hydropower in
china is the largest hydroelectricity producer with terawatt hours of production in representing around percent of domestic electricity use
brazil canada new zealand norway paraguay austria switzerland venezuela and several other countries have a majority of the internal electric energy production from hydroelectric power
paraguay produces of its electricity from hydroelectric dams and exports of its production to brazil and to argentina
norway produces of its electricity from hydroelectric sources
large plants tend to be built by governments so although in nearly of plants were owned and operated by the private sector but of capacity was publicly owned
a hydroelectric station rarely operates at its full power rating over a full year the ratio between annual average power and installed capacity rating is the capacity factor
the installed capacity is the sum of all generator nameplate power ratings
the weighted average cost of capital is a major factor
