small hydro station may connected conventional electrical distribution network source low-cost renewable energy
alternatively small hydro project may built isolated area would uneconomic serve grid area national electrical distribution network
since small hydro project usually minimal reservoir civil construction work seen relatively low environmental impact compared large hydro
decreased environmental impact depends strongly balance stream flow power production
micro hydro mean hydroelectric power installation typically produce kw power
installation provide power isolated home small community sometimes connected electric power networks
many installation around world particularly developing nation provide economical source energy without purchase fuel
micro hydro system complement photovoltaic solar energy system many area water flow thus available hydro power highest winter solar energy minimum
useful small remote community require small amount electricity

hydropower flexible source electricity since station ramped quickly adapt changing energy demands
although battery power quicker capacity tiny compared hydro
take le minute bring hydro unit cold start-up full load quicker nuclear almost fossil fuel power
power generation also decreased quickly surplus power generation
hence limited capacity hydropower unit generally used produce base power except vacating flood pool meeting downstream needs

damming interrupt flow river harm local ecosystem building large dam reservoir often involves displacing people wildlife
loss land often exacerbated habitat fragmentation surrounding area caused reservoir
hydroelectric project disruptive surrounding aquatic ecosystem upstream downstream plant site
water exiting turbine usually contains little suspended sediment lead scouring river bed loss riverbanks
since turbine gate often opened intermittently rapid even daily fluctuation river flow observed
water flow ha ability transport particle heavier downstream
ha negative effect dam subsequently power station particularly river within catchment area high siltation
siltation fill reservoir reduce capacity control flood along causing additional horizontal pressure upstream portion dam
eventually reservoir become full sediment useless over-top flood fail

iea said government energy policy price value multiple public benefit provided hydropower plants
nuclear power relatively inflexible although reduce output reasonably quickly
since cost nuclear power dominated high infrastructure cost cost per unit energy go significantly low production
way contrast hydroelectricity supply peak power much lower cost
hydroelectricity thus often used complement nuclear source load following
country example paired close share include electric grid switzerland electricity sector sweden lesser extent ukraine electricity sector finland
wind power go predictable variation season intermittent daily basis
maximum wind generation ha little relationship peak daily electricity consumption wind may peak night power needed still day electrical demand highest
occasionally weather pattern result low wind day week time hydroelectric reservoir capable storing week output useful balance generation grid
peak wind power offset minimum hydropower minimum wind offset maximum hydropower
way easily regulated character hydroelectricity used compensate intermittent nature wind power
