The legal institution of human chattel slavery comprising the enslavement primarily of Africans and African Americans was prevalent in the United States of America from its founding in until Slavery was established throughout European colonization in the Americas From during early colonial days it was practiced in Britain's colonies including the Thirteen Colonies that formed the United States Under the law an enslaved person was treated as property that could be bought sold or given away Slavery lasted in about half of U S states until abolition In the decades after the end of Reconstruction many of slavery's economic and social functions were continued through segregation sharecropping and convict leasing
By the time of the American Revolution the status of enslaved people had been institutionalized as a racial caste associated with African ancestry During and immediately following the Revolution abolitionist laws were passed in most Northern states and a movement developed to abolish slavery The role of slavery under the United States Constitution was the most contentious issue during its drafting Although the creators of the Constitution never used the word slavery the final document through the three fifths clause gave slave owners disproportionate political power by augmenting the congressional representation and the Electoral College votes of slaveholding states All Northern states had abolished slavery in some way by sometimes abolition was a gradual process a few hundred people were enslaved in the Northern states as late as the Census Some slaveowners primarily in the Upper South freed their slaves and philanthropists and charitable groups bought and freed others The Atlantic slave trade was outlawed by individual states beginning during the American Revolution The import trade was banned by Congress in although smuggling was common thereafter It has been estimated that about of congressmen who were born before were at some time in their lives owners of slaves
The rapid expansion of the cotton industry in the Deep South after the invention of the cotton gin greatly increased demand for slave labor and the Southern states continued as slave societies The United States became ever more polarized over the issue of slavery split into slave and free states Driven by labor demands from new cotton plantations in the Deep South the Upper South sold more than a million slaves who were taken to the Deep South The total slave population in the South eventually reached four million As the United States expanded the Southern states attempted to extend slavery into the new western territories to allow proslavery forces to maintain their power in the country The new territories acquired by the Louisiana Purchase and the Mexican Cession were the subject of major political crises and compromises By the newly rich cotton growing South was threatening to secede from the Union and tensions continued to rise Bloody fighting broke out over slavery in the Kansas Territory Slavery was defended in the South as a positive good and the largest religious denominations split over the slavery issue into regional organizations of the North and South
When Abraham Lincoln won the election on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery seven slave states seceded to form the Confederacy Shortly afterward the Civil War began on April when Confederate forces attacked the U S Army's Fort Sumter in Charleston South Carolina Four additional slave states then joined the confederacy after Lincoln on April called forth in response the militia of the several States of the Union to the aggregate number of seventy five thousand in order to suppress the rebellion During the war some jurisdictions abolished slavery and due to Union measures such as the Confiscation Acts and the Emancipation Proclamation the war effectively ended slavery in most places After the Union victory the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified on December prohibiting slavery and involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime
In Juan Ponce de Le n established the Spanish settlement in Puerto Rico which used the native Ta nos for labor The Ta nos were largely exterminated by war overwork and diseases brought by the Spanish In to supplement the dwindling Ta no population the first enslaved African people were imported to Puerto Rico The abolition of Indian slavery in with the New Laws increased the demand for African slaves
A century and a half later the British conducted enslaving raids in what is now Georgia Tennessee North Carolina South Carolina Florida and possibly Alabama The Charles Town slave trade which included both trading and direct raids by colonists was the largest among the British colonies in North America Between and between and captive Native Americans were exported from South Carolina more than the number of Africans imported to the colonies of the future United States during the same period Additional enslaved Native Americans were exported from South Carolina to Virginia Pennsylvania New York Rhode Island and Massachusetts
The historian Alan Gallay says the trade in Indian slaves was at the center of the English empire's development in the American South The trade in Indian slaves was the most important factor affecting the South in the period to intertribal wars to capture slaves destabilized English colonies Spanish Florida and French Louisiana
The first Africans enslaved within continental North America arrived via Santo Domingo to the San Miguel de Gualdape colony most likely located in the Winyah Bay area of present day South Carolina founded by Spanish explorer Lucas V zquez de Ayll n in The ill fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership during which the enslaved people revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local Native Americans De Ayll n and many of the colonists died shortly afterward of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned The settlers and the enslaved people who had not escaped returned to Santo Domingo
On August St Augustine Florida was founded by the Spanish conquistador Don Pedro Menendez de Aviles and he brought three enslaved Africans with him During the th and th centuries St Augustine was the hub of the trade in enslaved people in Spanish Florida and the first permanent settlement in what would become the continental United States to include enslaved Africans The first birth of an enslaved African in what is now the United States was Agust n who was born in St Augustine in
In the early years of the Chesapeake Colonies Virginia and Maryland colonial officials found it difficult to attract and retain laborers under the harsh frontier conditions and there was a high mortality rate Most laborers came from Britain as indentured laborers signing contracts of indenture to pay with work for their passage their upkeep and their training usually on a farm The colonies had agricultural economies These indentured laborers were often young people who intended to become permanent residents In some cases convicted criminals were transported to the colonies as indentured laborers rather than being imprisoned The indentured laborers were not slaves but were required to work for four to seven years in Virginia to pay the cost of their passage and maintenance
The first Africans to reach the colonies that England was struggling to establish were a group of some enslaved people who arrived at Point Comfort Virginia near Jamestown in August brought by British privateers who had seized them from a captured Portuguese slave ship Colonists do not appear to have made indenture contracts for most Africans Although it is possible that some of them were freed after a certain period most of them remained enslaved for life The historian Ira Berlin noted that what he called the charter generation in the colonies was sometimes made up of mixed race men Atlantic Creoles who were indentured servants and whose ancestry was African and Iberian They were descendants of African women and Portuguese or Spanish men who worked in African ports as traders or facilitators in the trade of enslaved people The transformation of the status of Africans from indentured servitude to slaves in a racial caste that they could not leave or escape happened over the next generation
There were no laws regarding slavery early in Virginia's history but in a Virginia court sentenced John Punch an African to life in servitude after he attempted to flee his service The two whites with whom he fled were sentenced only to an additional year of their indenture and three years' service to the colony This marked the first de facto legal sanctioning of slavery in the English colonies and was one of the first legal distinctions made between Europeans and Africans
In the Massachusetts Bay Colony became the first colony to authorize slavery through enacted law Massachusetts passed the Body of Liberties which prohibited slavery in many instances but allowed people to be enslaved if they were captives of war if they sold themselves into slavery or were purchased elsewhere or if they were sentenced to slavery as punishment by the governing authority The Body of Liberties used the word strangers to refer to people bought and sold as slaves they were generally not English subjects Colonists came to equate this term with Native Americans and Africans
In John Casor a black indentured servant in colonial Virginia was the first man to be declared a slave in a civil case He had claimed to an officer that his master Anthony Johnson had held him past his indenture term Johnson himself was a free black who had arrived in Virginia in from Portuguese Angola A neighbor Robert Parker told Johnson that if he did not release Casor he would testify in court to this fact Under local laws Johnson was at risk for losing some of his headright lands for violating the terms of indenture Under duress Johnson freed Casor Casor entered into a seven years' indenture with Parker Feeling cheated Johnson sued Parker to repossess Casor A Northampton County Virginia court ruled for Johnson declaring that Parker illegally was detaining Casor from his rightful master who legally held him for the duration of his life
During the colonial period the status of enslaved people was affected by interpretations related to the status of foreigners in England England had no system of naturalizing immigrants to its island or its colonies Since persons of African origins were not English subjects by birth they were among those peoples considered foreigners and generally outside English common law The colonies struggled with how to classify people born to foreigners and subjects In Virginia Elizabeth Key Grinstead a mixed race woman successfully gained her freedom and that of her son in a challenge to her status by making her case as the baptized Christian daughter of the free Englishman Thomas Key Her attorney was an English subject which may have helped her case He was also the father of her mixed race son and the couple married after Key was freed
In shortly after the Elizabeth Key trial and similar challenges the Virginia royal colony approved a law adopting the principle of partus sequitur ventrem called partus for short stating that any children born in the colony would take the status of the mother A child of an enslaved mother would be born into slavery regardless if the father were a freeborn Englishman or Christian This was a reversal of common law practice in England which ruled that children of English subjects took the status of the father The change institutionalized the skewed power relationships between those who enslaved people and enslaved women freed white men from the legal responsibility to acknowledge or financially support their mixed race children and somewhat confined the open scandal of mixed race children and miscegenation to within the slave quarters
In King Charles II rechartered the Royal African Company it had initially been set up in as an English monopoly for the African slave and commodities trade In by statute the English parliament opened the trade to all English subjects The trade of enslaved people to the mid Atlantic colonies increased substantially in the s and by the African population in Virginia had increased to of total Maryland contained Africans of total In the early th century England passed Spain and Portugal to become the world's leading trader of enslaved people From the early th century British colonial merchants especially in Charleston South Carolina challenged the monopoly of the Royal African Company and Joseph Wragg and Benjamin Savage became the first independent traders of enslaved people to break through the monopoly by the s
The Virginia slave codes of further defined as slaves those people imported from nations that were not Christian Native Americans who were sold to colonists by other Native Americans from rival tribes or captured by Europeans during village raids were also defined as slaves This codified the earlier principle of non Christian foreigner enslavement
In the Georgia Trustees enacted a law prohibiting slavery in the new colony which had been established in to enable the worthy poor as well as persecuted European Protestants to have a new start Slavery was then legal in the other English colonies Neighboring South Carolina had an economy based on the use of enslaved labor The Georgia Trustees wanted to eliminate the risk of slave rebellions and make Georgia better able to defend against attacks from the Spanish to the south who offered freedom to escaped enslaved people James Edward Oglethorpe was the driving force behind the colony and the only trustee to reside in Georgia He opposed slavery on moral grounds as well as for pragmatic reasons and vigorously defended the ban on slavery against fierce opposition from Carolina merchants of enslaved people and land speculators
The Protestant Scottish highlanders who settled what is now Darien Georgia added a moral anti slavery argument which became increasingly rare in the South in their Petition of the Inhabitants of New Inverness By Georgia authorized slavery in the colony because it had been unable to secure enough indentured servants as laborers As economic conditions in England began to improve in the first half of the th century workers had no reason to leave especially to face the risks in the colonies
During most of the British colonial period slavery existed in all the colonies People enslaved in the North typically worked as house servants artisans laborers and craftsmen with the greater number in cities Many men worked on the docks and in shipping In more than of New York City households enslaved people the second highest proportion of any city in the colonies behind only Charleston South Carolina But enslaved people were also used as agricultural workers in farm communities including in areas of upstate New York and Long Island Connecticut and New Jersey By there were blacks in a population of million They were unevenly distributed There were in New England where they were of the population in the mid Atlantic colonies where they were of the population were in New York or and in the five Southern Colonies where they were of the population
The South developed an agricultural economy dependent on commodity crops Its planters rapidly acquired a significantly higher number and proportion of enslaved people in the population overall as its commodity crops were labor intensive Early on enslaved people in the South worked primarily on farms and plantations growing indigo rice and tobacco cotton did not become a major crop until after the s Before then long staple cotton was cultivated primarily on the Sea Islands of Georgia and South Carolina
The invention of the cotton gin in enabled the cultivation of short staple cotton in a wide variety of mainland areas leading to the development of large areas of the Deep South as cotton country in the th century Rice and tobacco cultivation were very labor intensive In about of South Carolina's population was enslaved Planters defined by historians in the Upper South as those who held or more slaves used enslaved workers to cultivate commodity crops They also worked in the artisanal trades on large plantations and in many Southern port cities The later wave of settlers in the th century who settled along the Appalachian Mountains and backcountry were backwoods subsistence farmers and they seldom held enslaved people
Some of the British colonies attempted to abolish the international slave trade fearing that the importation of new Africans would be disruptive Virginia bills to that effect were vetoed by the British Privy Council Rhode Island forbade the import of enslaved people in All of the colonies except Georgia had banned or limited the African slave trade by Georgia did so in Some of these laws were later repealed
About slaves were transported to the United States or of the twelve million slaves taken from Africa About of these persons were imported into the Thirteen Colonies before directly and the rest from the Caribbean
Slaves transported to the British colonies and United States
Total They constituted less than of the million enslaved people brought from Africa to the Americas The great majority of enslaved Africans were transported to sugar plantations in the Caribbean and to Portuguese Brazil As life expectancy was short their numbers had to be continually replenished Life expectancy was much higher in the United States and the enslaved population was successful in reproduction The number of enslaved people in the United States grew rapidly reaching million by the Census From to the rate of natural growth of North American enslaved people was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe and it was nearly twice as rapid as that of England
The number of enslaved and free blacks rose from free in the U S Census to or free in the U S Census a increase The white population grew from million to million an increase of due to high birth rates and million immigrants overwhelmingly from Europe and of whom arrived in the years The percentage of the black population dropped from to as follows of population of whom were enslaved of population of whom were enslaved
Louisiana was founded as a French colony Colonial officials in implemented Louis XIV of France's Code Noir which regulated the slave trade and the institution of slavery in New France and the French West Indies This resulted in a different pattern of slavery in Louisiana purchased in compared to the rest of the United States As written the Code Noir gave some rights to slaves including the right to marry Although it authorized and codified cruel corporal punishment against slaves under certain conditions it forbade slave owners from torturing them or separating married couples or separating young children from their mothers It also required the owners to instruct slaves in the Catholic faith
Together with a more permeable historic French system that allowed certain rights to gens de couleur libres free people of color who were often born to white fathers and their mixed race concubines a far higher percentage of African Americans in Louisiana were free as of the census in Louisiana compared to in Mississippi whose population was dominated by white Anglo Americans Most of Louisiana's third class of free people of color situated between the native born French and mass of African slaves lived in New Orleans The Louisiana free people of color were often literate and educated with a significant number owning businesses properties and even slaves Although Code Noir forbade interracial marriages interracial unions were widespread Whether there was a formalized system of concubinage known as pla age is subject to debate The mixed race offspring Creoles of color from these unions were among those in the intermediate social caste of free people of color The English colonies in contrast operated within a binary system that treated mulatto and black slaves equally under the law and discriminated against equally if free But many free people of African descent were mixed race
When the U S took over Louisiana Americans from the Protestant South entered the territory and began to impose their norms They officially discouraged interracial relationships although white men continued to have unions with black women both enslaved and free The Americanization of Louisiana gradually resulted in a binary system of race causing free people of color to lose status as they were grouped with the slaves They lost certain rights as they became classified by American whites as officially black
As historian Christopher L Brown put it slavery had never been on the agenda in a serious way before but the American Revolution forced it to be a public question from there forward
While a small number of African slaves were kept and sold in England and Scotland slavery in England had not been authorized by statute there though it had in Scotland In in the case of Somerset v Stewart it was found that slavery was no part of the common law in England and Wales The British role in the international slave trade continued until it abolished its slave trade in Slavery flourished in most of Britain's North American and Caribbean colonies with many wealthy slave owners living in England and wielding considerable power
In early Lord Dunmore royal governor of Virginia and a slave owner wrote to Lord Dartmouth of his intent to free slaves owned by patriots in case of rebellion On November Lord Dunmore issued Lord Dunmore's Proclamation which declared martial law in Virginia and promised freedom for any slaves of American patriots who would leave their masters and join the royal forces Slaves owned by Loyalist masters however were unaffected by Dunmore's Proclamation About slaves owned by patriots escaped and joined Dunmore's forces Most died of disease before they could do any fighting Three hundred of these freed slaves made it to freedom in Britain
Many slaves used the very disruption of war to escape their plantations and fade into cities or woods or to the British lines Upon their first sight of British vessels thousands of slaves in Maryland and Virginia ran away from their owners Throughout the South losses of slaves were high with many due to escapes Slaves also escaped throughout New England and the mid Atlantic with many joining the British who had occupied New York In the closing months of the war the British evacuated freedmen and also removed slaves owned by loyalists Around Black Loyalists left with the British most of them ending up as free people in England or its colonies More than were resettled in Nova Scotia where they were eventually granted land and formed the community of the Black Nova Scotians
The rebels began to offer freedom as an incentive to motivate slaves to fight on their side Washington authorized slaves to be freed who fought with the American Continental Army Rhode Island started enlisting slaves in and promised compensation to owners whose slaves enlisted and survived to gain freedom During the course of the war about one fifth of the Northern army was black In Baron Closen a German officer in the French Royal Deux Ponts Regiment at the Battle of Yorktown estimated the American army to be about one quarter black These men included both former slaves and free born blacks Thousands of free blacks in the Northern states fought in the state militias and Continental Army In the South both sides offered freedom to slaves who would perform military service Roughly slaves fought in the American Revolution
In the first two decades after the American Revolution state legislatures and individuals took actions to free slaves Northern states passed new constitutions that contained language about equal rights or specifically abolished slavery some states such as New York and New Jersey where slavery was more widespread passed laws by the end of the th century to abolish slavery incrementally By all the Northern states had passed laws outlawing slavery either immediately or over time In New York the last slaves were freed in celebrated with a big July parade Indentured servitude temporary slavery which had been widespread in the colonies half the population of Philadelphia had once been indentured servants dropped dramatically and disappeared by However there were still forcibly indentured servants in New Jersey in No Southern state abolished slavery but some individual owners more than a handful freed their slaves by personal decision often providing for manumission in wills but sometimes filing deeds or court papers to free individuals Numerous slaveholders who freed their slaves cited revolutionary ideals in their documents others freed slaves as a promised reward for service From to the proportion of blacks free in the United States increased from to percent and in the Upper South from less than one to nearly ten percent as a result of these actions
Starting in the rebels outlawed the importation of slaves state by state They all acted to end the international trade but after the war it was reopened in South Carolina and Georgia In the United States Congress acted on President Thomas Jefferson's advice and without controversy made importing slaves from abroad a federal crime effective the first day that the United States Constitution permitted this prohibition January
During the Revolution and in the following years all states north of Maryland took steps towards abolishing slavery In the Vermont Republic which was still unrecognized by the United States passed a state constitution prohibiting slavery The Pennsylvania Abolition Society led in part by Benjamin Franklin was founded in and in Pennsylvania began gradual abolition In the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled in Commonwealth v Jennison that slavery was unconstitutional under the state's new constitution New Hampshire began gradual emancipation in while Connecticut and Rhode Island followed in The New York Manumission Society was founded in and was led by John Jay Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr New York state began gradual emancipation in and New Jersey followed in
Shortly after the Revolution the Northwest Territory was established by Manasseh Cutler and Rufus Putnam who had been George Washington's chief engineer Both Cutler and Putnam came from Puritan New England The Puritans strongly believed that slavery was morally wrong Their influence on the issue of slavery was long lasting and this was provided significantly greater impetus by the Revolution The Northwest Territory which became Ohio Michigan Indiana Illinois Wisconsin and part of Minnesota doubled the size of the United States and it was established at the insistence of Cutler and Putnam as free soil no slavery This was to prove crucial a few decades later Had those states been slave states and their electoral votes gone to Abraham Lincoln's main opponent Lincoln would not have become President The Civil War would not have been fought Even if it eventually had been the North might well have lost
Slavery was a contentious issue in the writing and approval of the Constitution of the United States The words slave and slavery did not appear in the Constitution as originally adopted although several provisions clearly referred to slaves and slavery Until the adoption of the th Amendment in the Constitution did not prohibit slavery
Section of Article I forbade the Federal government from preventing the importation of slaves described as such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit for twenty years after the Constitution's ratification until January The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves of adopted by Congress and signed into law by President Thomas Jefferson who had called for its enactment in his State of the Union address went into effect on January the earliest date on which the importation of slaves could be prohibited under the Constitution
The delegates approved Section of Article IV which prohibited states from freeing slaves who fled to them from another state and required the return of chattel property to owners The Fugitive Slave Act of gave effect to the Fugitive Slave Clause of the Constitution
In a section negotiated by James Madison of Virginia Section of Article I designated other persons slaves to be added to the total of the state's free population at the rate of three fifths of their total number to establish the state's official population for the purposes of apportionment of Congressional representation and federal taxation The Three Fifths Compromise was reached after a debate in which delegates from Southern slaveholding states argued that slaves should be counted in the census just as all other persons were while delegates from Northern free states countered that slaves should not be counted at all The compromise strengthened the political power of Southern states as three fifths of the non voting slave population was counted for congressional apportionment and in the Electoral College although it did not strengthen Southern states as much as it would have had the Constitution provided for counting all persons whether slave or free equally
In addition many parts of the country were tied to the Southern economy As the historian James Oliver Horton noted prominent slaveholder politicians and the commodity crops of the South had a strong influence on United States politics and economy Horton said
in the years between the election of George Washington and the election of Abraham Lincoln of those years had a slaveholder as president of the United States and for that whole period of time there was never a person elected to a second term who was not a slaveholder The power of Southern states in Congress lasted until the Civil War affecting national policies legislation and appointments One result was that justices appointed to the Supreme Court were also primarily slave owners The planter elite dominated the Southern congressional delegations and the United States presidency for nearly fifty years
The U S Constitution barred the federal government from prohibiting the importation of slaves for twenty years Various states passed bans on the international slave trade during that period by the only state still allowing the importation of African slaves was South Carolina After legal importation of slaves ceased although there was smuggling via Spanish Florida and the disputed Gulf Coast to the west This route all but ended after Florida became a U S territory in but see Wanderer and Clotilda
The replacement for the importation of slaves from abroad was increased domestic production Virginia and Maryland had little new agricultural development and their need for slaves was mostly for replacements for decedents Normal reproduction more than supplied these Virginia and Maryland had surpluses of slaves Their tobacco farms were worn out and the climate was not suitable for cotton or sugar cane The surplus was even greater because slaves were encouraged to reproduce though they could not marry The pro slavery Virginian Thomas Roderick Dew wrote in that Virginia was a negro raising state i e Virginia produced slaves According to him in Virginia exported upwards of slaves per year a source of wealth to Virginia A newspaper from gives the figure as earning for Virginia an estimated per year Demand for slaves was the strongest in what was then the southwest of the country Alabama Mississippi and Louisiana and later Texas Arkansas and Missouri Here there was abundant land suitable for plantation agriculture which young men with some capital established This was expansion of the white monied population younger men seeking their fortune
The most valuable crop that could be grown on a plantation in that climate was cotton That crop was labor intensive and the least costly laborers were slaves Demand for slaves exceeded the supply in the southwest therefore slaves never cheap if they were productive went for a higher price As portrayed in Uncle Tom's Cabin the original cabin was in Maryland selling South was greatly feared A recently publicized example of the practice of selling South is the sale by Jesuits of slaves from Maryland to plantations in Louisiana to benefit Georgetown University which has been described as ow ing its existence to this transaction
Traders responded to the demand including John Armfield and his uncle Isaac Franklin who were reputed to have made over half a million dollars in th century value in the slave trade
In the United States in the early th century owners of female slaves could freely and legally use them as sexual objects This follows free use of female slaves on slaving vessels by the crews
The slaveholder has it in his power to violate the chastity of his slaves And not a few are beastly enough to exercise such power Hence it happens that in some families it is difficult to distinguish the free children from the slaves It is sometimes the case that the largest part of the master's own children are born not of his wife but of the wives and daughters
of his slaves whom he has basely prostituted as well as enslaved
This vice this bane of society has already become so common that it is scarcely esteemed a disgrace
Fancy was a code word which indicated that the girl or young woman was suitable for or trained for sexual use In some cases children were also abused in this manner The sale of a year old nearly a fancy is documented Zephaniah Kingsley Jr bought his wife when she was
Furthermore enslaved women who were old enough to bear children were encouraged to procreate which raised their value as slaves since their children would eventually provide labor or be sold enriching the owners Enslaved women were sometimes medically treated in order to enable or encourage their fertility The variations in skin color found in the United States make it obvious how often black women were impregnated by whites For example in the Census of free negros in Florida were described as mulattos of mixed race Nevertheless it is only very recently with DNA studies that any sort of reliable number can be provided and the research has only begun Light skinned girls who contrasted with the darker field workers were preferred
As it was put by Caroline Randall Williams in the New York Times You Want a Confederate Monument My Body Is a Confederate Monument I have rape colored skin she added
The sexual use of black slaves by either slave owners or by those who could purchase the temporary services of a slave took various forms A slaveowner or his teenage son could go to the slave quarters area of the plantation and do what he wanted with minimal privacy if any It was common for a house female housekeeper maid cook laundress or nanny to be raped by one or more members of the household Houses of prostitution throughout the slave states were largely staffed by female slaves providing sexual services to their owners' profit There were a small number of free black females engaged in prostitution or concubinage especially in New Orleans
Slave owners who engaged in sexual activity with female slaves were often the elite of the community They had little need to worry about public scorn These relationships appear to have been tolerated and in some cases even quietly accepted Southern women do not trouble themselves about it Franklin and Armfield who were definitely the elite of the community joked frequently in their letters about the black women and girls that they were raping It never occurred to them that there was anything wrong in what they were doing
Light skinned young girls were sold openly for sexual use their price was much higher than that of a field hand Special markets for the fancy girl trade existed in New Orleans and Lexington Kentucky Historian Philip Shaw describes an occasion when Abraham Lincoln and Allen Gentry witnessed such sales in New Orleans in
Those girls who were considered educated and refined were purchased by the wealthiest clients usually plantation owners to become personal sexual companions There was a great demand in New Orleans for 'fancy girls'
The issue which did come up frequently was the threat of sexual intercourse between black males and white females Just as the black women were perceived as having a trace of Africa that supposedly incited passion and sexual wantonness the men were perceived as savages unable to control their lust given an opportunity
Another approach to the question was offered by Quaker and Florida planter Zephaniah Kingsley Jr He advocated and personally practiced deliberate racial mixing through marriage as part of his proposed solution to the slavery issue racial integration called amalgamation at the time In an Treatise he stated that mixed race people were healthier and often more beautiful that interracial sex was hygienic and slavery made it convenient Because of these views tolerated in Spanish Florida he found it impossible to remain long in Territorial Florida and moved with his slaves and multiple wives to a plantation Mayorasgo de Koka in Haiti now in the Dominican Republic There were many others who less flagrantly practiced interracial common law marriages with slaves see Partus sequitur ventrem
In the th century proponents of slavery often defended the institution as a necessary evil At that time it was feared that emancipation of black slaves would have more harmful social and economic consequences than the continuation of slavery On April Thomas Jefferson one of the Founding Fathers of the United States wrote in a letter to John Holmes that with slavery
The French writer and traveler Alexis de Tocqueville in his influential Democracy in America expressed opposition to slavery while observing its effects on American society He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights for example in northern states He believed that the attitudes of white Southerners and the concentration of the black population in the South were bringing the white and black populations to a state of equilibrium and were a danger to both races Because of the racial differences between master and slave he believed that the latter could not be emancipated
In a letter to his wife dated December in reaction to a message from President Franklin Pierce Robert E Lee wrote
However as the abolitionist movement's agitation increased and the area developed for plantations expanded apologies for slavery became more faint in the South Leaders then described slavery as a beneficial scheme of labor management John C Calhoun in a famous speech in the Senate in declared that slavery was instead of an evil a good a positive good Calhoun supported his view with the following reasoning in every civilized society one portion of the community must live on the labor of another learning science and the arts are built upon leisure the African slave kindly treated by his master and mistress and looked after in his old age is better off than the free laborers of Europe and under the slave system conflicts between capital and labor are avoided The advantages of slavery in this respect he concluded will become more and more manifest if left undisturbed by interference from without as the country advances in wealth and numbers
South Carolina army officer planter and railroad executive James Gadsden called slavery a social blessing and abolitionists the greatest curse of the nation Gadsden was in favor of South Carolina's secession in and was a leader in efforts to split California into two states one slave and one free
Other Southern writers who also began to portray slavery as a positive good were James Henry Hammond and George Fitzhugh They presented several arguments to defend the practice of slavery in the South Hammond like Calhoun believed that slavery was needed to build the rest of society In a speech to the Senate on March Hammond developed his Mudsill Theory defending his view on slavery by stating Such a class you must have or you would not have that other class which leads progress civilization and refinement It constitutes the very mud sill of society and of political government and you might as well attempt to build a house in the air as to build either the one or the other except on this mud sill Hammond believed that in every class one group must accomplish all the menial duties because without them the leaders in society could not progress He argued that the hired laborers of the North were slaves too The difference is that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated there is no starvation no begging no want of employment while those in the North had to search for employment
George Fitzhugh used assumptions about white superiority to justify slavery writing that the Negro is but a grown up child and must be governed as a child In The Universal Law of Slavery Fitzhugh argues that slavery provides everything necessary for life and that the slave is unable to survive in a free world because he is lazy and cannot compete with the intelligent European white race He states that The negro slaves of the South are the happiest and in some sense the freest people in the world Without the South He slave would become an insufferable burden to society and Society has the right to prevent this and can only do so by subjecting him to domestic slavery
On March Alexander Stephens Vice President of the Confederacy delivered his Cornerstone Speech He explained the differences between the Constitution of the Confederate States and the United States Constitution laid out the cause for the American Civil War as he saw it and defended slavery
This view of the Negro race was backed by pseudoscience The leading researcher was Dr Samuel A Cartwright inventor of the mental illnesses of drapetomania the desire of a slave to run away and dysaesthesia aethiopica rascality both cured by whipping The Medical Association of Louisiana set up a committee of which he was chair to investigate the Diseases and Physical Peculiarities of the Negro Race Their report first delivered to the Medical Association in an address was published in their journal and then reprinted in part in the widely circulated DeBow's Review
Whether or not slavery was to be limited to the Southern states that already had it or whether it was to be permitted in new states made from the lands of the Louisiana Purchase and Mexican Cession was a major issue in the s and s Results included the Compromise of and the Bleeding Kansas period
Also relatively well known are the proposals including the Ostend Manifesto to annex Cuba as a slave state There was also talk of making slave states of Mexico Nicaragua see Walker affair and other lands around the so called Golden Circle Less well known today though well known at the time is that pro slavery Southerners
Spoke openly of their desire to reopen the Atlantic slave trade see Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves Antebellum proposals by Fire Eaters to reopen
Wanted to reintroduce slavery in the Northern states through federal action or Constitutional amendment making slavery legal nationwide thus overriding state anti slavery laws See Crittenden Compromise This was described as well underway by
Said openly that slavery should by no means be limited to Negros since in their view it was beneficial Northern white workers who were allegedly wage slaves already would allegedly have better lives if they were enslaved None of these ideas got very far but they alarmed Northerners and contributed to the growing polarization of the country
Beginning during the Revolution and in the first two decades of the postwar era every state in the North abolished slavery These were the first abolitionist laws in the Atlantic World However the abolition of slavery did not necessarily mean that existing slaves became free In some states they were forced to remain with their former owners as indentured servants free in name only although they could not be sold and thus families could not be split and their children were born free The end of slavery did not come in New York until July when it was celebrated with a big parade However in the census the only state with no slaves was Vermont In the census there were still slaves in New Hampshire Rhode Island Connecticut New York Pennsylvania Ohio Indiana Illinois Iowa and Wisconsin There were none in these states in the census
In Massachusetts slavery was successfully challenged in court in in a freedom suit by Quock Walker he said that slavery was in contradiction to the state's new constitution of providing for equality of men Freed slaves were subject to racial segregation and discrimination in the North and in many cases they did not have the right to vote until ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in
Most Northern states passed legislation for gradual abolition first freeing children born to slave mothers and requiring them to serve lengthy indentures to their mother's owners often into their s as young adults In the Supreme Court of New Jersey received lengthy arguments towards the deliverance of four thousand persons from bondage Pennsylvania's last ex slaves were freed in Connecticut's in and while neither New Hampshire nor New Jersey had any slaves in the Census and New Jersey only one and New Hampshire none in the Census slavery was never prohibited in either state until ratification of the th Amendment in and New Jersey was one of the last states to ratify it
None of the Southern states abolished slavery before but it was not unusual for individual slaveholders in the South to free numerous slaves often citing revolutionary ideals in their wills Methodist Quaker and Baptist preachers traveled in the South appealing to slaveholders to manumit their slaves and there were manumission societies in some Southern states By the number and proportion of free blacks in the population of the United States had risen dramatically Most free blacks lived in the North but even in the Upper South the proportion of free blacks went from less than one percent of all blacks to more than ten percent even as the total number of slaves was increasing through imports
One of the early Puritan writings on this subject was The Selling of Joseph by Samuel Sewall in In it Sewall condemned slavery and the slave trade and refuted many of the era's typical justifications for slavery The Puritan influence on slavery was still strong at the time of the American Revolution and up until the Civil War Of America's first seven presidents the two who did not own slaves John Adams and John Quincy Adams came from Puritan New England They were wealthy enough to own slaves but they chose not to because they believed that it was morally wrong to do so In colonial leader Samuel Adams and his wife were given a slave girl as a gift They immediately freed her Just after the Revolution in the Northwest Territory which became the states of Ohio Michigan Indiana Illinois Wisconsin and part of Minnesota was opened up for settlement The two men responsible for establishing this territory were Manasseh Cutler and Rufus Putnam They came from Puritan New England and they insisted that this new territory which doubled the size of the United States was going to be free soil no slavery This was to prove crucial in the coming decades If those states had become slave states and their electoral votes had gone to Abraham Lincoln's main opponent Lincoln would not have been elected president The Civil War would not have been fought Even if it eventually had been the North would likely have lost
In the decades leading up to the Civil War the abolitionists such as Theodore Parker Ralph Waldo Emerson Henry David Thoreau and Frederick Douglass repeatedly used the Puritan heritage of the country to bolster their cause The most radical anti slavery newspaper The Liberator invoked the Puritans and Puritan values over a thousand times Parker in urging New England Congressmen to support the abolition of slavery wrote that The son of the Puritan is sent to Congress to stand up for Truth and Right
Northerners predominated in the westward movement into the Midwestern territory after the American Revolution as the states were organized they voted to prohibit slavery in their constitutions when they achieved statehood Ohio in Indiana in and Illinois in What developed was a Northern block of free states united into one contiguous geographic area that generally shared an anti slavery culture The exceptions were the areas along the Ohio River settled by Southerners the southern portions of Indiana Ohio and Illinois Residents of those areas generally shared in Southern culture and attitudes In addition these areas were devoted to agriculture longer than the industrializing northern parts of these states and some farmers used slave labor In Illinois for example while the trade in slaves was prohibited it was legal to bring slaves from Kentucky into Illinois and use them there as long as the slaves left Illinois one day per year they were visiting The emancipation of slaves in the North led to the growth in the population of Northern free blacks from several hundred in the s to nearly by
There was legal agitation against slavery in the Thirteen Colonies starting in by lawyer Benjamin Kent whose cases were recorded by one of his understudies the future president John Adams Kent represented numerous slaves in their attempts to gain their freedom He handled the case of a slave Pompey suing his master In Kent was the first lawyer in the United States to win a case to free a slave Jenny Slew He also won a trial in the Old County Courthouse for a slave named Ceasar Watson Kent also handled Lucy Pernam's divorce and the freedom suits of Rose and Salem Orne
Throughout the first half of the th century abolitionism a movement to end slavery grew in strength most abolitionist societies and supporters were in the North They worked to raise awareness about the evils of slavery and to build support for abolition
This struggle took place amid strong support for slavery among white Southerners who profited greatly from the system of enslaved labor But slavery was entwined with the national economy for instance the banking shipping and manufacturing industries of New York City all had strong economic interests in slavery as did similar industries in other major port cities in the North The Northern textile mills in New York and New England processed Southern cotton and manufactured clothes to outfit slaves By half of New York City's exports were related to cotton
Slaveholders began to refer to slavery as the peculiar institution to differentiate it from other examples of forced labor They justified it as less cruel than the free labor of the North
The principal organized bodies to advocate abolition and anti slavery reforms in the north were the Pennsylvania Abolition Society and the New York Manumission Society Before the s the antislavery groups called for gradual emancipation By the late s under the impulse of religious evangelicals such as Beriah Green the sense emerged that owning slaves was a sin and the owner had to immediately free himself from this grave sin by immediate emancipation
In the early part of the th century other organizations were founded to take action on the future of black Americans Some advocated removing free black people from the United States to places where they would enjoy greater freedom some endorsed colonization in Africa while others advocated emigration usually to Haiti During the s and s the American Colonization Society ACS was the primary organization to implement the return of black Americans to Africa The ACS was made up mostly of Quakers and slaveholders and they found uneasy common ground in support of what was incorrectly called repatriation By this time however most black Americans were native born and did not want to emigrate saying they were no more African than white Americans were British Rather they wanted full rights in the United States where their families had lived and worked for generations
In the ACS and affiliated state societies established what would become the colony of Liberia in West Africa The ACS assisted thousands of freedmen and free blacks with legislated limits to emigrate there from the United States Many white people considered this preferable to emancipation in the United States Henry Clay one of the founders and a prominent slaveholder politician from Kentucky said that blacks faced
unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country It was desirable therefore as it respected them and the residue of the population of the country to drain them off Deportation would also be a way to prevent reprisals against former slaveholders and white people in general as had occurred in the Haiti massacre After abolitionist and newspaper publisher William Lloyd Garrison promoted emancipation characterizing slaveholding as a personal sin He demanded that slaveowners repent and start the process of emancipation His position increased defensiveness on the part of some Southerners who noted the long history of slavery among many cultures A few abolitionists such as John Brown favored the use of armed force to foment uprisings among the slaves as he attempted to do at Harper's Ferry Most abolitionists tried to raise public support to change laws and to challenge slave laws Abolitionists were active on the lecture circuit in the North and often featured escaped slaves in their presentations Writer and orator Frederick Douglass became an important abolitionist leader after escaping from slavery Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin was an international bestseller and aroused popular sentiment against slavery It also provoked the publication of numerous anti Tom novels by Southerners in the years before the American Civil War
Under the Constitution Congress could not prohibit the import slave trade that was allowed in South Carolina until However the third Congress regulated against it in the Slave Trade Act of which prohibited American shipbuilding and outfitting for the trade Subsequent acts in and sought to discourage the trade by banning American investment in the trade and American employment on ships in the trade as well as prohibiting importation into states that had abolished slavery which most in the North had by that time The final Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves was adopted in effective in However illegal importation of African slaves smuggling was common The Cuban slave trade between and was dominated by American slave ships Despite the Act Rhode Island slave ship owners found ways to continue supplying the slave owning states The overall U S slave ship fleet in was estimated to be almost the size of that of the British
After Great Britain and the United States outlawed the international slave trade in British slave trade suppression activities began in through diplomatic efforts and the formation of the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron in The United States denied the Royal Navy the right to stop and search U S ships suspected as slave ships so not only were American ships unhindered by British patrols but slavers from other countries would fly the American flag to try to avoid being stopped Co operation between the United States and Britain was not possible during the War of or the period of poor relations in the following years In the United States Navy sent USS Cyane under the command of Captain Trenchard to patrol the slave coasts of West Africa Cyane seized four American slave ships in her first year on station Trenchard developed a good level of co operation with the Royal Navy Four additional U S warships were sent to the African coast in and A total of American slave ships were taken by the U S Navy over this period Then American enforcement activity reduced There was still no agreement between the United States and Britain on a mutual right to board suspected slave traders sailing under each other's flag Attempts to reach such an agreement stalled in and in the United States Senate A U S Navy presence however sporadic did result in American slavers sailing under the Spanish flag but still as an extensive trade The Webster Ashburton Treaty of set a guaranteed minimum level of patrol activity by the U S Navy and the Royal Navy and formalized the level of co operation that had existed in Its effects however were minimal while opportunities for greater co operation were not taken The U S transatlantic slave trade was not effectively suppressed until during Lincoln's presidency when a treaty with Britain was signed whose provisions included allowing the Royal Navy to board search and arrest slavers operating under the American flag
Although Virginia Maryland and Delaware were slave states the latter two already had a high proportion of free blacks by the outbreak of war Following the Revolution the three legislatures made manumission easier allowed by deed or will Quaker and Methodist ministers particularly urged slaveholders to free their slaves The number and proportion of freed slaves in these states rose dramatically until More than half of the number of free blacks in the United States were concentrated in the Upper South The proportion of free blacks among the black population in the Upper South rose from less than in to more than by In Delaware nearly of blacks were free by
In the United States as a whole the number of free blacks reached or of all blacks by After that period few slaves were freed as the development of cotton plantations featuring short staple cotton in the Deep South drove up the internal demand for slaves in the domestic slave trade and high prices being paid for them
South Carolina made manumission more difficult requiring legislative approval of every instance of manumission Several Southern states required manumitted slaves to leave the state within thirty days
The growing international demand for cotton led many plantation owners further west in search of suitable land In addition the invention of the cotton gin in enabled profitable processing of short staple cotton which could readily be grown in the uplands The invention revolutionized the cotton industry by increasing fifty fold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day At the end of the War of fewer than bales of cotton were produced nationally By the amount of cotton produced had increased to bales and by it had reached There was an explosive growth of cotton cultivation throughout the Deep South and greatly increased demand for slave labor to support it As a result manumissions decreased dramatically in the South
Most of the slaves sold from the Upper South were from Maryland Virginia and the Carolinas where changes in agriculture decreased the need for their labor and the demand for slaves Before primary destinations for the slaves who were sold were Kentucky and Tennessee but after the Deep South states of Georgia Alabama Mississippi Louisiana and Texas received the most slaves This is where cotton became king Meanwhile the Upper South states of Kentucky and Tennessee joined the slave exporting states
By the domestic slave trade had become a major economic activity in the United States it lasted until the s Between and nearly slaves were taken across state lines In the s more than enslaved persons were transported and historians estimate nearly one million in total took part in the forced migration of this new Middle Passage By the slave population in the United States had reached four million Of the free families in the fifteen slave states in nearly held slaves roughly one in four or amounting to of all American families
The historian Ira Berlin called this forced migration of slaves the Second Middle Passage because it reproduced many of the same horrors as the Middle Passage the name given to the transportation of slaves from Africa to North America These sales of slaves broke up many families and caused much hardship Characterizing it as the central event in the life of a slave between the American Revolution and the Civil War Berlin wrote that whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved the massive deportation traumatized black people both slave and free Individuals lost their connection to families and clans Added to the earlier colonists combining slaves from different tribes many ethnic Africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa Most were descended from families that had been in the United States for many generations
The firm of Franklin and Armfield was a leader in this trade In the s almost slaves were transported with Alabama and Mississippi receiving each During each decade between and at least slaves were moved from their state of origin In the final decade before the Civil War were transporteded Michael Tadman wrote in Speculators and Slaves Masters Traders and Slaves in the Old South that of inter regional migrations were the result of the sale of slaves In a slave child in the Upper South had a chance of being sold South by The death rate for the slaves on their way to their new destination across the American South was less than that suffered by captives shipped across the Atlantic Ocean but mortality nevertheless was higher than the normal death rate
Slave traders transported two thirds of the slaves who moved West Only a minority moved with their families and existing master Slave traders had little interest in purchasing or transporting intact slave families in the early years planters demanded only the young male slaves needed for heavy labor Later in the interest of creating a self reproducing labor force planters purchased nearly equal numbers of men and women Berlin wrote
The internal slave trade became the largest enterprise in the South outside the plantation itself and probably the most advanced in its employment of modern transportation finance and publicity The slave trade industry developed its own unique language with terms such as prime hands bucks breeding wenches and fancy girls coming into common use The expansion of the interstate slave trade contributed to the economic revival of once depressed seaboard states as demand accelerated the value of slaves who were subject to sale
Some traders moved their chattels by sea with Norfolk to New Orleans being the most common route but most slaves were forced to walk overland Others were shipped downriver from such markets as Louisville on the Ohio River and Natchez on the Mississippi Traders created regular migration routes served by a network of slave pens yards and warehouses needed as temporary housing for the slaves In addition other vendors provided clothes food and supplies for slaves As the trek advanced some slaves were sold and new ones purchased Berlin concluded In all the slave trade with its hubs and regional centers its spurs and circuits reached into every cranny of southern society Few southerners black or white were untouched
Once the trip ended slaves faced a life on the frontier significantly different from most labor in the Upper South Clearing trees and starting crops on virgin fields was harsh and backbreaking work A combination of inadequate nutrition bad water and exhaustion from both the journey and the work weakened the newly arrived slaves and produced casualties New plantations were located at rivers' edges for ease of transportation and travel Mosquitoes and other environmental challenges spread disease which took the lives of many slaves They had acquired only limited immunities to lowland diseases in their previous homes The death rate was so high that in the first few years of hewing a plantation out of the wilderness some planters preferred whenever possible to use rented slaves rather than their own
The harsh conditions on the frontier increased slave resistance and led owners and overseers to rely on violence for control Many of the slaves were new to cotton fields and unaccustomed to the sunrise to sunset gang labor required by their new life Slaves were driven much harder than when they had been in growing tobacco or wheat back East Slaves had less time and opportunity to improve the quality of their lives by raising their own livestock or tending vegetable gardens for either their own consumption or trade as they could in the East
In Louisiana French colonists had established sugar cane plantations and exported sugar as the chief commodity crop After the Louisiana Purchase in Americans entered the state and joined the sugar cultivation Between and planters bought slaves from the North and the number of slaves increased from fewer than to more than Planters preferred young males who represented two thirds of the slave purchases Dealing with sugar cane was even more physically demanding than growing cotton The largely young unmarried male slave force made the reliance on violence by the owners especially savage
New Orleans became nationally important as a slave market and port as slaves were shipped from there upriver by steamboat to plantations on the Mississippi River it also sold slaves who had been shipped downriver from markets such as Louisville By it had the largest slave market in North America It became the wealthiest and the fourth largest city in the nation based chiefly on the slave trade and associated businesses The trading season was from September to May after the harvest
Slave traders were men of low reputation even in the South In the presidential election candidate Andrew Jackson was strongly criticized by opponents as a slave trader who transacted in slaves in defiance of modern standards or morality
The treatment of slaves in the United States varied widely depending on conditions time and place but in general it was brutal especially on plantations Whippings and rape were routine The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves with children showing their own cruelty Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills Slaves were punished by whipping shackling hanging beating burning mutilation branding and imprisonment Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions but sometimes abuse was carried out to re assert the dominance of the master or overseer of the slave Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders conditions permitting abuses
William Wells Brown who escaped to freedom reported that on one plantation slave men were required to pick eighty pounds per day of cotton while women were required to pick seventy pounds if any slave failed in his or her quota they were subject to whip lashes for each pound they were short The whipping post stood next to the cotton scales A New York man who attended a slave auction in the mid th century reported that at least three quarters of the male slaves he saw at sale had scars on their backs from whipping By contrast small slave owning families had closer relationships between the owners and slaves this sometimes resulted in a more humane environment but was not a given
Historian Lawrence M Friedman wrote Ten Southern codes made it a crime to mistreat a slave Under the Louisiana Civil Code of art if a master was convicted of cruel treatment the judge could order the sale of the mistreated slave presumably to a better master Masters and overseers were seldom prosecuted under these laws No slave could give testimony in the courts
According to Adalberto Aguirre's research slaves were executed in the United States between the s and s Quick executions of innocent slaves as well as suspects typically followed any attempted slave rebellions as white militias overreacted with widespread killings that expressed their fears of rebellions or suspected rebellions
Although most slaves had lives that were very restricted in terms of their movements and agency exceptions existed to virtually every generalization for instance there were also slaves who had considerable freedom in their daily lives slaves allowed to rent out their labor and who might live independently of their master in cities slaves who employed white workers and slave doctors who treated upper class white patients After in response to the inability to import new slaves from Africa and in part to abolitionist criticism some slaveholders improved the living conditions of their slaves to encourage them to be productive and to try to prevent escapes It was part of a paternalistic approach in the antebellum era that was encouraged by ministers trying to use Christianity to improve the treatment of slaves Slaveholders published articles in Southern agricultural journals to share best practices in treatment and management of slaves they intended to show that their system was better than the living conditions of northern industrial workers
Medical care for slaves was limited in terms of the medical knowledge available to anyone It was generally provided by other slaves or by slaveholders' family members although sometimes plantation physicians like J Marion Sims were called by the owners to protect their investment by treating sick slaves Many slaves possessed medical skills needed to tend to each other and used folk remedies brought from Africa They also developed new remedies based on American plants and herbs
An estimated nine percent of slaves were disabled due to a physical sensory psychological neurological or developmental condition However slaves were often described as disabled if they were unable to work or bear a child and were often subjected to harsh treatment as a result
According to Andrew Fede an owner could be held criminally liable for killing a slave only if the slave he killed was completely submissive and under the master's absolute control For example in the North Carolina General Assembly defined the willful killing of a slave as criminal murder unless done in resisting or under moderate correction that is corporal punishment
Because of the power relationships at work slave women in the United States were at high risk for rape and sexual abuse Their children were repeatedly taken away from them and sold as farm animals usually they never saw each other again Many slaves fought back against sexual attacks and some died resisting Others carried psychological and physical scars from the attacks Sexual abuse of slaves was partially rooted in a patriarchal Southern culture that treated black women as property or chattel Southern culture strongly policed against sexual relations between white women and black men on the purported grounds of racial purity but by the late th century the many mixed race slaves and slave children showed that white men had often taken advantage of slave women Wealthy planter widowers notably such as John Wayles and his son in law Thomas Jefferson took slave women as concubines each had six children with his partner Elizabeth Hemings and her daughter Sally Hemings the half sister of Jefferson's late wife respectively Both Mary Chesnut and Fanny Kemble wives of planters wrote about this issue in the antebellum South in the decades before the Civil War Sometimes planters used mixed race slaves as house servants or favored artisans because they were their children or other relatives As a result of centuries of slavery and such relationships DNA studies have shown that the vast majority of African Americans also have historic European ancestry generally through paternal lines
While slaves' living conditions were poor by modern standards Robert Fogel argued that all workers free or slave during the first half of the th century were subject to hardship Unlike free individuals however enslaved people were far more likely to be underfed physically punished sexually abused or killed with no recourse legal or otherwise against those who perpetrated these crimes against them
To help regulate the relationship between slave and owner including legal support for keeping the slave as property states established slave codes most based on laws existing since the colonial era The code for the District of Columbia defined a slave as a human being who is by law deprived of his or her liberty for life and is the property of another
While each state had its own slave code many concepts were shared throughout the slave states According to the slave codes some of which were passed in reaction to slave rebellions teaching a slave to read or write was illegal This prohibition was unique to American slavery believed to reduce slaves forming aspirations that could lead to escape or rebellion Informal education occurred when white children taught slave companions what they were learning in other cases adult slaves learned from free artisan workers especially if located in cities where there was more freedom of movement
In Alabama slaves were not allowed to leave their master's premises without written consent or passes This was a common requirement in other states as well and locally run patrols known to slaves as pater rollers often checked the passes of slaves who appeared to be away from their plantations In Alabama slaves were prohibited from trading goods among themselves In Virginia a slave was not permitted to drink in public within one mile of his master or during public gatherings Slaves were not permitted to carry firearms in any of the slave states
Slaves were generally prohibited by law from associating in groups with the exception of worship services a reason why the Black Church is such a notable institution in black communities today Following Nat Turner's rebellion in which raised white fears throughout the South some states also prohibited or restricted religious gatherings of slaves or required that they be officiated by white men Planters feared that group meetings would facilitate communication among slaves that could lead to rebellion Slaves held private secret brush meetings in the woods
In Ohio an emancipated slave was prohibited from returning to the state in which he or she had been enslaved Other Northern states discouraged the settling of free blacks within their boundaries Fearing the influence of free blacks Virginia and other Southern states passed laws to require blacks who had been freed to leave the state within a year or sometimes less time unless granted a stay by an act of the legislature
The United States Constitution adopted in prevented Congress from completely banning the importation of slaves until although Congress regulated against the trade in the Slave Trade Act of and in subsequent Acts in and During and after the Revolution the states individually passed laws against importing slaves By contrast the states of Georgia and South Carolina reopened their trade due to demand by their upland planters who were developing new cotton plantations Georgia from until December and South Carolina from In that period Charleston traders imported about slaves more than were brought to South Carolina in the years before the Revolution Approximately were imported to Georgia
By January when Congress banned further imports South Carolina was the only state that still allowed importation of enslaved people The domestic trade became extremely profitable as demand rose with the expansion of cultivation in the Deep South for cotton and sugar cane crops Slavery in the United States became more or less self sustaining by natural increase among the current slaves and their descendants Maryland and Virginia viewed themselves as slave producers seeing producing slaves as resembling animal husbandry Workers including many children were relocated by force from the upper to the lower South
Despite the ban slave imports continued through smugglers bringing in slaves past the U S Navy's African Slave Trade Patrol to South Carolina and overland from Texas and Florida both under Spanish control Congress increased the punishment associated with importing slaves classifying it in as an act of piracy with smugglers subject to harsh penalties including death if caught After that it is unlikely that more than slaves were successfully landed in the United States But some smuggling of slaves into the United States continued until just before the start of the Civil War see slave ships Wanderer and Clotilda
During the War of British Royal Navy commanders of the blockading fleet were instructed to offer freedom to defecting American slaves as the Crown had during the Revolutionary War Thousands of escaped slaves went over to the Crown with their families Men were recruited into the Corps of Colonial Marines on occupied Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay Many freed American slaves were recruited directly into existing West Indian regiments or newly created British Army units The British later resettled a few thousand freed slaves to Nova Scotia Their descendants together with descendants of the black people resettled there after the Revolution have established the Black Loyalist Heritage Museum
Slaveholders primarily in the South had considerable loss of property as thousands of slaves escaped to the British lines or ships for freedom despite the difficulties The planters' complacency about slave contentment was shocked by seeing that slaves would risk so much to be free Afterward when some freed slaves had been settled at Bermuda slaveholders such as Major Pierce Butler of South Carolina tried to persuade them to return to the United States to no avail
The Americans protested that Britain's failure to return all slaves violated the Treaty of Ghent After arbitration by the Tsar of Russia the British paid in damages about million in today's money to Washington which reimbursed the slaveowners
Prior to the American Revolution masters and revivalists spread Christianity to slave communities supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel In the First Great Awakening of the mid th century Baptists and Methodists from New England preached a message against slavery encouraged masters to free their slaves converted both slaves and free blacks and gave them active roles in new congregations The first independent black congregations were started in the South before the Revolution in South Carolina and Georgia Believing that slavery was contrary to the ethics of Jesus Christian congregations and church clergy especially in the North played a role in the Underground Railroad especially Wesleyan Methodists Quakers and Congregationalists
Over the decades and with the growth of slavery throughout the South some Baptist and Methodist ministers gradually changed their messages to accommodate the institution After white Southerners argued for the compatibility of Christianity and slavery with a multitude of both Old and New Testament citations They promoted Christianity as encouraging better treatment of slaves and argued for a paternalistic approach In the s and s the issue of accepting slavery split the nation's largest religious denominations the Methodist Baptist and Presbyterian churches into separate Northern and Southern organizations see Methodist Episcopal Church South Southern Baptist Convention and Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America Schisms occurred such as that between the Wesleyan Methodist Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church
Southern slaves generally attended their masters' white churches where they often outnumbered the white congregants They were usually permitted to sit only in the back or in the balcony They listened to white preachers who emphasized the obligation of slaves to keep in their place and acknowledged the slave's identity as both person and property Preachers taught the master's responsibility and the concept of appropriate paternal treatment using Christianity to improve conditions for slaves and to treat them justly and fairly Col This included masters having self control not disciplining under anger not threatening and ultimately fostering Christianity among their slaves by example
Slaves also created their own religious observances meeting alone without the supervision of their white masters or ministers The larger plantations with groups of slaves numbering or more tended to be centers of nighttime meetings of one or several plantation slave populations These congregations revolved around a singular preacher often illiterate with limited knowledge of theology who was marked by his personal piety and ability to foster a spiritual environment African Americans developed a theology related to Biblical stories having the most meaning for them including the hope for deliverance from slavery by their own Exodus One lasting influence of these secret congregations is the African American spiritual
According to Herbert Aptheker there were few phases of ante bellum Southern life and history that were not in some way influenced by the fear of or the actual outbreak of militant concerted slave action
Historians in the th century identified to slave uprisings in U S and colonial history Those after include
Igbo Landing slave escape and mass suicide
Slave Revolt in the Cherokee NationIn Nat Turner a literate slave who claimed to have spiritual visions organized a slave rebellion in Southampton County Virginia it was sometimes called the Southampton Insurrection Turner and his followers killed nearly sixty white inhabitants mostly women and children Many of the men in the area were attending a religious event in North Carolina Eventually Turner was captured with other rebels who were subdued by the militia Turner and his followers were hanged and Turner's body was flayed In a frenzy of fear and retaliation the militia killed more than slaves who had not been involved in the rebellion Planters whipped hundreds of innocent slaves to ensure resistance was quelled
This rebellion prompted Virginia and other slave states to pass more restrictions on slaves and free people of color controlling their movement and requiring more white supervision of gatherings In North Carolina withdrew the franchise for free people of color and they lost their vote
In a feature unique to American slavery legislatures across the South enacted new laws to curtail the already limited rights of African Americans For example Virginia prohibited blacks free or slave from practicing preaching prohibited them from owning firearms and forbade anyone to teach slaves or free blacks how to read It specified heavy penalties for both student and teacher if slaves were taught including whippings or jail
E very assemblage of negroes for the purpose of instruction in reading or writing or in the night time for any purpose shall be an unlawful assembly Any justice may issue his warrant to any office or other person requiring him to enter any place where such assemblage may be and seize any negro therein and he or any other justice may order such negro to be punished with stripes Unlike in the South slave owners in Utah were required to send their slaves to school Black slaves did not have to spend as much time in school as Indian slaves
There were approximately slaves in New England in of inhabitants slaves lived in the Mid Atlantic States of inhabitants of whom lived in New York where they made up of the population By Virginia held in a total population of the State It was common in agriculture with a more massive presence in the South where climate was more propitious for widescale agricultural activity By slavery in the New England States was abolished in Massachusetts New Hampshire and Vermont and phased out in Rhode Island and Connecticut New York introduced gradual emancipation in completed in Pennsylvania abolished slavery during the War for Independence
Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman in their book Time on the Cross argued that the rate of return of slavery at the market price was close to ten percent a number close to investment in other assets The transition from indentured servants to slaves is cited to show that slaves offered greater profits to their owners A qualified consensus among economic historians and economists is that Slave agriculture was efficient compared with free agriculture Economies of scale effective management and intensive utilization of labor and capital made southern slave agriculture considerably more efficient than nonslave southern farming and it is the near universal consensus among economic historians and economists that slavery was not a system irrationally kept in existence by plantation owners who failed to perceive or were indifferent to their best economic interests
The relative price of slaves and indentured servants in the antebellum period did decrease Indentured servants became more costly with the increase in the demand of skilled labor in England At the same time slaves were mostly supplied from within the United States and thus language was not a barrier and the cost of transporting slaves from one state to another was relatively low However as in Brazil and Europe slavery at its end in the United States tended to be concentrated in the poorest regions of the United States with a qualified consensus among economists and economic historians concluding that the modern period of the South's economic convergence to the level of the North only began in earnest when the institutional foundations of the southern regional labor market were undermined largely by federal farm and labor legislation dating from the s
In the decades preceding the Civil War the black population of the United States experienced a rapid natural increase Unlike the trans Saharan slave trade with Africa the slave population transported by the Atlantic slave trade to the United States was sex balanced The slave population multiplied nearly fourfold between and despite the passage of the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves signed into law by President Thomas Jefferson in banning the international slave trade Thus it is also the universal consensus among modern economic historians and economists that slavery in the United States was not economically moribund on the eve of the Civil War In the s several historians among them Edward E Baptist Sven Beckert Walter Johnson and Calvin Schermerhorn have posited that slavery was integral in the development of American capitalism Other economic historians have rejected that thesis
Scholars disagree on how to quantify the efficiency of slavery In Time on the Cross Fogel and Engerman equate efficiency to total factor productivity TFP the output per average unit of input on a farm Using this measurement Southern farms that enslaved black people using the gang system were more efficient than Northern farms which used free labor Under the gang system groups of slaves perform synchronized tasks under the constant vigilance of an overseer Each group was like a part of a machine If perceived to be working below his capacity a slave could be punished Fogel argues that this kind of negative enforcement was not frequent and that slaves and free laborers had a similar quality of life however there is controversy on this last point A critique of Fogel and Engerman's view was published by Paul A David in
In a random survey of members of the Economic History Association sought to study the views of economists and economic historians on the debate The study found that percent of economists and percent of economic historians would generally agree that Slave agriculture was efficient compared with free agriculture Economies of scale effective management and intensive utilization of labor and capital made southern slave agriculture considerably more efficient than nonslave southern farming percent of the economists agreed without provisos while percent agreed when provisos were included in the statement On the other hand percent of economic historians and percent of economists disagreed with Fogel and Engerman's proposition that the material not psychological conditions of the lives of slaves compared favorably with those of free industrial workers in the decades before the Civil War
The U S has a capitalist economy so the price of slaves was determine by the law of supply and demand For example following bans on the import of slaves after the U K 's Slave Trade Act and the American Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves the prices for slaves increased The markets for the products produced by slaves also affected the price of slaves e g the price of slaves fell when the price of cotton fell in Anticipation of slavery's abolition also influenced prices During the Civil War the price for slave men in New Orleans dropped from in to by the city was captured by U S forces in the Spring of
Controlling for inflation prices of slaves rose dramatically in the six decades prior to the Civil War reflecting demand due to commodity cotton as well as use of slaves in shipping and manufacturing Although the prices of slaves relative to indentured servants declined both got more expensive Cotton production was rising and relied on the use of slaves to yield high profits Fogel and Engeman initially argued that if the Civil War had not happened the slave prices would have increased even more an average of more than fifty percent by
Prices reflected the characteristics of the slave such factors as sex age nature and height were all taken into account to determine the price of a slave Over the life cycle the price of enslaved women was higher than their male counterparts up to puberty age as they would likely bear children who their masters could sell as slaves and could be used as slave laborers Men around the age of were the most valued as they were at the highest level of productivity and still had a considerable life span If slaves had a history of fights or escapes their price was lowered reflecting what planters believed was risk of repeating such behavior Slave traders and buyers would examine a slave's back for whipping scars a large number of injuries would be seen as evidence of laziness or rebelliousness rather than the previous master's brutality and would lower the slave's price Taller male slaves were priced at a higher level as height was viewed as a proxy for fitness and productivity
While slavery brought profits in the short run discussion continues on the economic benefits of slavery in the long run In a random anonymous survey of members of the Economic History Association found that out of the forty propositions about American economic history that were surveyed the group of propositions most disputed by economic historians and economists were those about the postbellum economy of the American South along with the Great Depression The only exception was the proposition initially put forward by historian Gavin Wright that the modern period of the South's economic convergence to the level of the North only began in earnest when the institutional foundations of the southern regional labor market were undermined largely by federal farm and labor legislation dating from the s percent of economists percent with and percent without provisos and percent of historians percent with and percent without provisos agreed with this statement Wright has also argued that the private investment of monetary resources in the cotton industry among others delayed development in the South of commercial and industrial institutions There was little public investment in railroads or other infrastructure Wright argues that agricultural technology was far more developed in the South representing an economic advantage of the South over the North of the United States
In Democracy in America Alexis de Tocqueville noted that the colonies in which there were no slaves became more populous and more rich than those in which slavery flourished Economists Peter H Lindert and Jeffrey G Williamson in a pair of articles published in and found that despite the American South initially having per capita income roughly double that of the North in incomes in the South had declined by and continued to decline over the next four decades while the economies in New England and the Mid Atlantic states vastly expanded By per capita income in the South was well behind the Northeast and the national average Note this is also true in the early st century
Lindert and Williamson argue that this antebellum period is an example of what economists Daron Acemoglu Simon Johnson and James A Robinson call a reversal of fortune In his essay The Real History of Slavery economist Thomas Sowell reiterated and augmented the observation made by de Tocqueville by comparing slavery in the United States to slavery in Brazil He notes that slave societies reflected similar economic trends in those and other parts of the world suggesting that the trend Lindert and Williamson identify may have continued until the American Civil War
Sowell also notes in Ethnic America A History citing historians Clement Eaton and Eugene Genovese that three quarters of Southern white families owned no slaves at all Most slaveholders lived on farms rather than plantations and few plantations were as large as the fictional ones depicted in Gone with the Wind In The Real History of Slavery Sowell also notes in comparison to slavery in the Arab world and the Middle East where slaves were seldom used for productive purposes and China where the slaves consumed the entire output they created Sowell observes that many commercial slaveowners in the antebellum South tended to be spendthrift and many lost their plantations due to creditor foreclosures and in Britain profits by British slave traders only amounted to two percent of British domestic investment at the height of the Atlantic slave trade in the th century Sowell draws the following conclusion regarding the macroeconomic value of slavery
In short even though some individual slaveowners grew rich and some family fortunes were founded on the exploitation of slaves that is very different from saying that the whole society or even its non slave population as a whole was more economically advanced than it would have been in the absence of slavery What this means is that whether employed as domestic servants or producing crops or other goods millions suffered exploitation and dehumanization for no higher purpose than the aggrandizement of slaveowners Eric Hilt noted that while some historians have suggested slavery was necessary for the Industrial Revolution on the grounds that American slave plantations produced most of the raw cotton for the British textiles market and the British textiles market was the vanguard of the Industrial Revolution it is not clear if this is actually true there is no evidence that cotton could not have been mass produced by yeoman farmers rather than slave plantations if the latter had not existed as their existence tended to force yeoman farmers into subsistence farming and there is some evidence that they certainly could have The soil and climate of the American South were excellent for growing cotton so it is not unreasonable to postulate that farms without slaves could have produced substantial amounts of cotton even if they did not produce as much as the plantations did it could still have been enough to serve the demand of British producers Similar arguments have been made by other historians
Scholar Adrienne Davis articulates how the economics of slavery also can be defined as a sexual economy specifically focusing on how black women were expected to perform physical sexual and reproductive labor to provide a consistent enslaved workforce and increase the profits of white slavers Davis writes that black women were needed for their sexual and reproductive labor to satisfy the economic political and personal interest of white men of the elite class articulating that black women's reproductive capacity was important in the maintenance of the system of slavery due to its ability to perpetuate an enslaved workforce She is also drawing attention to black women's labor being needed to maintain the aristocracy of a white ruling class due to the intimate nature of reproduction and its potential for producing more enslaved peoples
Due to the institution of partus sequitur ventrem black women's wombs became the site where slavery was developed and transferred meaning that black women were not only used for their physical labor but for their sexual and reproductive labor as well
The rule that the children's status follows their mothers' was a foundational one for our economy It converted enslaved women's reproductive capacity into market capital This articulation by Davis illustrates how black women's reproductive capacity was commodified under slavery and that an analysis of the economic structures of slavery requires an acknowledgment of how pivotal black women's sexuality was in maintaining slavery's economic power Davis writes how black women performed labor under slavery writing black women were male when convenient and horrifically female when needed The fluctuating expectations of black women's gendered labor under slavery disrupted the white normative roles that were assigned to white men and white women This ungendering black women received under slavery contributed to the systemic dehumanization experienced by enslaved black women as they were unable to receive the expectations or experiences of either gender within the white binary
Davis's arguments addresses the fact that under slavery black women's sexuality became linked to the economic and public sphere making their intimate lives into public institutions Black women's physical labor was gendered as masculine under slavery when they were needed to yield more profit but their reproductive capacities and sexual labor was equally as important in maintaining white power over black communities and perpetuating an enslaved workforce This blurring of the line between the private and public sphere is another way Davis articulates how black women's sexuality and reproduction was commodified and exploited for capitalist gain as their private and intimate lives became disrupted by the violence at the hands of white men and their sexual capacities became an important part of the public marketplace and United States economy
Despite this the slave population transported by the Atlantic slave trade to the United States was sex balanced and most survived the passage Despite lacking legal recognition most slaves in the antebellum South lived in families unlike the trans Saharan slave trade with Africa which was overwhelmingly female and in which the majority died en route crossing the Sahara with the large majority of the minority of male African slaves dying as a result of crude castration procedures to produce eunuchs who were in demand as harem attendants
In Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act as part of the Compromise of which required law enforcement and citizens of free states to cooperate in the capture and return of slaves This met with considerable overt and covert resistance in free states and cities such as Philadelphia New York and Boston Refugees from slavery continued to flee the South across the Ohio River and other parts of the Mason Dixon line dividing North from South to the North and Canada via the Underground Railroad Some white Northerners helped hide former slaves from their former owners or helped them reach freedom in Canada
As part of the Compromise of Congress abolished the slave trade though not the ownership of slaves in the District of Columbia fearing this would happen Alexandria regional slave trading center and port successfully sought its removal from the District of Columbia and devolution to Virginia After Republicans argued that the Slave Power especially the pro slavery Democratic Party in the South controlled two of the three branches of the Federal government
The abolitionists realizing that the total elimination of slavery was unrealistic as an immediate goal worked to prevent the expansion of slavery into the western territories which eventually would be new states The Missouri Compromise the Compromise of and the Bleeding Kansas period dealt with whether new states would be slave or free or how that was to be decided Both sides were anxious about effects of these decisions on the balance of power in the Senate
After the passage of the Kansas Nebraska Act in border fighting broke out in the Kansas Territory where the question of whether it would be admitted to the Union as a slave or free state was left to the inhabitants Migrants from both free and slave states moved into the territory to prepare for the vote on slavery Abolitionist John Brown the most famous of the anti slavery immigrants was active in the fighting in Bleeding Kansas but so too were many white Southerners many from adjacent Missouri who opposed abolition
Abraham Lincoln's and the Republicans' political platform in was to stop slavery's expansion Historian James M McPherson says that in his famous House Divided speech in Lincoln said American republicanism can be purified by restricting the further expansion of slavery as the first step to putting it on the road to 'ultimate extinction ' Southerners took Lincoln at his word When he won the presidency they left the Union to escape the 'ultimate extinction' of slavery
With the development of slave and free states after the American Revolution and far flung commercial and military activities new situations arose in which slaves might be taken by masters into free states Most free states not only prohibited slavery but ruled that slaves brought and kept there illegally could be freed Such cases were sometimes known as transit cases Dred Scott and his wife Harriet Scott each sued for freedom in St Louis after the death of their master based on their having been held in a free territory the northern part of the Louisiana Purchase from which slavery was excluded under the terms of the Missouri Compromise Later the two cases were combined under Dred Scott's name Scott filed suit for freedom in and went through two state trials the first denying and the second granting freedom to the couple and by extension their two daughters who had also been held illegally in free territories For years Missouri state precedent had generally respected laws of neighboring free states and territories ruling for freedom in such transit cases where slaves had been held illegally in free territory But in the Dred Scott case the Missouri Supreme Court ruled against the slaves
After Scott and his team appealed the case to the U S Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B Taney in a sweeping decision denied Scott his freedom The decision decided held that a slave did not become free when taken into a free state Congress could not bar slavery from a territory and people of African descent imported into the United States and held as slaves or their descendants could never be citizens and thus had no status to bring suit in a U S court A state could not bar slaveowners from bringing slaves into that state Many Republicans including Abraham Lincoln considered the decision unjust and evidence that the Slave Power had seized control of the Supreme Court Anti slavery groups were enraged and slave owners encouraged escalating the tensions that led to civil war
The divisions became fully exposed with the presidential election The electorate split four ways The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery while the Republican Party denounced it The Northern Democrats said democracy required the people to decide on slavery locally state by state and territory by territory The Constitutional Union Party said the survival of the Union was at stake and everything else should be compromised
Lincoln the Republican won with a plurality of popular votes and a majority of electoral votes Lincoln however did not appear on the ballots of ten southern slave states Many slave owners in the South feared that the real intent of the Republicans was the abolition of slavery in states where it already existed and that the sudden emancipation of four million slaves would be disastrous for the slave owners and for the economy that drew its greatest profits from the labor of people who were not paid The slave owners feared that ending the balance could lead to the domination of the federal government by the northern free states This led seven southern states to secede from the Union When the Confederate Army attacked a U S Army installation at Fort Sumter the American Civil War began and four additional slave states seceded Northern leaders had viewed the slavery interests as a threat politically but with secession they viewed the prospect of a new Southern nation the Confederate States of America with control over the Mississippi River and parts of the West as politically unacceptable Most of all they could not accept this repudiation of American nationalism
The consequent American Civil War beginning in led to the end of chattel slavery in America Not long after the war broke out through a legal maneuver credited to Union General Benjamin F Butler a lawyer by profession slaves who came into Union possession were considered contraband of war General Butler ruled that they were not subject to return to Confederate owners as they had been before the war Soon word spread and many slaves sought refuge in Union territory desiring to be declared contraband Many of the contrabands joined the Union Army as workers or troops forming entire regiments of the U S Colored Troops Others went to refugee camps such as the Grand Contraband Camp near Fort Monroe or fled to northern cities General Butler's interpretation was reinforced when Congress passed the Confiscation Act of which declared that any property used by the Confederate military including slaves could be confiscated by Union forces
At the beginning of the war some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters By when it became clear that this would be a long war the question of what to do about slavery became more general The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production As Congressman George W Julian of Indiana put it in an speech in Congress the slaves cannot be neutral As laborers if not as soldiers they will be allies of the rebels or of the Union Julian and his fellow Radical Republicans put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual compensated emancipation and colonization Copperheads the border states and War Democrats opposed emancipation although the border states and War Democrats eventually accepted it as part of total war needed to save the Union
The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January In a single stroke it changed the legal status as recognized by the U S government of three million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from slave to free It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government by running away or through advances of federal troops the slave became legally and actually free Plantation owners realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army By June the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and had liberated all of the designated slaves
In Lincoln expressed the fear that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states He believed that to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game At first Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War Simon Cameron and Generals John C Fremont in Missouri and David Hunter in South Carolina Georgia and Florida to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats
Lincoln mentioned his Emancipation Proclamation to members of his cabinet on July Secretary of State William H Seward advised Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing the proclamation as to do otherwise would seem like our last shriek on the retreat In September the Battle of Antietam provided this opportunity and the subsequent War Governors' Conference added support for the proclamation Lincoln had already published a letter encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as necessary to save the Union Lincoln later said that slavery was somehow the cause of the war
On September Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation which provided that enslaved people in the states in rebellion against the United States on January shall be then thenceforward and forever free Lincoln issued his final Emancipation Proclamation on January In his letter to Hodges Lincoln explained his belief that
Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January was a powerful action that promised freedom for slaves in the Confederacy as soon as the Union armies reached them and authorized the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army The Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in the Union allied slaveholding states that bordered the Confederacy Since the Confederate States did not recognize the authority of President Lincoln and the proclamation did not apply in the border states at first the proclamation freed only those slaves who had escaped behind Union lines The proclamation made the abolition of slavery an official war goal that was implemented as the Union took territory from the Confederacy According to the Census of this policy would free nearly four million slaves or over of the total population of the United States
Based on the President's war powers the Emancipation Proclamation applied to territory held by Confederates at the time However the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty Lincoln played a leading role in getting the constitutionally required two thirds majority of both houses of Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment which made emancipation universal and permanent
Enslaved African Americans had not waited for Lincoln before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines From the early years of the war hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines especially in Union controlled areas such as Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in Virginia Tennessee from on the line of Sherman's march etc So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them where both adults and children learned to read and write The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations
In addition nearly African American men served with distinction in the Union forces as soldiers and sailors most were escaped slaves The Confederacy was outraged by armed black soldiers and refused to treat them as prisoners of war They murdered many as at the Fort Pillow Massacre and re enslaved others
On February the Arizona Organic Act abolished slavery in the newly formed Arizona Territory Tennessee and all of the border states except Kentucky and Delaware abolished slavery by early Thousands of slaves were freed by the operation of the Emancipation Proclamation as Union armies marched across the South Emancipation came to the remaining Southern slaves after the surrender of all Confederate troops in spring
In spite of the South's shortage of manpower until most Southern leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers However a few Confederates discussed arming slaves Finally in early General Robert E Lee said that black soldiers were essential and legislation was passed The first black units were in training when the war ended in April
Booker T Washington remembered Emancipation Day in early when he was a boy of in Virginia
The war ended on June and following that surrender the Emancipation Proclamation was enforced throughout remaining regions of the South that had not yet freed the slaves Slavery officially continued for a couple of months in other locations Federal troops arrived in Galveston Texas on June to enforce the emancipation The commemoration of that event Juneteenth National Independence Day has been declared a national holiday in
The Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery except as punishment for a crime had been passed by the Senate in April and by the House of Representatives in January
The amendment did not take effect until it was ratified by three fourths of the states which occurred on December when Georgia ratified it On that date the last enslaved Americans in the remaining two slave states of Kentucky and Delaware as well as the or so perpetual apprentices in New Jersey left from the very gradual emancipation process begun in were freed
The American historian R R Palmer opined that the abolition of slavery in the United States without compensation to the former slave owners was an annihilation of individual property rights without parallel in the history of the Western world Economic historian Robert E Wright argues that it would have been much cheaper with minimal deaths if the federal government had purchased and freed all the slaves rather than fighting the Civil War Another economic historian Roger Ransom writes that Gerald Gunderson compared compensated emancipation to the cost of the war and notes that the two are roughly the same order of magnitude to billion dollars Ransom also writes that compensated emancipation would have tripled federal outlays if paid over the period of years and was a program that had no political support within the United States during the s
Journalist Douglas A Blackmon reported in his Pulitzer Prize winning book Slavery By Another Name that many black persons were virtually enslaved under convict leasing programs which started after the Civil War Most Southern states had no prisons they leased convicts to businesses and farms for their labor and the lessee paid for food and board The incentives for abuse were satisfied
The continued involuntary servitude took various forms but the primary forms included convict leasing peonage and sharecropping with the latter eventually encompassing poor whites as well By the s whites constituted most of the sharecroppers in the South Mechanization of agriculture had reduced the need for farm labor and many black people left the South in the Great Migration Jurisdictions and states created fines and sentences for a wide variety of minor crimes and used these as an excuse to arrest and sentence black people Under convict leasing programs African American men often guilty of no crime at all were arrested compelled to work without pay repeatedly bought and sold and coerced to do the bidding of the leaseholder Sharecropping as it was practiced during this period often involved severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of sharecroppers who could be whipped for leaving the plantation Both sharecropping and convict leasing were legal and tolerated by both the North and South However peonage was an illicit form of forced labor Its existence was ignored by authorities while thousands of African Americans and poor Anglo Americans were subjugated and held in bondage until the mid s to the late s With the exception of cases of peonage beyond the period of Reconstruction the federal government took almost no action to enforce the th Amendment until December when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt summoned his attorney general Five days after the attack on Pearl Harbor at the request of the President Attorney General Francis Biddle issued Circular No to all federal prosecutors instructing them to actively investigate and try any case of involuntary servitude or slavery Several months later convict leasing was officially abolished But aspects have persisted in other forms Historians argue that other systems of penal labor were all created in and convict leasing was simply the most oppressive form Over time a large civil rights movement arose to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans
With emancipation a legal reality white Southerners were concerned with both controlling the newly freed slaves and keeping them in the labor force at the lowest level The system of convict leasing began during Reconstruction and was fully implemented in the s and officially ending in the last state Alabama in It persisted in various forms until it was abolished in by President Franklin D Roosevelt during World War II several months after the attack on Pearl Harbor involved the U S in the conflict This system allowed private contractors to purchase the services of convicts from the state or local governments for a specific time period African Americans due to vigorous and selective enforcement of laws and discriminatory sentencing made up the vast majority of the convicts leased Writer Douglas A Blackmon writes of the system
The constitutional basis for convict leasing is that the Thirteenth Amendment while abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude generally expressly permits it as a punishment for crime
The anti literacy laws after contributed greatly to the problem of widespread illiteracy facing the freedmen and other African Americans after Emancipation and the Civil War years later The problem of illiteracy and need for education was seen as one of the greatest challenges confronting these people as they sought to join the free enterprise system and support themselves during Reconstruction and thereafter
Consequently many black and white religious organizations former Union Army officers and soldiers and wealthy philanthropists were inspired to create and fund educational efforts specifically for the betterment of African Americans some African Americans had started their own schools before the end of the war Northerners helped create numerous normal schools such as those that became Hampton University and Tuskegee University to generate teachers as well as other colleges for former slaves Blacks held teaching as a high calling with education the first priority for children and adults Many of the most talented went into the field Some of the schools took years to reach a high standard but they managed to get thousands of teachers started As W E B Du Bois noted the black colleges were not perfect but in a single generation they put thirty thousand black teachers in the South and wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of black people in the land
Northern philanthropists continued to support black education in the th century even as tensions rose within the black community exemplified by Booker T Washington and W E B Du Bois as to the proper emphasis between industrial and classical academic education at the college level An example of a major donor to Hampton Institute and Tuskegee was George Eastman who also helped fund health programs at colleges and in communities Collaborating with Washington in the early decades of the th century philanthropist Julius Rosenwald provided matching funds for community efforts to build rural schools for black children He insisted on white and black cooperation in the effort wanting to ensure that white controlled school boards made a commitment to maintain the schools By the s local parents had helped raise funds sometimes donating labor and land to create over rural schools in the South Other philanthropists such as Henry H Rogers and Andrew Carnegie each of whom had arisen from modest roots to become wealthy used matching fund grants to stimulate local development of libraries and schools
On February the Virginia General Assembly passed House Joint Resolution Number acknowledging with profound regret the involuntary servitude of Africans and the exploitation of Native Americans and call for reconciliation among all Virginians With the passing of this resolution Virginia became the first state to acknowledge through the state's governing body their state's negative involvement in slavery The passing of this resolution was in anticipation of the th anniversary commemoration of the founding of Jamestown Virginia the first permanent English settlement in North America which was an early colonial slave port Apologies have also been issued by Alabama Florida Maryland North Carolina and New Jersey
On July during the th United States Congress session the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution 'HR ' apologizing for American slavery and subsequent discriminatory laws
The U S Senate unanimously passed a similar resolution on June apologizing for the fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery It also explicitly states that it cannot be used for restitution claims
A study published in The Journal of Politics finds that Whites who currently live in Southern counties that had high shares of slaves in are more likely to identify as a Republican oppose affirmative action and express racial resentment and colder feelings toward blacks The study contends that contemporary differences in political attitudes across counties in the American South in part trace their origins to slavery's prevalence more than years ago The authors argue that their findings are consistent with the theory that following the Civil War Southern whites faced political and economic incentives to reinforce existing racist norms and institutions to maintain control over the newly freed African American population This amplified local differences in racially conservative political attitudes which in turn have been passed down locally across generations
A study in the British Journal of Political Science argued that the British American colonies without slavery adopted better democratic institutions in order to attract migrant workers to their colonies
During the th and th centuries Native American slavery the enslavement of Native Americans by European colonists was common Many of these Native slaves were exported to the Northern colonies and to off shore colonies especially the sugar islands of the Caribbean The exact number of Native Americans who were enslaved is unknown because vital statistics and census reports were at best infrequent Historian Alan Gallay estimates that from to British slave traders sold between and Native Americans from what is now the southern part of the U S Andr s Res ndez estimates that between and Native Americans were enslaved in North America excluding Mexico Even after the Indian Slave Trade ended in the enslavement of Native Americans continued in the west and also in the Southern states mostly through kidnappings
Slavery of Native Americans was organized in colonial and Mexican California through Franciscan missions theoretically entitled to ten years of Native labor but in practice maintaining them in perpetual servitude until their charge was revoked in the mid s Following the invasion by U S troops the loitering or orphaned Indians were de facto enslaved in the new state from statehood in to Slavery required the posting of a bond by the slave holder and enslavement occurred through raids and a four month servitude imposed as a punishment for Indian vagrancy
After some of the Cherokee and the other four civilized tribes of the Southeast started buying and using black slaves as labor They continued this practice after removal to Indian Territory in the s when as many as enslaved blacks were taken with them
The nature of slavery in Cherokee society often mirrored that of white slave owning society The law barred intermarriage of Cherokees and enslaved African Americans but Cherokee men had unions with enslaved women resulting in mixed race children Cherokee who aided slaves were punished with one hundred lashes on the back In Cherokee society persons of African descent were barred from holding office even if they were also racially and culturally Cherokee They were also barred from bearing arms and owning property The Cherokee prohibited the teaching of African Americans to read and write
By contrast the Seminole welcomed into their nation African Americans who had escaped slavery Black Seminoles Historically the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders Seminole practice in Florida had acknowledged slavery though not the chattel slavery model common elsewhere It was in fact more like feudal dependency and taxation The relationship between Seminole blacks and natives changed following their relocation in the s to territory controlled by the Creek who had a system of chattel slavery Pro slavery pressure from Creek and pro Creek Seminole and slave raiding led to many Black Seminoles escaping to Mexico
The Haida and Tlingit Indians who lived along the southeastern Alaskan coast were traditionally known as fierce warriors and slave traders raiding as far as California Slavery was hereditary after slaves were taken as prisoners of war Among some Pacific Northwest tribes about a quarter of the population were slaves Other slave owning tribes of North America were for example Comanche of Texas Creek of Georgia the fishing societies such as the Yurok that lived along the coast from what is now Alaska to California the Pawnee and Klamath
Some tribes held people as captive slaves late in the th century For instance Ute Woman was a Ute captured by the Arapaho and later sold to a Cheyenne She was kept by the Cheyenne to be used as a prostitute to serve American soldiers at Cantonment in the Indian Territory She lived in slavery until about She died of a hemorrhage resulting from excessive sexual intercourse
Slave owners included a comparatively small number of people of at least partial African ancestry in each of the original thirteen colonies and later states and territories that allowed slavery in some early cases black Americans also had white indentured servants An African former indentured servant who settled in Virginia in Anthony Johnson became one of the earliest documented slave owners in the mainland American colonies when he won a civil suit for ownership of John Casor In there were black including mixed race slaveholders in the South who owned a total of slaves which was a small percentage of a total of over two million slaves then held in the South of the black slaveholders were located in Louisiana South Carolina Virginia and Maryland
There were economic and ethnic differences between free blacks of the Upper South and the Deep South with the latter fewer in number but wealthier and typically of mixed race Half of the black slaveholders lived in cities rather than the countryside with most living in New Orleans and Charleston In particular New Orleans had a large relatively wealthy free black population gens de couleur composed of people of mixed race who had become a third social class between whites and enslaved blacks under French and Spanish colonial rule Relatively few non white slaveholders were substantial planters of those who were most were of mixed race often endowed by white fathers with some property and social capital For example Andrew Durnford of New Orleans was listed as owning slaves According to Rachel Kranz Durnford was known as a stern master who worked his slaves hard and punished them often in his efforts to make his Louisiana sugar plantation a success In the years leading up to the Civil War Antoine Dubuclet who owned over a hundred slaves was considered the wealthiest black slaveholder in Louisiana
The historians John Hope Franklin and Loren Schweninger wrote
The historian Ira Berlin wrote
African American history and culture scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr wrote
Free blacks were perceived as a continual symbolic threat to slaveholders challenging the idea that 'black' and 'slave' were synonymous Free blacks were sometimes seen as potential allies of fugitive slaves and slaveholders bore witness to their fear and loathing of free blacks in no uncertain terms For free blacks who had only a precarious hold on freedom slave ownership was not simply an economic convenience but indispensable evidence of the free blacks' determination to break with their slave past and their silent acceptance if not approval of slavery
The historian James Oakes in stated that
In his statewide study of black slaveholders in South Carolina Larry Koger challenged this benevolent view He found that the majority of mixed race or black slaveholders appeared to hold at least some of their slaves for commercial reasons For instance he noted that in more than of black slaveholders were of mixed race but nearly of their slaves were classified as black Koger also noted that many South Carolina free blacks operated small businesses as skilled artisans and many owned slaves working in those businesses Koger emphasizes that it was all too common for freed slaves to become slaveholders themselves
Some free black slaveholders in New Orleans offered to fight for Louisiana in the Civil War Over free black people volunteered and formed the st Louisiana Native Guard CSA which was disbanded without ever seeing combat
For various reasons the census did not always include all of the slaves especially in the West California was admitted as a free state and reported no slaves However there were many slaves that were brought to work in the mines during the California Gold Rush Some Californian communities openly tolerated slavery such as San Bernardino which was mostly made up of transplants from the neighboring slave territory of Utah New Mexico Territory never reported any slaves on the census yet sued the government for compensation for slaves that were freed when Congress outlawed slavery in the territory Utah was actively trying to hide its slave population from Congress and did not report slaves in several communities Additionally the census did not traditionally include Native Americans and hence did not include Native American slaves or Native African slaves owned by Native Americans There were hundreds of Native American slaves in California Utah and New Mexico that were never recorded in the census
As of the Census one may compute the following statistics on slaveholding
Enumerating slave schedules by county named persons held unnamed slaves for an average of about ten slaves per holder As some large holders held slaves in multiple counties and are thus multiply counted this slightly overestimates the number of slaveholders
Excluding slaves the U S population was therefore approximately of free persons roughly one in was a named slaveholder named slaveholders among free persons By counting only named slaveholders this approach does not acknowledge people who benefited from slavery by being in a slaveowning household e g the wife and children of an owner in there was an average of people per household so on average around of free persons lived in a slave owning household In the South of families owned at least one slave According to historian Joseph Glatthaar the number of soldiers of the Confederacy's Army of Northern Virginia who either owned slaves or came from slave owning households is almost one of every two recruits In addition he notes that Untold numbers of enlistees rented land from sold crops to or worked for slaveholders In the final tabulation the vast majority of the volunteers of had a direct connection to slavery
It is estimated by the transcriber Tom Blake that holders of or more slaves constituting less than of all U S slaveholders fewer than persons one in free persons or of the population held an estimated of all slaves to slaves Nineteen holders of or more slaves have been identified The largest slaveholder was Joshua John Ward of Georgetown South Carolina who in held slaves and whose heirs in held or slaves he was dubbed the king of the rice planters and one of his plantations is now part of Brookgreen Gardens
The percentage of families that owned slaves in in various groupings of states was as follows The historian Peter Kolchin writing in noted that until the latter decades of the th century historians of slavery had primarily concerned themselves with the culture practices and economics of the slaveholders not with the slaves This was in part due to the circumstance that most slaveholders were literate and left behind written records whereas slaves were largely illiterate and not in a position to leave written records Scholars differed as to whether slavery should be considered a benign or a harshly exploitive institution
Much of the history written prior to the s had a distinctive racist slant to it By the s and s historians were using archaeological records black folklore and statistical data to develop a much more detailed and nuanced picture of slave life Individuals were shown to have been resilient and somewhat autonomous in many of their activities within the limits of their situation and despite its precariousness Historians who wrote in this era include John Blassingame Slave Community Eugene Genovese Roll Jordan Roll Leslie Howard Owens This Species of Property and Herbert Gutman The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom
