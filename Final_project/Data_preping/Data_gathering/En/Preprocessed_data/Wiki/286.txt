the chinese civil war was fought between the kuomintang kmt led government of the republic of china roc and forces of the chinese communist party ccp lasting intermittently after
the war is generally divided into two phases with an interlude from august to the kmt ccp alliance collapsed during the northern expedition and the nationalists controlled most of china
from to hostilities were mostly put on hold as the second united front fought the japanese invasion of china with eventual help from the allies of world war ii but even then co operation between the kmt and ccp was minimal and armed clashes between them was common
exacerbating the divisions within china further was that a puppet government sponsored by japan and nominally led by wang jingwei was set up to nominally govern the parts of china under japanese occupation
the civil war resumed as soon as it became apparent that the japanese defeat was imminent and the ccp gained the upper hand in the second phase of the war from to generally referred to as the chinese communist revolution
the communists gained control of mainland china and established the people s republic of china prc in forcing the leadership of the republic of china to retreat to the island of taiwan
starting in the s a lasting political and military standoff between the two sides of the taiwan strait has ensued with the roc in taiwan and the prc in mainland china both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of all china
after the second taiwan strait crisis both tacitly ceased fire in however no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed
following the collapse of the qing dynasty and the revolution sun yat sen assumed the presidency of the newly formed republic of china and was shortly thereafter succeeded by yuan shikai
yuan was frustrated in a short lived attempt to restore monarchy in china and china fell into power struggle after his death in
the kuomintang kmt led by sun yat sen created a new government in guangzhou to rival the warlords who ruled over large swathes of china and prevented the formation of a solid central government
after sun s efforts to obtain aid from western countries were ignored he turned to the soviet union
in sun and soviet representative adolph joffe in shanghai pledged soviet assistance to china s unification in the sun joffe manifesto a declaration of cooperation among the comintern kmt and ccp
comintern agent mikhail borodin arrived in to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of both the ccp and the kmt along the lines of the communist party of the soviet union
the ccp which was initially a study group and the kmt jointly formed the first united front
in sun sent chiang kai shek one of his lieutenants for several months of military and political study in moscow
chiang then became the head of the whampoa military academy that trained the next generation of military leaders
the soviets provided the academy with teaching material organization and equipment including munitions
they also provided education in many of the techniques for mass mobilization
with this aid sun raised a dedicated army of the party with which he hoped to defeat the warlords militarily
ccp members were also present in the academy and many of them became instructors including zhou enlai who was made a political instructor
communist members were allowed to join the kmt on an individual basis
the ccp itself was still small at the time having a membership of in and only by
as of the kmt had members
however after sun died in the kmt split into left and right wing movements
kmt members worried that the soviets were trying to destroy the kmt from inside using the ccp
the ccp then began movements in opposition of the northern expedition passing a resolution against it at a party meeting
then in march the kmt held its second party meeting where the soviets helped pass resolutions against the expedition and curbing chiang s power
soon the kmt would be clearly divided
throughout this time the soviet union had a large impact on the chinese communist party
they sent money and spies to support the chinese communist party
without their support the communist party likely would have failed
this is evidenced by documents showing of other communist parties in china at the time one with as many as members but which all failed without support from the soviet union
in early the kmt ccp rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks
the ccp and the left wing of the kmt decided to move the seat of the kmt government from guangzhou to wuhan where communist influence was strong
however chiang and li zongren whose armies defeated the warlord sun chuanfang moved eastward toward jiangxi
the leftists rejected chiang s demand to eliminate communist influence within kmt and chiang denounced them for betraying sun yat sen s three principles of the people by taking orders from the soviet union
according to mao zedong chiang s tolerance of the ccp in the kmt camp decreased as his power increased
on april chiang and several other kmt leaders held a meeting during which they proposed that communist activities were socially and economically disruptive and had to be undone for the nationalist revolution to proceed
on april in shanghai many communist members in the kmt were purged through hundreds of arrests and executions on the orders of general bai chongxi
the ccp referred to this as the april incident the white terror or shanghai massacre
this incident widened the rift between chiang and wang jingwei the leader of the left wing faction of the kmt who controlled the city of wuhan
eventually the left wing of the kmt also expelled ccp members from the wuhan government which in turn was toppled by chiang kai shek
the kmt resumed its campaign against warlords and captured beijing in june
soon most of eastern china was under the control of the nanjing central government which received prompt international recognition as the sole legitimate government of china
the kmt government announced in conformity with sun yat sen the formula for the three stages of revolution military unification political tutelage and constitutional democracy
on august the communist party launched an uprising in nanchang against the nationalist government in wuhan
this conflict led to the creation of the red army
on august the main forces of the red army left nanchang and headed southwards for an assault on guangdong
nationalist forces quickly reoccupied nanchang while the remaining members of the ccp in nanchang went into hiding
a ccp meeting on august confirmed the objective of the party was to seize the political power by force but the ccp was quickly suppressed the next day on august by the nationalist government in wuhan led by wang jingwei
on august chiang kai shek announced his temporary retirement as the wuhan faction and nanjing faction of the kuomintang were allied once again with common goal of suppressing the communist party after the earlier split
attempts were later made by the ccp to take the cities of changsha shantou and guangzhou
the red army consisting of mutinous former national revolutionary army nra soldiers as well as armed peasants established control over several areas in southern china
kmt forces continued to attempt to suppress the rebellions
then in september wang jingwei was forced out of wuhan
september also saw an unsuccessful armed rural insurrection known as the autumn harvest uprising led by mao zedong
borodin then returned to the ussr in october via mongolia
in november chiang kai shek went to shanghai and invited wang to join him
on december the ccp started the guangzhou uprising establishing a soviet there the next day but lost the city by december to a counter attack under the orders of general zhang fakui
on december wang jingwei fled to france
there were now three capitals in china the internationally recognized republic capital in beijing the ccp and left wing kmt at wuhan and the right wing kmt regime at nanjing which would remain the kmt capital for the next decade
this marked the beginning of a ten year armed struggle known in mainland china as the ten year civil war which ended with the xi an incident when chiang kai shek was forced to form the second united front against invading forces from the empire of japan
in the central plains war broke out as an internal conflict of the kmt
it was launched by feng yuxiang yan xishan and wang jingwei
the attention was turned to root out remaining pockets of communist activity in a series of five encirclement campaigns
the first and second campaigns failed and the third was aborted due to the mukden incident
the fourth campaign achieved some early successes but chiang s armies were badly mauled when they tried to penetrate into the heart of mao s soviet chinese republic
during these campaigns kmt columns struck swiftly into communist areas but were easily engulfed by the vast countryside and were not able to consolidate their foothold
finally in late chiang launched a fifth campaign that involved the systematic encirclement of the jiangxi soviet region with fortified blockhouses
unlike previous campaigns in which they penetrated deeply in a single strike this time the kmt troops patiently built blockhouses each separated by about eight kilometres five miles to surround the communist areas and cut off their supplies and food sources
in october the ccp took advantage of gaps in the ring of blockhouses manned by the forces of a warlord ally of chiang kai shek s rather than regular kmt troops and broke out of the encirclement
the warlord armies were reluctant to challenge communist forces for fear of losing their own men and did not pursue the ccp with much fervor
in addition the main kmt forces were preoccupied with annihilating zhang guotao s army which was much larger than mao s
the massive military retreat of communist forces lasted a year and covered what mao estimated as km li it became known as the long march
this military retreat was undertaken by the chinese communist party led by mao zedong to evade the pursuit or attack of the kuomintang army
it consisted of a series of marches during which numerous communist armies in the south escaped to the north and west
over the course of the march from jiangxi the first front army led by an inexperienced military commission was on the brink of annihilation by chiang kai shek s troops as their stronghold was in jiangxi
the communists under the command of mao zedong and zhou enlai escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north which reportedly traversed over kilometers over days the route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western china by traveling west and then northwards towards shaanxi
in november shortly after settling in northern shaanxi mao officially took over zhou enlai s leading position in the red army
following a major reshuffling of official roles mao became the chairman of the military commission with zhou and deng xiaoping as vice chairmen this marked mao s position as the pre eminent leader of the party with zhou in second position to him
the march ended when the ccp reached the interior of shaanxi
zhang guotao s army which took a different route through northwest china was largely destroyed by the forces of chiang kai shek and his chinese muslim allies the ma clique
along the way the communist army confiscated property and weapons from local warlords and landlords while recruiting peasants and the poor solidifying its appeal to the masses
of the people who began the long march from the soviet chinese republic only around made it to shaanxi
the remnants of zhang s forces eventually joined mao in shaanxi but with his army destroyed zhang even as a founding member of the ccp was never able to challenge mao s authority
essentially the great retreat made mao the undisputed leader of the chinese communist party
the kuomintang used khampa troops who were former bandits to battle the communist red army as it advanced and to undermine local warlords who often refused to fight communist forces to conserve their own strength
the kmt enlisted khampa bandits into its consolatory commission military in sichuan where they were part of the effort of the central government to penetrate and destabilize local han warlords such as liu wenhui
the government was seeking to exert full control over frontier areas against the warlords
liu had refused to battle the communists in order to conserve his army
the consolatory commission forces were used to battle the red army but they were defeated when their religious leader was captured by the communists
in zhou enlai and zhang xueliang grew closer with zhou even suggesting that he join the ccp
however this was turned down by the comintern in the ussr
later on zhou persuaded zhang and yang hucheng another warlord to instigate the xi an incident
chiang was placed under house arrest and forced to stop his attacks on the red army instead focusing on the japanese threat
during japan s invasion and occupation of manchuria chiang kai shek saw the ccp as the greater threat
chiang refused to ally with the ccp preferring to unite china by eliminating the warlord and ccp forces first
he believed his forces too weak to face the japanese imperial army only after unification could the kmt mobilize against japan
he ignored the chinese people s discontent and anger at the kmt policy of compromise with the japanese instead ordering kmt generals zhang xueliang and yang hucheng to suppress the ccp
however their provincial forces suffered significant casualties in battles with the red army
on december the disgruntled zhang and yang conspired to kidnap chiang and force him into a truce with the ccp
the incident became known as the xi an incident
both parties suspended fighting to form a second united front to focus their energies and fight the japanese
in japan launched its full scale invasion of china and its well equipped troops overran kmt defenders in northern and coastal china
the alliance of ccp and kmt was in name only
unlike the kmt forces ccp troops shunned conventional warfare and instead waged guerrilla warfare against the japanese
the level of actual cooperation and coordination between the ccp and kmt during world war ii was minimal
in the midst of the second united front the ccp and the kmt were still vying for territorial advantage in free china i e areas not occupied by the japanese or ruled by japanese puppet governments such as manchukuo and the reorganized national government of china
the situation came to a head in late and early when clashes between communist and kmt forces intensified
chiang demanded in december that the ccp s new fourth army evacuate anhui and jiangsu provinces due to its provocation and harassment of kmt forces in this area
under intense pressure the new fourth army commanders complied
the following year they were ambushed by kmt forces during their evacuation which led to several thousand deaths
it also ended the second united front formed earlier to fight the japanese
as clashes between the ccp and kmt intensified countries such as the united states and the soviet union attempted to prevent a disastrous civil war
after the new fourth army incident us president franklin d
roosevelt sent special envoy lauchlin currie to talk with chiang kai shek and kmt party leaders to express their concern regarding the hostility between the two parties with currie stating that the only ones to benefit from a civil war would be the japanese
the soviet union allied more closely with the ccp sent an imperative telegram to mao in warning that civil war would also make the situation easier for the japanese military
due to the international community s efforts there was a temporary and superficial peace
chiang criticized the ccp in with the propaganda piece china s destiny which questioned the ccp s power after the war while the ccp strongly opposed chiang s leadership and referred to his regime as fascist in an attempt to generate a negative public image
both leaders knew that a deadly battle had begun between themselves
in general developments in the second sino japanese war were to the advantage of the ccp as its guerrilla war tactics had won them popular support within the japanese occupied areas
however the kmt had to defend the country against the main japanese campaigns since it was the legal chinese government a factor which proved costly to chiang kai shek and his troops
japan launched its last major offensive against the kmt operation ichi go in which resulted in the severe weakening of chiang s forces
the ccp also suffered fewer losses through its guerrilla tactics
by the end of the war the red army had grown to more than million members with a separate militia of over million
about one hundred million people lived in ccp controlled zones
under the terms of the japanese unconditional surrender dictated by the allies japanese troops were to surrender to kmt troops but not to the ccp which was present in some of the occupied areas
in manchuria however where the kmt had no forces the japanese surrendered to the soviet union
chiang kai shek reminded japanese troops to remain at their posts to receive the kmt but communist forces soon began taking surrenders from the japanese and fighting those who resisted
general wedemeyer of the united states army became alarmed at these developments and wanted seven american divisions to be sent to china but general marshall replied that it should not be given priority over japan and korea
the first post war peace negotiation attended by both chiang kai shek and mao zedong was in chongqing from august to october
chiang entered the meeting at an advantage because he had recently signed a friendly treaty with the soviet union while the communists were still forcing the japanese to surrender in some places
mao was accompanied by american ambassador patrick j
hurley who was devoted to chiang but also wanted to ensure mao s safety in light of the past history between the two chinese leaders
it concluded with the signing of the double tenth agreement
both sides stressed the importance of a peaceful reconstruction but the conference did not produce any concrete results
battles between the two sides continued even as peace negotiations were in progress until the agreement was reached in january
however large campaigns and full scale confrontations between the ccp and chiang s troops were temporarily avoided
in the last month of world war ii in east asia soviet forces launched the huge manchurian strategic offensive operation against the japanese kwantung army in manchuria and along the chinese mongolian border
this operation destroyed the kwantung army in just three weeks and left the ussr occupying all of manchuria by the end of the war in a total power vacuum of local chinese forces
consequently the japanese troops stationed in the region surrendered
later in the year chiang kai shek realized that he lacked the resources to prevent a ccp takeover of manchuria following the scheduled soviet departure
he therefore made a deal with the soviets to delay their withdrawal until he had moved enough of his best trained men and modern material into the region
however the soviets refused permission for the nationalist troops to traverse its territory and spent the extra time systematically dismantling the extensive manchurian industrial base worth up to billion and shipping it back to their war ravaged country
kmt troops were then airlifted by the us to occupy key cities in north china while the countryside was already dominated by the ccp
on november the kmt began a campaign to prevent the ccp from strengthening its already strong base
at the same time however the return of the kmt also brought widespread graft and corruption with an oss officer remarking that the only winners were the communists
in the winter of joseph stalin commanded marshal rodion malinovsky to give mao zedong most imperial japanese army weapons that were captured
chiang kai shek s forces pushed as far as chinchow jinzhou by november meeting with little resistance
this was followed by a communist offensive on the shandong peninsula that was largely successful as all of the peninsula except what was controlled by the us fell to the communists
the truce fell apart in june when full scale war between ccp and kmt forces broke out on june
china then entered a state of civil war that lasted more than three years
by the end of the second sino japanese war the power of the communist party grew considerably
their main force grew to million troops backed with additional militia of million totalling million troops
their liberated zone in contained base areas including one quarter of the country s territory and one third of its population this included many important towns and cities
moreover the soviet union turned over all of its captured japanese weapons and a substantial amount of their own supplies to the communists who received northeastern china from the soviets as well
in march despite repeated requests from chiang the soviet red army under the command of marshal rodion malinovsky continued to delay pulling out of manchuria while malinovsky secretly told the ccp forces to move in behind them which led to full scale war for the control of the northeast
these favorable conditions also facilitated many changes inside the communist leadership the more radical hard line faction who wanted a complete military take over of china finally gained the upper hand and defeated the careful opportunists
prior to giving control to communist leaders on march soviet diplomats requested a joint venture of industrial development with the nationalist party in manchuria
although general marshall stated that he knew of no evidence that the ccp was being supplied by the soviet union the ccp was able to utilize a large number of weapons abandoned by the japanese including some tanks
when large numbers of well trained kmt troops began to defect to the communist forces the ccp was finally able to achieve material superiority
the ccp s ultimate trump card was its land reform policy
this drew the massive number of landless and starving peasants in the countryside into the communist cause
this strategy enabled the ccp to access an almost unlimited supply of manpower for both combat and logistical purposes despite suffering heavy casualties throughout many of the war s campaigns manpower continued to grow
for example during the huaihai campaign alone the ccp was able to mobilize peasants to fight against the kmt forces
after the war with the japanese ended chiang kai shek quickly moved kmt troops to newly liberated areas to prevent communist forces from receiving the japanese surrender
the us airlifted many kmt troops from central china to the northeast manchuria
president harry s
truman was very clear about what he described as using the japanese to hold off the communists in his memoirs he writes
using the pretext of receiving the japanese surrender business interests within the kmt government occupied most of the banks factories and commercial properties which had previously been seized by the imperial japanese army
they also conscripted troops at an accelerated pace from the civilian population and hoarded supplies preparing for a resumption of war with the communists
these hasty and harsh preparations caused great hardship for the residents of cities such as shanghai where the unemployment rate rose dramatically to
the us strongly supported the kuomintang forces
about us soldiers were sent to guard strategic sites in hupeh and shandong in operation beleaguer
the us equipped and trained kmt troops and transported japanese and koreans back to help kmt forces to occupy liberated zones as well as to contain communist controlled areas
according to william blum american aid included substantial amounts of mostly surplus military supplies and loans were made to the kmt
within less than two years after the sino japanese war the kmt had received billion from the us most of which was military aid
as postwar negotiations between the nationalist government in nanjing and the communist party failed the civil war between these two parties resumed
this stage of war is referred to in mainland china and communist historiography as the war of liberation chinese pinyin ji f ng zh nzh ng
on july chiang kai shek launched a large scale assault on communist territory in north china with brigades a total of million troops
this marked the first stage of the final phase in the chinese civil war
knowing their disadvantages in manpower and equipment the ccp executed a passive defense strategy
it avoided the strong points of the kmt army and was prepared to abandon territory in order to preserve its forces
in most cases the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under communist influence long before the cities
the ccp also attempted to wear out the kmt forces as much as possible
this tactic seemed to be successful after a year the power balance became more favorable to the ccp
they wiped out million kmt troops while their strength grew to about two million men
in march the kmt achieved a symbolic victory by seizing the ccp capital of yan an
the communists counterattacked soon afterwards on june ccp troops crossed the yellow river and moved to the dabie mountains area restored and developed the central plain
at the same time communist forces also began to counterattack in northeastern china north china and east china
by late the ccp eventually captured the northern cities of shenyang and changchun and seized control of the northeast after suffering numerous setbacks while trying to take the cities with the decisive liaoshen campaign
the new st army regarded as the best kmt army was forced to surrender after the ccp conducted a brutal six month siege of changchun that resulted in more than civilian deaths from starvation
the capture of large kmt units provided the ccp with the tanks heavy artillery and other combined arms assets needed to execute offensive operations south of the great wall
by april the city of luoyang fell cutting the kmt army off from xi an
following a fierce battle the ccp captured jinan and shandong province on september
the huaihai campaign of late and early secured east central china for the ccp
the outcome of these encounters were decisive for the military outcome of the civil war
the pingjin campaign resulted in the communist conquest of northern china
it lasted days from november to january
the pla suffered heavy casualties while securing zhangjiakou tianjin along with its port and garrison at dagu and beiping
the ccp brought troops from the northeast to oppose some kmt troops
there were ccp casualties at zhangjiakou alone
they in turn killed wounded or captured some kmt during the campaign
after achieving decisive victory at liaoshen huaihai and pingjin campaigns the ccp wiped out regular and irregular kmt divisions including million veteran kmt troops which significantly reduced the strength of nationalist forces
stalin initially favored a coalition government in postwar china and tried to persuade mao to stop the ccp from crossing the yangtze and attacking the kmt positions south of the river
mao rejected stalin s position and on april and began the yangtze river crossing campaign
on april they captured the kmt s capital nanjing
the kmt government retreated to canton guangzhou until october chongqing until november and then chengdu before retreating to taiwan on december
by late the people s liberation army was pursuing remnants of kmt forces southwards in southern china and only tibet was left
a chinese muslim hui cavalry regiment the th tungan cavalry was sent by the chinese government to attack mongol and soviet positions along the border during the pei ta shan incident
the kuomintang made several last ditch attempts to use khampa troops against the communists in southwest china
the kuomintang formulated a plan in which three khampa divisions would be assisted by the panchen lama to oppose the communists
kuomintang intelligence reported that some tibetan tusi chiefs and the khampa su yonghe controlled troops in sichuan qinghai and tibet
they hoped to use them against the communist army
on october mao zedong proclaimed the founding of the people s republic of china with its capital at beiping which was returned to the former name beijing
chiang kai shek and approximately two million nationalist soldiers retreated from mainland china to the island of taiwan in december after the pla advanced into the sichuan province
isolated nationalist pockets of resistance remained in the area but the majority of the resistance collapsed after the fall of chengdu on december with some resistance continuing in the far south
a prc attempt to take the roc controlled island of quemoy was thwarted in the battle of kuningtou halting the pla advance towards taiwan
in december chiang proclaimed taipei the temporary capital of the republic of china and continued to assert his government as the sole legitimate authority in china
the communists other amphibious operations of were more successful they led to the communist conquest of hainan island in april capture of wanshan islands off the guangdong coast may august zhoushan island off zhejiang may
most observers expected chiang s government to eventually fall to the imminent invasion of taiwan by the people s liberation army and the us was initially reluctant in offering full support for chiang in their final stand
us president harry s
truman announced on january that the united states would not engage in any dispute involving the taiwan strait and that he would not intervene in the event of an attack by the prc
truman seeking to exploit the possibility of a titoist style sino soviet split announced in his united states policy toward formosa that the us would obey the cairo declaration s designation of taiwan as chinese territory and would not assist the nationalists
however the communist leadership was not aware of this change of policy instead becoming increasingly hostile to the us
the situation quickly changed after the sudden onset of the korean war in june
this led to changing political climate in the us and president truman ordered the united states seventh fleet to sail to the taiwan strait as part of the containment policy against potential communist advance
in june the roc declared a closure of all mainland china ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships
the closure was from a point north of the mouth of min river in fujian to the mouth of the liao river in liaoning
since mainland china s railroad network was underdeveloped north south trade depended heavily on sea lanes
roc naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland china fishermen
during the retreat of the the republic of china to taiwan kmt troops who couldn t retreat to taiwan were left behind and allied with local bandits to fight a guerrilla war against the communists
these kmt remnants were eliminated in the campaign to suppress counterrevolutionaries and the campaigns to suppress bandits
winning china proper in also after annexation of tibet the ccp controlled the entire mainland in late excluding kinmen and matsu islands
but a group of approximately kmt central soldiers retreated to burma and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south china during the kuomintang islamic insurgency in china and campaign at the china burma border
their leader li mi was paid a salary by the roc government and given the nominal title of governor of yunnan
initially the us supported these remnants and the central intelligence agency provided them with military aid
after the burmese government appealed to the united nations in the us began pressuring the roc to withdraw its loyalists
by the end of nearly soldiers had left burma and li declared his army disbanded
however thousands remained and the roc continued to supply and command them even secretly supplying reinforcements at times to maintain a base close to china
after the roc complained to the united nations against the soviet union for violating the sino soviet treaty of friendship and alliance to support the ccp the un general assembly resolution was adopted on february condemning the soviet union
in the end the communist military forces suffered million combat casualties in the phase of the war killed missing and wounded discounting irregulars
nationalist casualties in the same phase were recorded after the war by the prc regulars and irregulars
though viewed as a military liability by the us the roc viewed its remaining islands in fujian as vital for any future campaign to defeat the prc and retake mainland china
on september the first taiwan strait crisis began when the pla started shelling kinmen and threatened to take the dachen islands in zhejiang
on january the pla took nearby yijiangshan island with the entire roc garrison of troops killed or wounded defending the island
on january of the same year the united states congress passed the formosa resolution authorizing the president to defend the roc s offshore islands
the first taiwan straits crisis ended in march when the pla ceased its bombardment
the crisis was brought to a close during the bandung conference
the second taiwan strait crisis began on august with air and naval engagements between prc and roc forces leading to intense artillery bombardment of quemoy by the prc and amoy by the roc and ended on november of the same year
pla patrol boats blockaded the islands from roc supply ships
though the us rejected chiang kai shek s proposal to bomb mainland china artillery batteries it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti aircraft missiles to the roc
it also provided amphibious assault ships to land supplies as a sunken roc naval vessel was blocking the harbor
on september the us escorted a convoy of roc supply ships and the prc refrained from firing
the third taiwan strait crisis in escalated tensions between both sides when the prc tested a series of missiles not far from taiwan although arguably beijing ran the test to shift the presidential election vote in favor of the kmt already facing a challenge from the opposition democratic progressive party which did not agree with the one china policy shared by the ccp and kmt
the thirds phase of the war is unlikely due to the difficulty and the independence was never declared us expect the close moment will be the centenary of china s people s liberation army pla also years anniversary of this civil war
however no evidence that beijing was planning to invade taiwan by or given up on its vow to achieve peaceful unification but tensions and possibility of escalation between both sides still exist beijing accuses us of deliberately damaging peace chinese defence minister wei fenghe warns splitting taiwan from china would leave the chinese military with no choice but to respond even as he reaffirmed beijing s commitment to maintaining peace
on october the united nations general assembly admitted the prc and expelled the roc which had been a founding member of the united nations and was one of the five permanent members of the security council
representatives of chiang kai shek refused to recognise their accreditations as representatives of china and left the assembly
recognition for the people s republic of china soon followed from most other member nations including the united states
by prc and roc began to de escalate their hostilities through diplomatic relations with each other and cross straits trade and investment has been growing ever since
the state of war was officially declared over by the roc in
despite the end of the hostilities the two sides have never signed any agreement or treaty to officially end the war
according to mao zedong there were three ways of staving off imperialist intervention in the short term during the continuation of the chinese revolution
the first was through a rapid completion of the military takeover of the country and through showing determination and strength against foreign attempts at challenging the new regime along its borders the second was by formalising a comprehensive military alliance with the soviet union which would dedicate soviet power to directly defending china against its enemies this aspect became extensively significant given the backdrop of the start of the cold war
and finally the regime had to root out its domestic opponents the heads of secret societies religious sects independent unions or tribal and ethnic organisations by destroying the basis of domestic reaction mao believed a safer world for the chinese revolution to spread in would come into existence
under the new roc president lee teng hui the temporary provisions effective during the period of communist rebellion was renounced in may thus ending the chances of the kuomintang s quest to retake the mainland
in july lee announced a special diplomatic relationship
china was furious again but the military drills were stopped by the earthquakes
it was the last tense moment of this civil war
with the election in of democratic progressive party candidate chen shui bian a party other than the kmt gained the presidency for the first time in taiwan
the new president did not share the chinese nationalist ideology of the kmt and ccp
this led to tension between the two sides although trade and other ties such as the pan blue visit continued to increase
with the election of pro mainland president ma ying jeou kmt in significant warming of relations resumed between taipei and beijing with high level exchanges between the semi official diplomatic organizations of both states such as the chen chiang summit series
although the taiwan strait remains a potential flash point regular direct air links were established in
the historian rana mitter concluded that the nationalist government in had been fundamentally destroyed by the war with japan
during the war the ccp avoided any radical class related policies of wealth or land redistribution so as to maximise national unity against the japanese
this was highly successful at raising the ccp s popularity which reached its highest ever level
in addition the peasants only joined the communists en masse after the japanese invaded rather than cooperate with the invaders
hence it is demonstrable that communist popularity did not come from their land reform proposals or rural poverty
the japanese puppet government of china produced extensive propaganda claiming that their main purpose was anti communism which backfired and helped to bolster the legitimacy of communists further among the peasant victims of japanese reprisals
when the kmt right wing objected to ccp expansion of influence as part of guerilla campaigns they were attacked on patriotic grounds
the communists were able to gain popular legitimacy for their actions as long as they were carrying out resistance against japan with greater aggressiveness than the kmt government and this advantage was utilized by the communists as seen in the new fourth army incident
historian odd arne westad says the communists won the civil war because they made fewer military mistakes than chiang kai shek and also because in his search for a powerful centralized government chiang antagonized too many interest groups in china
furthermore his party was weakened in the war against the japanese
meanwhile the communists targeted different groups such as peasants and brought them to their side
chiang wrote in his diary in june after the fall of kaifeng our conditions worsened and became more serious
i now realized that the main reason our nation has collapsed time after time throughout our history was not because of superior power used by our external enemies but because of disintegration and rot from within
although officially the soviet union and north korea were not supporting the communist forces they gave logistic support transported and helped to deploy the communist soldiers to fight the kuomintang also transported sick and wounded soldiers gave the weapons of manchukuo to the chinese communist party north korea sent an army to fight the kuomintang etc
chen yun said they did their best to help us we were backed by the soviet union and north korea
strong american support for the nationalists was hedged with the failure of the marshall mission and then stopped completely mainly because of kmt corruption such as the notorious yangtze development corporation controlled by h h
kung and t
soong s family and kmt s military setback in northeast china
the main advantage of the chinese communist party was the extraordinary cohesion within the top level of its leadership
these skills were not only secured from defections that came about during difficult times but also coupled with communications and top level debates over tactics the charismatic style of leadership of mao zedong created a unity of purpose and a unity of command which the kmt lacked
apart from that the ccp had mastered the manipulation of local politics to their benefit this was also derived from their propaganda skills that had also been decentralised successfully
by portraying their opponents as enemies of all groups of chinese and itself as defenders of the nation and people given the backdrop of the war with japan
