later robie is staking out an estate at night when he is attacked by an unknown assailant

but when the police reach the body in the water it turns out to be foussard one of the staff at bertani s restaurant
the police chief publicly announces that foussard was the jewel thief but as robie points out privately in the abashed hughson s presence this would have been impossible because foussard had a wooden leg and could not climb on rooftops

outside the graveyard frances apologizes to robie and confesses her love
robie asks frances to arrange his attendance at a fancy masquerade ball where he believes the cat will strike again

upon the masked moor s return the police wait as he and frances dance together all night
when the masked moor and frances go to her room the mask is removed it was hughson who switched places with robie to conceal robie s exit
robie lurks on the rooftop and his patience is finally rewarded when he spots a figure in black
however just as his pursuit begins the police throw a spotlight on him and demand he halt
he flees as they shoot at him but he nonetheless manages to corner his foe with jewels in hand
unmasked his nemesis turns out to be danielle
she loses her footing on the roof but robie grabs her hand before she can fall
while she hangs in his grasp he forces her to confess to the police and admit that bertani was the ringleader of this gang

bosley crowther of the new york times wrote in a positive review that the film comes off completely as a hit in the old hitchcock style
grant and miss kelly do grandly especially in one sly seduction scene variety wrote that while the film was not the suspense piece one usually associated with the alfred hitchcock name it was strong on sight and performance values though it had some plot weaknesses and is not as smooth in the unfolding as one might expect from an upper a presentation
harrison s reports wrote alfred hitchcock has not endowed the action with as much suspense as one might expect in a picture produced and directed by him nevertheless its story of a one time jewel robber who sets out to establish his innocence by catching a thief who was using his technique is tight and swiftly paced and constantly offers dramatic and comical developments richard l
coe of the washington post called it one of those de luxe pictures in which everyone lives in glorious workless luxury on the french rivera looks wonderful speaks amusingly and is unconcerned with transit strikes or hurricanes
i loved every minute of it
philip k
scheuer of the los angeles times was also positive calling grant and kelly ideal in the romantic leads and the dialogue daring but delightful adding above all there is the spell of the french riviera a lazy laissez faire thing that apparently captivated the director as much as it will audiences in the soft beguiling hues of its technicolor and vistavision
john mccarten of the new yorker dismissed the film as an alfred hitchcock picture that makes you wonder what has happened to the man
as the heiress grace kelly is very pretty
she does not presumably try to act the monthly film bulletin wrote even a comedy thriller needs considerably more in the way of plain excitement and tension than to catch a thief provides and hitchcock s celebrated habit of playing tricks with the audience
seem a poor substitute for the real thing
the guardian called the film a thorough disappointment writing that hitchcock had failed so completely that one can only wonder if in this tale of high class burglary on the c te d azur he has not altogether abandoned his devotion to tension certainly the whodunnit element in this film is remarkably slack the unmasking of the master criminal which is the climax of the story comes as mildly as bread and milk
fran ois truffaut wrote to catch a thief completely satisfies all hitchcock s fans the snobbiest and the most ordinary and still manages to be one of the most cynical films hitchcock has ever made
on rotten tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews from critics with an average rating of with the critical consensus reading it may occasionally be guilty of coasting on pure charm but to catch a thief has it in spades as well as a pair of perfectly matched stars in cary grant and grace kelly
