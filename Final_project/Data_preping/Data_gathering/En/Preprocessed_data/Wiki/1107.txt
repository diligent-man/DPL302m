The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO has designated World Heritage Sites in Africa
These sites are located in countries also called state parties
South Africa has the lead with ten sites followed by Ethiopia and Morocco being home to nine sites then Tunisia with eight sites and Algeria Egypt Kenya Senegal and Tanzania at seven
Nine countries have only a single site each
Four sites are shared between two countries Maloti-Drakensberg Park Lesotho and South Africa the Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve Cte d'Ivoire and Guinea the Stone Circles of Senegambia the Gambia and Senegal and Mosi-oa-Tunya Victoria Falls Zambia and Zimbabwe
Two sites are shared among three countries Sangha Trinational Central African Republic Cameroon and Congo and W-Arly-Penjari Complex Benin Burkina Faso and Niger
The first sites from the continent were inscribed in when the Island of Gore of Senegal and the Rock-Hewn Churches and Simien National Park of Ethiopia were chosen during the list's conception
As of September Somalia has no official World Heritage Sites since the Somali government is not party to the World Heritage Convention
However there are around a dozen archaeological sites in the country that are believed to be potential future candidates for World Heritage status
Each year UNESCO's World Heritage Committee may inscribe new sites on the list or delist sites that no longer meet the criteria
Selection is based on ten criteria six for cultural heritage ivi and four for natural heritage viix
Some sites designated mixed sites represent both cultural and natural heritage
In Africa there are cultural natural and mixed sites
Several efforts have been devoted to increasing the number of sites and preserving the heritage of existing sites on the continent for example on May the African World Heritage Fund was launched by UNESCO to target the region of Sub-Saharan Africa
It planned to protect the sites by hiring personnel for state parties to maintain national inventories of existing sites as well as to prepare nomination dossiers for inscription onto the World Heritage List
Grants were also destined to help the conservation and management of heritage properties in general and to rehabilitate properties in danger
The drive was initially funded by South Africa with US million and as of March has amassed million from various countries with an additional million in pending pledges
UNESCO has also attempted to increase awareness of African human origin sites in Ethiopia with a goal of conserving and protecting the areas from further deterioration
The World Heritage Committee may also specify that a site is endangered citing conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List
Along with other World Heritage Sites sites in danger are subject to re-evaluation by the committee every year at their ordinary sessions
Africa has sites on the danger list accounting for of all African sites and of the endangered sites worldwide
Libya has sites on the danger list the second-highest of any country in the world
Sites in Africa have been marked as such for a variety of reasons such as deforestation and hunting civil war threats to and hostage taking of reserve staff oil and gas projects and mining declines in biodiversity and structural damage to buildings
Ten sites were formerly declared as being in danger but have since lost the status examples include the Ngorongoro Conservation Area the Rwenzori Mountains National Park and Tipasa
Garamba National Park and Timbuktu have also lost their statuses in and respectively but later regained it in and
Despite its large number of endangered sites and the circumstances surrounding them African World Heritage Sites have never been stripped of their title something that has only occurred three times
The list below ignores UNESCO's geopolitical definition of Africa and includes what it describes as sites in the Arab States
Egypt is included as part of North Africa
The list also comprises a number of sites for which the state party is outside the continent but the site itself is located in Africa four such sites are located on the Canary Islands belonging to Spain one on Madeira belonging to Portugal one on Runion belonging to France and one on the Tristan da Cunha archipelago belonging to the United Kingdom
Site named after the World Heritage Committee's official designation
Location sorted by country followed by the region at the regional or provincial level

Criteria as defined by the World Heritage Committee
Area in hectares and acres excluding any buffer zones
A value of â€” implies that no data has been published by UNESCO
Year during which the site was inscribed to the World Heritage List
Description brief information about the site including reasons for qualifying as an endangered site if applicable
The countries are divided according to their regions blue for Northern Africa orange for Eastern Africa purple for Central Africa green for Western Africa and red for Southern Africa
