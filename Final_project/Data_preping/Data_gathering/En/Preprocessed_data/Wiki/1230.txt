This family of curves was investigated by Nathaniel Bowditch  in 1815, and later in more detail in 1857 by Jules Antoine Lissajous (for whom it has been named).
The appearance of the figure is highly sensitive to the ratio a/b
For a ratio of 1, the figure is an ellipse, with special cases including circles (A = B, δ = π/2 radians) and lines (δ = 0)
Another simple Lissajous figure is the parabola (b/a = 2, δ = π/4)
Other ratios produce more complicated curves, which are closed only if a/b is rational
The visual form of these curves is often suggestive of a three-dimensional knot, and indeed many kinds of knots, including those known as Lissajous knots, project to the plane as Lissajous figures.
Visually, the ratio a/b determines the number of "lobes" of the figure
For example, a ratio of 3/1 or 1/3 produces a figure with three major lobes (see image)
Similarly, a ratio of 5/4 produces a figure with five horizontal lobes and four vertical lobes
Rational ratios produce closed (connected) or "still" figures, while irrational ratios produce figures that appear to rotate
The ratio A/B determines the relative width-to-height ratio of the curve
For example, a ratio of 2/1 produces a figure that is twice as wide as it is high
Finally, the value of δ determines the apparent "rotation" angle of the figure, viewed as if it were actually a three-dimensional curve
For example, δ = 0 produces x and y components that are exactly in phase, so the resulting figure appears as an apparent three-dimensional figure viewed from straight on (0°)
In contrast, any non-zero δ produces a figure that appears to be rotated, either as a left–right or an up–down rotation (depending on the ratio a/b).

are Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind of degree N
This property is exploited to produce a set of points, called Padua points, at which a function may be sampled in order to compute either a bivariate interpolation or quadrature of the function over the domain [−1,1] × [−1,1].
The relation of some Lissajous curves to Chebyshev polynomials is clearer to understand if the Lissajous curve which generates each of them is expressed using cosine functions rather than sine functions.

Below are examples of Lissajous figures with an odd natural number a, an even natural number b, and |a − b| = 1.
Prior to modern electronic equipment, Lissajous curves could be generated mechanically by means of a harmonograph.
Lissajous curves can also be generated using an oscilloscope (as illustrated)
An octopus circuit can be used to demonstrate the waveform images on an oscilloscope
Two phase-shifted sinusoid inputs are applied to the oscilloscope in X-Y mode and the phase relationship between the signals is presented as a Lissajous figure.
In the professional audio world, this method is used for realtime analysis of the phase relationship between the left and right channels of a stereo audio signal
On larger, more sophisticated audio mixing consoles an oscilloscope may be built-in for this purpose.
On an oscilloscope, we suppose x is CH1 and y is CH2, A is the amplitude of CH1 and B is the amplitude of CH2, a is the frequency of CH1 and b is the frequency of CH2, so a/b is the ratio of frequencies of the two channels, and δ is the phase shift of CH1.
A purely mechanical application of a Lissajous curve with a = 1, b = 2 is in the driving mechanism of the Mars Light type of oscillating beam lamps popular with railroads in the mid-1900s
The beam in some versions traces out a lopsided figure-8 pattern on its side.
When the input to an LTI system is sinusoidal, the output is sinusoidal with the same frequency, but it may have a different amplitude and some phase shift
Using an oscilloscope that can plot one signal against another (as opposed to one signal against time) to plot the output of an LTI system against the input to the LTI system produces an ellipse that is a Lissajous figure for the special case of a = b
The aspect ratio of the resulting ellipse is a function of the phase shift between the input and output, with an aspect ratio of 1 (perfect circle) corresponding to a phase shift of ±90° and an aspect ratio of ∞ (a line) corresponding to a phase shift of 0° or 180°.
The figure below summarizes how the Lissajous figure changes over different phase shifts
The phase shifts are all negative so that delay semantics can be used with a causal LTI system (note that −270° is equivalent to +90°)
The arrows show the direction of rotation of the Lissajous figure.
A Lissajous curve is used in experimental tests to determine if a device may be properly categorized as a memristor
It is also used to compare two different electrical signals: a known reference signal and a signal to be tested.
Lissajous figures were sometimes displayed on oscilloscopes meant to simulate high-tech equipment in science-fiction TV shows and movies in the 1960s and 1970s.The title sequence by John Whitney for Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 feature film Vertigo is based on Lissajous figures.Lissajous figures are sometimes used in graphic design as logos
Examples include:
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (a = 1, b = 3, δ = π/2)
The Lincoln Laboratory at MIT (a = 3, b = 4, δ = π/2)
The University of Electro-Communications, Japan (a = 5, b = 6, δ = π/2).
