a lissajous curve l s u also known as lissajous figure or bowditch curve ba d t is the graph of a system of parametric equations
displaystyle x a sin at delta quad y b sin bt
which describe complex harmonic motion
this family of curves was investigated by nathaniel bowditch in and later in more detail in by jules antoine lissajous for whom it has been named
the appearance of the figure is highly sensitive to the ratio a b
for a ratio of the figure is an ellipse with special cases including circles a b radians and lines
another simple lissajous figure is the parabola b a
other ratios produce more complicated curves which are closed only if a b is rational
the visual form of these curves is often suggestive of a three dimensional knot and indeed many kinds of knots including those known as lissajous knots project to the plane as lissajous figures
visually the ratio a b determines the number of lobes of the figure
for example a ratio of or produces a figure with three major lobes see image
similarly a ratio of produces a figure with five horizontal lobes and four vertical lobes
rational ratios produce closed connected or still figures while irrational ratios produce figures that appear to rotate
the ratio a b determines the relative width to height ratio of the curve
for example a ratio of produces a figure that is twice as wide as it is high
finally the value of determines the apparent rotation angle of the figure viewed as if it were actually a three dimensional curve
for example produces x and y components that are exactly in phase so the resulting figure appears as an apparent three dimensional figure viewed from straight on
in contrast any non zero produces a figure that appears to be rotated either as a left right or an up down rotation depending on the ratio a b
lissajous figures where a b n n is a natural number and
displaystyle delta frac n n frac pi
are chebyshev polynomials of the first kind of degree n
this property is exploited to produce a set of points called padua points at which a function may be sampled in order to compute either a bivariate interpolation or quadrature of the function over the domain
the relation of some lissajous curves to chebyshev polynomials is clearer to understand if the lissajous curve which generates each of them is expressed using cosine functions rather than sine functions

below are examples of lissajous figures with an odd natural number a an even natural number b and a b
prior to modern electronic equipment lissajous curves could be generated mechanically by means of a harmonograph
lissajous curves can also be generated using an oscilloscope as illustrated
an octopus circuit can be used to demonstrate the waveform images on an oscilloscope
two phase shifted sinusoid inputs are applied to the oscilloscope in x y mode and the phase relationship between the signals is presented as a lissajous figure
in the professional audio world this method is used for realtime analysis of the phase relationship between the left and right channels of a stereo audio signal
on larger more sophisticated audio mixing consoles an oscilloscope may be built in for this purpose
on an oscilloscope we suppose x is ch and y is ch a is the amplitude of ch and b is the amplitude of ch a is the frequency of ch and b is the frequency of ch so a b is the ratio of frequencies of the two channels and is the phase shift of ch
a purely mechanical application of a lissajous curve with a b is in the driving mechanism of the mars light type of oscillating beam lamps popular with railroads in the mid s
the beam in some versions traces out a lopsided figure pattern on its side
when the input to an lti system is sinusoidal the output is sinusoidal with the same frequency but it may have a different amplitude and some phase shift
using an oscilloscope that can plot one signal against another as opposed to one signal against time to plot the output of an lti system against the input to the lti system produces an ellipse that is a lissajous figure for the special case of a b
the aspect ratio of the resulting ellipse is a function of the phase shift between the input and output with an aspect ratio of perfect circle corresponding to a phase shift of and an aspect ratio of a line corresponding to a phase shift of or
the figure below summarizes how the lissajous figure changes over different phase shifts
the phase shifts are all negative so that delay semantics can be used with a causal lti system note that is equivalent to
the arrows show the direction of rotation of the lissajous figure
a lissajous curve is used in experimental tests to determine if a device may be properly categorized as a memristor
it is also used to compare two different electrical signals a known reference signal and a signal to be tested
lissajous figures were sometimes displayed on oscilloscopes meant to simulate high tech equipment in science fiction tv shows and movies in the s and s the title sequence by john whitney for alfred hitchcock s feature film vertigo is based on lissajous figures lissajous figures are sometimes used in graphic design as logos
