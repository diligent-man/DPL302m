A Lissajous curve ˈlɪsəʒuː also known as Lissajous figure or Bowditch curve ˈbaʊdɪtʃ is the graph of a system of parametric equations
which describe complex harmonic motion This family of curves was investigated by Nathaniel Bowditch in and later in more detail in by Jules Antoine Lissajous for whom it has been named
The appearance of the figure is highly sensitive to the ratio ab For a ratio of the figure is an ellipse with special cases including circles A = B δ = π radians and lines δ = Another simple Lissajous figure is the parabola ba = δ = π Other ratios produce more complicated curves which are closed only if ab is rational The visual form of these curves is often suggestive of a three dimensional knot and indeed many kinds of knots including those known as Lissajous knots project to the plane as Lissajous figures
Visually the ratio ab determines the number of lobes of the figure For example a ratio of or produces a figure with three major lobes see image Similarly a ratio of produces a figure with five horizontal lobes and four vertical lobes Rational ratios produce closed connected or still figures while irrational ratios produce figures that appear to rotate The ratio AB determines the relative width to height ratio of the curve For example a ratio of produces a figure that is twice as wide as it is high Finally the value of δ determines the apparent rotation angle of the figure viewed as if it were actually a three dimensional curve For example δ = produces x and y components that are exactly in phase so the resulting figure appears as an apparent three dimensional figure viewed from straight on ° In contrast any non zero δ produces a figure that appears to be rotated either as a left right or an up down rotation depending on the ratio ab
Lissajous figures where a = b = N N is a natural number and
are Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind of degree N This property is exploited to produce a set of points called Padua points at which a function may be sampled in order to compute either a bivariate interpolation or quadrature of the function over the domain − × −
The relation of some Lissajous curves to Chebyshev polynomials is clearer to understand if the Lissajous curve which generates each of them is expressed using cosine functions rather than sine functions
The animation shows the curve adaptation with continuously increasing ab fraction from to in steps of δ =
Below are examples of Lissajous figures with an odd natural number a an even natural number b and a − b =
Prior to modern electronic equipment Lissajous curves could be generated mechanically by means of a harmonograph
Lissajous curves can also be generated using an oscilloscope as illustrated An octopus circuit can be used to demonstrate the waveform images on an oscilloscope Two phase shifted sinusoid inputs are applied to the oscilloscope in X Y mode and the phase relationship between the signals is presented as a Lissajous figure
In the professional audio world this method is used for realtime analysis of the phase relationship between the left and right channels of a stereo audio signal On larger more sophisticated audio mixing consoles an oscilloscope may be built in for this purpose
On an oscilloscope we suppose x is CH and y is CH A is the amplitude of CH and B is the amplitude of CH a is the frequency of CH and b is the frequency of CH so ab is the ratio of frequencies of the two channels and δ is the phase shift of CH
A purely mechanical application of a Lissajous curve with a = b = is in the driving mechanism of the Mars Light type of oscillating beam lamps popular with railroads in the mid s The beam in some versions traces out a lopsided figure pattern on its side
When the input to an LTI system is sinusoidal the output is sinusoidal with the same frequency but it may have a different amplitude and some phase shift Using an oscilloscope that can plot one signal against another as opposed to one signal against time to plot the output of an LTI system against the input to the LTI system produces an ellipse that is a Lissajous figure for the special case of a = b The aspect ratio of the resulting ellipse is a function of the phase shift between the input and output with an aspect ratio of perfect circle corresponding to a phase shift of ±° and an aspect ratio of ∞ a line corresponding to a phase shift of ° or °
The figure below summarizes how the Lissajous figure changes over different phase shifts The phase shifts are all negative so that delay semantics can be used with a causal LTI system note that −° is equivalent to +° The arrows show the direction of rotation of the Lissajous figure
A Lissajous curve is used in experimental tests to determine if a device may be properly categorized as a memristor It is also used to compare two different electrical signals a known reference signal and a signal to be tested
Lissajous figures were sometimes displayed on oscilloscopes meant to simulate high tech equipment in science fiction TV shows and movies in the s and sThe title sequence by John Whitney for Alfred Hitchcock's feature film Vertigo is based on Lissajous figuresLissajous figures are sometimes used in graphic design as logos Examples include

Disney's Movies Anywhere streaming video application uses a stylized version of the curve
