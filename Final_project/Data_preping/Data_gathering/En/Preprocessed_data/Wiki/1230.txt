similarly ratio produce figure five horizontal lobe four vertical lobes
rational ratio produce closed connected still figure irrational ratio produce figure appear rotate
finally value determines apparent rotation angle figure viewed actually three-dimensional curve
example produce x component exactly phase resulting figure appears apparent three-dimensional figure viewed straight on
