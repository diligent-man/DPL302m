a legislature is an assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city
they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial powers of government
laws enacted by legislatures are usually known as primary legislation
in addition legislatures may observe and steer governing actions with authority to amend the budget involved
the members of a legislature are called legislators
in a democracy legislators are most commonly popularly elected although indirect election and appointment by the executive are also used particularly for bicameral legislatures featuring an upper chamber
the name used to refer to a legislative body varies by country
common names include
assembly from to assemble
congress from to congregate
council from latin meeting
diet from old german people
estates or states from old french condition or status
parliament from french parler to speak by names
house of assembly
legislative assembly
legislative council
national assemblyby languages
cortes from spanish courts
duma from russian d ma thought
rada from ukrainian council
sejm from polish gathering
soviet from russian council
thing from old germanic assembly
veche from old slavic council though the specific roles for each legislature differ by location they all aim to serve the same purpose of appointing officials to represent their citizens to determine appropriate legislation for the country
among the earliest recognised legislatures was the athenian ecclesia
in the middle ages european monarchs would host assemblies of the nobility which would later develop into predecessors of modern legislatures
these were often named the estates
the oldest surviving legislature is the icelandic althing founded in ce
democratic legislatures have six major functions representation deliberation legislation authorizing expenditure making governments and oversight
there exist five ways that representation can be achieved in a legislature
formalistically how the rules of the legislature ensure representation of constituents
symbolically how the constituents perceive their representatives
descriptively how well the composition of the legislature matches the demographics of the wider society
substantively how well representatives actually respond to the needs of their constituents
collectively how well the representatives represent the interests of the society as a whole one of the major functions of a legislature is to discuss and debate issues of major importance to society
this activity can take place in two forms
in debating legislatures like parliament of the united kingdom the floor of the legislature frequently sees lively debate
in contrast in committee based legislatures like the united states congress deliberation takes place in closed committees
while legislatures have nominally the sole power to create laws the substantive extent of this power depends on details of the political system
in westminster style legislatures the executive composed of the cabinet can essentially pass any laws it wants as it usually has a majority of legislators behind it kept in check by the party whip while committee based legislatures in continental europe and those in presidential systems of the americas have more independence in drafting and amending bills
the origins of the power of the purse which legislatures typically have in passing or denying government budgets goes back to the european assemblies of nobility which the monarchs would have to consult before raising taxes
for this power to be actually effective the legislature should be able to amend the budget have an effective committee system enough time for consideration as well as access to relevant background information
the power of the legislature over the government is stronger
there are several ways in which the legislature can hold the government accountable including questioning interpellations and votes of confidence
in contrast to democratic systems legislatures under authoritarianism are used to ensure the stability of the power structure by co opting potential competing interests within the elites which they achieve cap by
providing legitimacy
incorporating opponents into the system
providing some representation of outside interests
offering a way to recruit new members to the ruling clique
being a channel through which limited grievances and concessions can be passed each chamber of the legislature consists of a number of legislators who use some form of parliamentary procedure to debate political issues and vote on proposed legislation
there must be a certain number of legislators present to carry out these activities this is called a quorum
some of the responsibilities of a legislature such as giving first consideration to newly proposed legislation are usually delegated to committees made up of a few of the members of the chamber s
the members of a legislature usually represent different political parties the members from each party generally meet as a caucus to organize their internal affairs
legislatures vary widely in the amount of political power they wield compared to other political players such as judiciaries militaries and executives
in political scientists m
steven fish and matthew kroenig constructed a parliamentary powers index in an attempt to quantify the different degrees of power among national legislatures
the german bundestag the italian parliament and the mongolian state great khural tied for most powerful while myanmar s house of representatives and somalia s transitional federal assembly since replaced by the federal parliament of somalia tied for least powerful
some political systems follow the principle of legislative supremacy which holds that the legislature is the supreme branch of government and cannot be bound by other institutions such as the judicial branch or a written constitution
such a system renders the legislature more powerful
in parliamentary and semi presidential systems of government the executive is responsible to the legislature which may remove it with a vote of no confidence
on the other hand according to the separation of powers doctrine the legislature in a presidential system is considered an independent and coequal branch of government along with both the judiciary and the executive
nevertheless many presidential systems provide for the impeachment of the executive for criminal or unconstitutional behaviour
legislatures will sometimes delegate their legislative power to administrative or executive agencies
legislatures are made up of individual members known as legislators who vote on proposed laws
a legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators this is often described as the number of seats it contains
for example a legislature that has seats has members
by extension an electoral district that elects a single legislator can also be described as a seat as for example in the phrases safe seat and marginal seat
after election the members may be protected by parliamentary immunity or parliamentary privilege either for all actions the duration of their entire term or for just those related to their legislative duties
a legislature may debate and vote upon bills as a single unit or it may be composed of multiple separate assemblies called by various names including legislative chambers debate chambers and houses which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers
a legislature which operates as a single unit is unicameral one divided into two chambers is bicameral and one divided into three chambers is tricameral
in bicameral legislatures one chamber is usually considered the upper house while the other is considered the lower house
the two types are not rigidly different but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected tend to be allocated by administrative divisions rather than by population and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house
in some systems particularly parliamentary systems the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role but in others particularly federal presidential systems the upper house has equal or even greater power
in federations the upper house typically represents the federation s component states
this is also the case with the supranational legislature of the european union
the upper house may either contain the delegates of state governments as in the european union and in germany and before in the united states or be elected according to a formula that grants equal representation to states with smaller populations as is the case in australia and the united states since
tricameral legislatures are rare the massachusetts governor s council still exists but the most recent national example existed in the waning years of white minority rule in south africa
tetracameral legislatures no longer exist but they were previously used in scandinavia
legislatures vary widely in their size
among national legislatures china s national people s congress is the largest with members while vatican city s pontifical commission is the smallest with
neither legislature is democratically elected the pontifical commission members are appointed by the pope and the national people s congress is indirectly elected within the context of a one party state
legislature size is a trade off between efficiency and representation the smaller the legislature the more efficiently it can operate but the larger the legislature the better it can represent the political diversity of its constituents
comparative analysis of national legislatures has found that size of a country s lower house tends to be proportional to the cube root of its population that is the size of the lower house tends to increase along with population but much more slowly
