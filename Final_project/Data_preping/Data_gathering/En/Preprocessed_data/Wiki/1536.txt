The Cambodian coup d'tat Khmer រដ្ឋប្រហារឆ្នាំ១៩៧០ French Coup d'tat de was the removal of the Cambodian Chief of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk after a vote in the National Assembly on March
Emergency powers were subsequently invoked by the Prime Minister Lon Nol who became effective head of state and led ultimately to the removal of Queen Sisowath Kossamak and the proclamation of the Khmer Republic later that year
It is generally seen as a turning point in the Cambodian Civil War
No longer a monarchy Cambodia was semi-officially called tat du Cambodge State of Cambodia in the intervening six months after the coup until the republic was proclaimed
It also marked the change of Cambodia involvement in the Vietnam War as Lon Nol issued an ultimatum to North Vietnamese forces to leave Cambodia
Since independence from France in Cambodia had been led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk whose Sangkum political movement had retained power after winning the parliamentary election
Following King Norodom Suramarit's death in Sihanouk had forced the National Assembly to approve a constitutional amendment that made him Chief of State with no fixed term of office while Queen Sisowath Kossamak remained a mere ceremonial figure
He had retained domestic power through a combination of political manipulation intimidation patronage and careful balancing of left- and right-wing elements within his government whilst placating the right with nationalist rhetoric he appropriated much of the language of socialism to marginalize the Cambodian communist movement whom he called the Khmers rouges Red Khmers
With the Second Indochina War escalating Sihanouk's balancing act between left and right became harder to maintain
Cross-border smuggling of rice also began to have a serious effect on the Cambodian economy
In the Cambodian elections of the usual Sangkum policy of having one candidate in each electoral district was abandoned there was a huge swing to the right especially as left-wing deputies had to compete directly with members of the traditional elite who were able to use their local influence
Although a few communists within the Sangkum such as Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan chose to stand most leftists were decisively defeated
Lon Nol a rightist who had been a longstanding associate of Sihanouk became Prime Minister
By Lon Nol and the rightists were growing increasingly frustrated with Sihanouk
Although the basis for this was partly economic political considerations were also involved
In particular the nationalist and anti-communist sensibilities of Lon Nol and his associates meant that Sihanouk's policy of semi-toleration of Viet Cong and People's Army of Vietnam PAVN activity within Cambodian borders was unacceptable Sihanouk during his swing to the left in had negotiated a secret arrangement with Hanoi whereby in return for the guaranteed purchase of rice at inflated prices the port of Sihanoukville was opened for weapons shipments to the Viet Cong
As well as the rightist nationalists the liberal modernising elements within the Sangkum headed by In Tam had also become increasingly alienated by Sihanouk's autocratic style
In March large-scale anti-Vietnamese demonstrations erupted in Phnom Penh while Sihanouk was touring Europe the Soviet Union and China
Crowds attacked the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong embassies
Sihanouk initially gave a certain degree of support to the demonstrators he hoped Moscow and Beijing would pressure North Vietnam to reduce its presence in Cambodia
Indeed it has even been suggested by William Shawcross and others that Sihanouk and Lon Nol may have planned the first demonstrations to gain political leverage against Hanoi
The riots however escalated beyond the government's control although this was likely done with a degree of encouragement from Lon Nol and Sirik Matak and the embassy was sacked
Inside a contingency plan was allegedly found for the communists to occupy Cambodia
On March Sirik Matak cancelled Sihanouk's trade agreement with North Vietnam Lon Nol closed the port of Sihanoukville to the North Vietnamese and issued an impossible ultimatum to them all PAVN and Viet Cong forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within hours on March or face military action
When by the morning of March it was clear that this demand had not been met some youths gathered outside the National Assembly in Phnom Penh to protest against the Vietnamese presence
From this point events were to move with increasing rapidity
On the same day the Cambodian Secretary of State for Defence Colonel Oum Mannorine Sihanouk's brother-in-law was scheduled to be questioned by the national legislature on allegations of corruption the proceedings were adjourned to hear the demonstrators' resolutions
According to Sihanouk Mannorine had received information that Lon Nol and Sirik Matak were about to precipitate a coup a group of Mannorine's men under the command of Phnom Penh's Chief of Police Major Buor Horl attempted to arrest the plotters but it was by then too late
Mannorine and other key security personnel loyal to Sihanouk were placed under arrest
After the Assembly adjourned for the day Sihanouk's mother Queen Kossamak at Sihanouk's request summoned Lon Nol and Sirik Matak to the Royal Palace and asked them to end the demonstrations
It appears to have been sometime during or March that Sirik Matak finally swayed Lon Nol to remove Sihanouk from the government
Lon Nol who until that point may have been merely hoping that Sihanouk would end his relations with North Vietnam showed some reluctance to take action against the Head of State to convince him Sirik Matak allegedly played him a tape-recorded press conference from Paris in which Sihanouk threatened to execute them both on his return to Phnom Penh
However the Prime Minister remained uncertain with the result that Sirik Matak accompanied by three army officers finally compelled a weeping Lon Nol to sign the necessary documents at gunpoint
The next day March the army took up positions around the capital and a debate was held within the National Assembly under In Tam's direction
One member of the Assembly Kim Phon later to be killed by pro-Sihanouk demonstrators in Kampong Cham walked out of the proceedings in protest though was not harmed at the time
The rest of the assembly voted unanimously to invoke Article of the Cambodian constitution which withdrew confidence in Sihanouk
Lon Nol took over the powers of the Head of State on an emergency basis while the position itself was taken by the President of the General Assembly Cheng Heng
In Tam was confirmed as President of the Sangkum
The removal of Sihanouk had therefore followed essentially constitutional forms rather than being a blatant military takeover
These events marked the foundation of the Khmer Republic
Queen Kossamak was forced to leave the royal palace by the new government and held in house arrest in a villa in the suburb before being allowed to join her son in Beijing in China for health reasons in and died there two years later
There is evidence that during Lon Nol approached the US military establishment to gauge military support for any action against Sihanouk
Lon Nol's appointee as deputy Prime Minister Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak a US-friendly nationalist and leader of the Cambodian business community is thought to have suggested that Sihanouk should be assassinated though Lon Nol rejected this plan as criminal insanity
Sihanouk himself thought that Sirik Matak who he characterised as a jealous rival claimant to the Cambodian throne backed by the US
Central Intelligence Agency CIA and in contact with exiled Sihanouk opponent Son Ngoc Thanh had suggested the coup plan to Lon Nol in
CIA involvement in the coup plot remains unproven and Henry Kissinger later claimed that events would take the US government by surprise but it now seems likely that at least some US
On March Sihanouk via Beijing Radio called for a general uprising against Lon Nol
Large-scale popular demonstrations calling for Sihanouk's return began in Kompong Cham Tako Province and Kampot Province
The demonstrations in Kompong Cham became particularly violent with two National Assembly deputies Sos Saoun and Kim Phon being killed by demonstrators on March after driving to the town to negotiate
Lon Nol's brother police official Lon Nil was set upon in the nearby town of Tonle Bet by plantation workers and was also killed
The demonstrations were suppressed with extreme brutality by the Cambodian army there were several hundred deaths and thousands of arrests
Some witnesses spoke of tanks being used against crowds of unarmed civilians
Following the coup North Vietnam forces invaded Cambodia in at the request of Khmer Rouge leader Nuon Chea
Thousands of Vietnamese were killed by Lon Nol's anti-communist forces and their bodies dumped in the Mekong River
Attacks against Vietnamese began after a demand by Lon Nol that all Vietnamese communists leave Cambodia
Phnom Penh's North Vietnamese embassy was ravaged by Cambodians
Of the approximately Vietnamese in Cambodia left the country and another were forcibly repatriated to South Vietnam reducing the estimated population of ethnic Vietnamese to just five months after the coup
These events marked the start of the Cambodian Civil War pitting Lon Nol's regime backed by US air power against the Khmer Rouge and North Vietnam
Lon Nol fled Cambodia in right before the Khmer Rouge's seizure of power
