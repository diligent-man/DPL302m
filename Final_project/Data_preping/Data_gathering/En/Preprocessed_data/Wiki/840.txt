Henry Egon Friedlander September October was a German-American Jewish historian of the Holocaust who was noted for his arguments in favor of broadening the scope of casualties of the Holocaust
Born in Berlin Germany to a Jewish family Friedlander moved to the United States in as a survivor of Auschwitz obtaining his BA in history at Temple University in and his MA and PhD at the University of Pennsylvania in and
From until his retirement in Friedlander served as a professor in the department of Judaic studies at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York
The son of physician Bernhard Fritz Friedlnder and Ruth Friedlnder ne Löwenthal Henry Friedlander was married to fellow historian Sybil Milton who has a German Studies Association memorial prize named after her
Friedlander argued that three groups should be considered victims of the Holocaust namely Jews Romani and the mentally and physically disabled noting that the latter were Nazism's first victims
His opinions concerning the inclusion of both the disabled and the Romani as victims of the Holocaust often gave rise to intense debates with other scholars such as the Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer who argued that only Jews should be considered victims of the Holocaust
Like Friedlander Sybil Milton supported a more expansive inclusive definition of the Holocaust arguing against the exclusivity of emphasis on Judeocide in most Holocaust literature that has generally excluded Gypsies as well as blacks and the handicapped from equal consideration and exchanging views on the topic with Yehuda Bauer
According to Friedlander the origins of the Holocaust can be traced back to the coming together of two lines of Nazi policies the antisemitic policies of the Nazi regime and its racial cleansing policies that led to the Action T program
Arguing that the ultimate origins of the Holocaust came from the Action T program he pointed to the fact that both the poison gas and the crematoria were originally deployed at the start of the Action T program in
It was only later in that the experts from the T program were imported by the SS to help design and later run the death camps for the Jews of Europe
Friedlander did not deny the importance of the Nazi's antisemitic ideology but in his view the T program was the crucial seed that gave birth to the Holocaust
