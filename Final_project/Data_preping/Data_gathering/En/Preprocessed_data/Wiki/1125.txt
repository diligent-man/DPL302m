The Piper J- Cub Coupe is a two place side-by-side version of the Piper J- that was built between and by Piper Aircraft
It was Piper's first model with side-by-side seating combined with docile low-speed handling this made it a good trainer
The fuselage of the J- was wider than the J- and the aircraft had a fully enclosed rear decking to the fuselage top
The first J-s had a Continental hp A engine with upward-facing exhaust ports an open cowl oil and spring landing gear a modified tail wheel system and many other changes
The early J- had a comfortable cockpit but was slower than most side by side aircraft of the day
The J-A gained a fully enclosed cowling a Continental hp A engine and aft auxiliary fuel
The J-B was fitted with a hp Franklin AC- engine
The final version was the J-E which sported a hp Continental engine and redesigned interior
The main fuel tank was moved to the wing along with a header tank
Performance was now on par with similar contemporary types but the attack on Pearl Harbor sealed its fate as all civilian aircraft manufacture came to a stop with the entry of the United States into World War II
Some J-s had another unique feature in the tail construction the stabilizer was made of stainless steel tubing riveted together with gussets
