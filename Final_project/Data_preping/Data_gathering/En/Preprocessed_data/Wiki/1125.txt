the piper j cub coupe is a two place side by side version of the piper j that was built between and by piper aircraft
it was piper s first model with side by side seating combined with docile low speed handling this made it a good trainer
the fuselage of the j was wider than the j and the aircraft had a fully enclosed rear decking to the fuselage top
the first j s had a continental hp a engine with upward facing exhaust ports an open cowl oil and spring landing gear a modified tail wheel system and many other changes
the early j had a comfortable cockpit but was slower than most side by side aircraft of the day
the j a gained a fully enclosed cowling a continental hp a engine and aft auxiliary fuel
the j b was fitted with a hp franklin ac engine
the final version was the j e which sported a hp continental engine and redesigned interior
the main fuel tank was moved to the wing along with a header tank
performance was now on par with similar contemporary types but the attack on pearl harbor sealed its fate as all civilian aircraft manufacture came to a stop with the entry of the united states into world war ii
some j s had another unique feature in the tail construction the stabilizer was made of stainless steel tubing riveted together with gussets
