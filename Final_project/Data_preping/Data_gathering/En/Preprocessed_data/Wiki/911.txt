negative campaigning is the process of deliberately spreading negative information about someone or something to worsen the public image of the described
a colloquial and somewhat more derogatory term for the practice is mudslinging
deliberate spreading of such information can be motivated either by honest desire of the campaigner to warn others against real dangers or deficiencies of the described or by the campaigner s dishonest ideas on methods of winning in political business or other spheres of competition against an honest rival
however if the mudslinging statements can be proved to be correct mudslinging takes the moral dimension of an opponent s duty serving the greater good by exposing the weakness of the other candidate
the public image of an entity can be defined as reputation esteem respect acceptance of the entity s appearance values and behaviour by the general public of a given territory and or a social group possibly within time limits
as target groups of public and their values differ so negativity or positivity of a public image is relative thus to be successful negative campaigning has to take into account current values of the group it addresses
the degree of strictness in practicing the group s values as opposed to its tolerance for violating the norms has also to be taken into consideration
there are a number of techniques used in negative campaigning
the most standard form of negative campaigning is campaign advertising that serves as an attack on an opponent s personality record or opinion
there are two main types of ads used in negative campaigning attack and contrast
attack ads focus exclusively on the negative aspects of the opponent
there is no positive content in an attack ad whether it is about the candidate or the opponent
attack ads usually identify the risks associated with the opponent often exploiting people s fears to manipulate
because attack ads have no positive content they have the potential to be more influential than contrast ads in shaping voters views of the sponsoring candidate s opponent
one of the most famous attack ads was daisy girl by the campaign of lyndon b
johnson that successfully portrayed republican barry goldwater as threatening nuclear war
common attack ad themes include painting an opponent as soft on criminals dishonest corrupt or a danger to the nation
another relatively common theme is attacking the other side for running a negative campaign
unlike attack ads contrast ads contain information about both the candidate and the opponent
the information about the candidate is positive while the information about the opponent is negative
contrast ads compare and contrast the candidate with the opponent juxtaposing the positive information about the candidate with the negative information of the opponent
because contrast ads must contain positive information contrast ads are seen as less damaging to the political process than attack ads
push polls are attacks disguised as telephone polls
they might ask a question like how would you react if candidate a was revealed to beat his wife giving the impression that candidate a might beat his wife
members of the media and of the opposing party are deliberately not called making these tactics all but invisible and unprovable
dirty tricks are also common in negative political campaigns
these generally involve secretly leaking damaging information to the media
this isolates a candidate from backlash and also does not cost any money
the material must be substantive enough to attract media interest however and if the truth is discovered it could severely damage a campaign
other dirty tricks include trying to feed an opponent s team false information hoping they will use it and embarrass themselves
often a campaign will use outside organizations such as lobby groups to launch attacks
these can be claimed to be coming from a neutral source and if the allegations turn out not to be true the attacking candidate will not be damaged if the links cannot be proven
negative campaigning can be conducted by proxy
for instance highly partisan ads were placed in the u s
presidential election by allegedly independent bodies like moveon org and swift boat veterans for truth
sponsors of overt negative campaigns often cite reasons to support mass communication of negative ideas
the office of national drug control policy uses negative campaigns to steer the public away from health risks
similar negative campaigns have been used to rebut mass marketing by tobacco companies or to discourage drunk driving
those who conduct negative political campaigns sometimes say the public needs to know about the person he or she is voting for even if it is bad
in other words if a candidate s opponent is a crook or a bad person then he or she should be able to tell the public about it
martin wattenberg and craig brians of the university of california irvine considered in their study whether negative campaigning mobilizes or alienates voters
they concluded that data used by stephen ansolabehere in a american political science review article to advance the hypothesis that negative campaigning demobilizes voters was flawed
a subsequent study done by ansolabehere and shanto iyengar in corrected some of the previous study s flaws
this study concluded that negative advertising suppressed voter turnout particularly for independent voters
they speculated that campaigns tend to go negative only if the independent vote is leaning toward the opponent
in doing so they insure that the swing voters stay home leaving the election up to base voters
they also found that negative ads have a greater impact on democrats than on republicans
according to them base republicans will vote no matter what and will vote only for a republican but democrats can be influenced to either stay home and not vote at all or to switch sides and vote for a republican
this combined with the effect negativity has on independents led them to conclude that republicans benefit more from going negative than democrats
other researchers have found different more positive outcomes from negative campaigns
rick farmer phd an assistant professor of political science at the university of akron found that negative ads are more memorable than positive ads when they reinforce a preexisting belief and are relevant to the central issues of a marketing campaign
researchers at the university of georgia found the impact of negative ads increases over time while positive ads used to counteract negative ads lack the power of negative ads
research also suggests negative campaigning introduces controversy and raises public awareness through additional news coverage
kyle mattes and david p
redlawsk in the positive case for negative campaigning show through surveys and experiments that negative campaigning may provide informational benefits for voters
without negativity voters would not have full information about all of their choices since no candidate will say anything bad about herself
they argue that candidates have to point out the flaws in their opponents for voters to be fully informed
most recent research distinguishes between a dichotomous positive versus negative and graded conceptualization of negative campaigning
the latter accounts for differences in the strength of negative communication
it argues that positive i e
information about parties and candidates and derogatory i e
democratic disaffection effects of negative campaigning will depend on the strength or intensity of negative campaigning
similarly political candidates and parties have been found to adapt the strength of their negative messages during election campaigns in order to preserve the chances for post electoral collaboration in countries with frequent coalition governments
some strategists say that an effect of negative campaigning is that while it motivates the base of support it can alienate centrist and undecided voters from the political process reducing voter turnout and radicalizing politics
in a study done by gina garramone about how negative advertising affects the political process it was found that a consequence of negative campaigning is greater image discrimination of the candidates and greater attitude polarization
while positive ads also contributed to the image discrimination and attitude polarization garramone found that negative campaigning played a more influential role in the discrimination and polarization than positive campaigning
negative ads can produce serious backlash
a disastrous ad was run by the progressive conservative party of canada in the canadian federal election apparently emphasizing liberal party of canada leader jean chr tien s partial facial paralysis which was caused by bell s palsy in a number of unflattering photos with the subtext of criticizing his platforms
chr tien took maximum advantage of the opportunity to gain the public s sympathy as a man who struggled with a physical disability and his party s subsequent overwhelming victory in the election helped reduce the governing progressive conservatives to two seats along with losing official party status
a similar backlash happened to the liberal party in the federal election for running an attack ad that suggested that conservative leader stephen harper would use canadian soldiers to patrol canadian cities and impose some kind of martial law
the ad was only available from the liberal party s web site for a few hours prior to the release of the attack ads on television nevertheless it was picked up by the media and widely criticized for its absurdity in particular the sentence we re not making this up we re not allowed to make this stuff up
liberal mp keith martin expressed his disapproval of whoever the idiot who approved that ad was shortly before liberal leader paul martin no relation stated that he had personally approved them
the effect of the ads was to diminish the credibility of the party s other attack ads
it offended many canadians particularly those in the military some of whom were fighting in afghanistan at the time
see canadian federal election
in the us senate race in north carolina republican incumbent elizabeth dole attempted an attack ad on democratic challenger kay hagan who had taken a small lead in polls by tying her to atheists
dole s campaign released an ad questioning hagan s religion and it included a voice saying there is no god over a picture of kay hagan s face
the voice was not hagan s but it is believed the ad implied that it was
initially it was thought the ad would work as religion has historically been a very important issue to voters in the american south but the ad produced a backlash across the state and hagan responded forcefully with an ad saying that she was a sunday school teacher and was a religious person
hagan also claimed dole was trying to change the subject from the economy the ad appeared during the great recession
hagan s lead in polls doubled and she won the race by a nine point margin
because of the possible harm that can come from being seen as a negative campaigner candidates often pledge to refrain from negative attacks
this pledge is usually abandoned when an opponent is perceived to be going negative with the first retaliatory attack being ironically an accusation that the opponent is a negative campaigner
while some research has found advantages and other has found disadvantages some studies find no difference between negative and positive approaches
research published in the journal of advertising found that negative political advertising makes the body want to turn away physically but the mind remembers negative messages
the findings are based on research conducted by james angelini professor of communication at the university of delaware in collaboration with samuel bradley assistant professor of advertising at texas tech university and sungkyoung lee of indiana university which used ads that aired during the presidential election
during the study the researchers placed electrodes under the eyes of willing participants and showed them a series of second ads from both the george w
bush and al gore campaigns
the electrodes picked up on the startle response the automatic eye movement typically seen in response to snakes spiders and other threats
compared to positive or neutral messages negative advertising prompted greater reflex reactions and a desire to move away
studies have shown a variety of different negativity s predictors
some of the negativity s drivers stated are the attacker s personality traits big five dark triad populism the media environment and election related factors competitiveness a candidate s rank in polls type of election party system
in united states politics negative campaigning has been called as american as mississippi mud and as american as apple pie
some research suggests negative campaigning is the norm in all political venues mitigated only by the dynamics of a particular contest
gordon liddy played a major role in developing these tactics during the nixon campaign playing an important advisory of rules that led to the campaign of
james carville campaign manager of bill clinton s election is also a major proponent of negative tactics
