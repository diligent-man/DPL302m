it is a subsidiary of walt disney studios a division of the walt disney company
walt disney studios motion pictures distributes and markets the films made under the th century studios banner
for over years beginning with its founding in and ending in when it was bought out by walt disney studios th century fox was one of the then big six major american film studios
it was formed in from the merger of the fox film corporation and twentieth century pictures and was originally known as the twentieth century fox film corporation while being owned by tcf holdings as one of the original big five among eight majors of hollywood s golden age
in the studio was renamed as twentieth century fox film corporation without a hyphen after being acquired by news corporation which was shut down and succeeded by st century fox in after spinning off its publishing assets
the acquisition of st century fox by disney took place on march including th century fox
the studio s current name was adopted on january in order to avoid confusion with fox corporation
on december the company started using th century studios inc
for the copyright of th century studios and searchlight pictures productions as a disney subsidiary
twentieth century pictures joseph schenck and darryl f
zanuck left united artists over a stock dispute and began merger talks with the management of financially struggling fox film under president sidney kent
spyros skouras then manager of the fox west coast theaters helped make it happen and later became president of the new company
the company had been struggling since founder william fox lost control of the company in
fox film corporation and twentieth century pictures merged together in
initially it was speculated in the new york times that the newly merged company would be named fox th century pictures
however th century brought more to the bargaining table besides schenck and zanuck as it was profitable and had more talent than fox
the new company th century fox film corporation began trading on may
kent remained at the company joining schenck and zanuck thanks to skouras
zanuck replaced winfield sheehan as the company s production chief
the company established a special training school
lynn bari patricia farr and anne nagel were among young women launched on the trail of film stardom on august when they each received a six month contract with th century fox after spending months in the school
the contracts included a studio option for renewal for as long as seven years
for many years th century fox claimed to have been founded in the year fox film was founded
for instance it marked as its th anniversary
however it has claimed the merger as its founding in recent years even though most film historians agree it was founded in
the company s films retained the th century pictures searchlight logo on their opening credits as well as its opening fanfare but with the name changed to th century fox
after the merger was completed zanuck signed young actors to help carry th century fox tyrone power linda darnell carmen miranda don ameche henry fonda gene tierney sonja henie and betty grable
th century fox also hired alice faye and shirley temple who appeared in several major films for the studio in the s
higher attendance during world war ii helped th century fox overtake rko and metro goldwyn mayer to become the third most profitable film studio
in zanuck was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the u s
signal corps and assigned to supervise the production of u s
army training films
his partner william goetz filled in at th century fox
in spyros skouras succeeded kent as president of the studio
during the next few years with pictures like wilson the razor s edge boomerang gentleman s agreement both the snake pit and pinky zanuck established a reputation for provocative adult films
th century fox also specialized in adaptations of best selling books such as ben ames williams leave her to heaven starring gene tierney which was the highest grossing th century fox film of the s
the studio also produced film versions of broadway musicals including the rodgers and hammerstein films beginning with the musical version of state fair the only work that the partnership wrote especially for films
after the war audiences slowly drifted away with the advent of television
th century fox held on to its theaters until a court mandated divorce they were spun off as fox national theaters in
that year with attendance at half the level th century fox gambled on an unproven process
noting that the two film sensations of had been cinerama which required three projectors to fill a giant curved screen and natural vision d which got its effects of depth by requiring the use of polarized glasses th century fox mortgaged its studio to buy rights to a french anamorphic projection system which gave a slight illusion of depth without glasses
president spyros skouras struck a deal with the inventor henri chr tien leaving the other film studios empty handed and in introduced cinemascope in the studio s groundbreaking feature film the robe
zanuck announced in february that henceforth all th century fox pictures would be made in cinemascope
to convince theater owners to install this new process th century fox agreed to help pay conversion costs about per screen and to ensure enough product th century fox leased access to cinemascope to any rival studio choosing to use it
seeing the box office for the first two cinemascope features the robe and how to marry a millionaire also warner bros mgm rko universal international columbia ua allied artists and disney quickly adopted the process
in th century fox engaged robert lippert to establish a subsidiary company regal pictures later associated producers incorporated to film b pictures in cinemascope but branded regalscope
th century fox produced new musicals using the cinemascope process including carousel and the king and i both
cinemascope brought a brief upturn in attendance but by the numbers again began to slide
that year darryl zanuck announced his resignation as head of production
zanuck moved to paris setting up as an independent producer seldom being in the united states for many years
zanuck s successor producer buddy adler died a year later
president spyros skouras brought in a series of production executives but none had zanuck s success
by the early s th century fox was in trouble
a new version of cleopatra began production in with joan collins in the lead
as a publicity gimmick producer walter wanger offered million to elizabeth taylor if she would star she accepted and costs for cleopatra began to escalate
richard burton s on set romance with taylor was surrounding the media
however skouras selfish preferences and inexperienced micromanagement on the film s production did nothing to speed up production on cleopatra
meanwhile another remake of the cary grant hit my favorite wife was rushed into production in an attempt to turn over a quick profit to help keep th century fox afloat
the romantic comedy entitled something s got to give paired marilyn monroe th century fox s most bankable star of the s with dean martin and director george cukor
the troubled monroe caused delays daily and it quickly descended into a costly debacle
as cleopatra s budget passed million eventually costing around million th century fox sold its back lot now the site of century city to alcoa in to raise funds
after several weeks of script rewrites on the monroe picture and very little progress mostly due to director george cukor s filming methods in addition to monroe s chronic sinusitis monroe was fired from something s got to give and two months later she was found dead
according to th century fox files she was rehired within weeks for a two picture deal totaling million to finish something s got to give plus a bonus at completion and another for what a way to go
elizabeth taylor s bout with pneumonia and the media coverage of the burton affair allowed skouras to scapegoat the two stars for all the production setbacks which helped earn the long time industry professional taylor a new disruptive reputation
challenges on the cleopatra set continued from into though three th century fox executives went to rome in june to fire her
they learned that director joseph l
mankiewicz had filmed out of sequence and had only done interiors so th century fox was then forced to allow taylor several more weeks of filming
in the meantime during that summer of fox released nearly all of its contract stars to offset burgeoning costs including jayne mansfield
with few pictures on the schedule skouras wanted to rush zanuck s big budget war epic the longest day an accurate account of the allied invasion of normandy on june with a huge international cast into release as another source of quick cash
this offended zanuck still th century fox s largest shareholder for whom the longest day was a labor of love that he had dearly wanted to produce for many years
after it became clear that something s got to give would not be able to progress without monroe in the lead martin had refused to work with anyone else skouras finally decided that re signing her was unavoidable
but days before filming was due to resume she was found dead at her los angeles home and the picture resumed filming as move over darling with doris day and james garner in the leads
released in the film was a hit
the unfinished scenes from something s got to give were shelved for nearly years
rather than being rushed into release as if it were a b picture the longest day was lovingly and carefully produced under zanuck s supervision
it was finally released at a length of three hours and was well received
at the next board meeting zanuck spoke for eight hours convincing directors that skouras was mismanaging the company and that he was the only possible successor
zanuck was installed as chairman and then named his son richard zanuck as president
this new management group seized cleopatra and rushed it to completion shut down the studio laid off the entire staff to save money axed the long running movietone newsreel the archives of which are now owned by fox news and made a series of cheap popular pictures that restored th century fox as a major studio
the saving grace for the studio s fortunes came from the tremendous success of the sound of music an expensive and handsomely produced film adaptation of the highly acclaimed rodgers and hammerstein broadway musical which became a significant success at the box office and won five academy awards including best director robert wise and best picture of the year
th century fox also had two big science fiction hits in the decade fantastic voyage and the original planet of the apes starring charlton heston kim hunter and roddy mcdowall
fantastic voyage was the last film made in cinemascope the studio had held on to the format while panavision lenses were being used elsewhere
zanuck stayed on as chairman until but there were several expensive flops in his last years resulting in th century fox posting losses from to
following his removal and after an uncertain period new management brought th century fox back to health
under president gordon t
stulberg and production head alan ladd jr th century fox films connected with modern audiences
stulberg used the profits to acquire resort properties soft drink bottlers australian theaters and other properties in an attempt to diversify enough to offset the boom or bust cycle of picture making
foreshadowing a pattern of film production still yet to come in late th century fox joined forces with warner bros
to co produce the towering inferno an all star action blockbuster from producer irwin allen
both studios found themselves owning the rights to books about burning skyscrapers
allen insisted on a meeting with the heads of both studios and announced that as th century fox was already in the lead with their property it would be career suicide to have competing movies
thus the first joint venture studio deal was struck
in hindsight while it may be commonplace now back in the s it was a risky but revolutionary idea that paid off handsomely at both domestic and international box offices around the world
th century fox s success reached new heights by backing the most profitable film made up to that time star wars
substantial financial gains were realized as a result of the film s unprecedented success from a low of in june stock prices more than quadrupled to almost after star wars release revenues of million rose to million in
with financial stability came new owners when th century fox was sold for million on june to investors marc rich and marvin davis
th century fox s assets included pebble beach golf links the aspen skiing company and a century city property upon which davis built and twice sold fox plaza
by rich had become a fugitive from justice having fled to switzerland after being charged by u s
federal prosecutors with tax evasion racketeering and illegal trading with iran during the iran hostage crisis
rich s assets were frozen by u s
authorities
in marvin davis bought out marc rich s interest in th century fox film corporation for an undisclosed amount reported to be million
davis sold this interest to rupert murdoch s news corporation for million in march
davis later backed out of a deal with murdoch to purchase john kluge s metromedia television stations
murdoch went ahead alone and bought the stations and later bought out davis remaining stake in th century fox for million
from the hyphen was permanently deleted from the brand name with th century fox changing to th century fox
in th century fox shuttered the tlc films division down after only three years of which they had been started in
to gain fcc approval of th century fox s purchase of metromedia s television holdings once the stations of the long dissolved dumont network murdoch had to become a u s
citizen
he did so in and in the new fox broadcasting company took to the air
