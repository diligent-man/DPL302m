the town s area is about km sq mi which is significantly larger than the numerous small towns in the department of aude
the rivers aude fresquel and the canal du midi flow through the town
the first signs of settlement in this region have been dated to about bc but the hill site of carsac a celtic place name that has been retained at other sites in the south became an important trading place in the sixth century bc

carcas on a column near the narbonne gate is of modern invention

carcassonne became strategically identified when the romans fortified the hilltop around bc and eventually made the colonia of julia carsaco later carcasum by the process of swapping consonants known as metathesis
the main part of the lower courses of the northern ramparts dates from gallo roman times
in the romans officially ceded septimania to the visigothic king theodoric ii who had held carcassonne since
he built more fortifications at carcassonne which was a frontier post on the northern marches traces of them still stand
theodoric is thought to have begun the predecessor of the basilica that is now dedicated to saint nazaire
in the visigoths successfully foiled attacks by the frankish king clovis
saracens from barcelona took carcassonne in
king pepin the short p pin le bref drove them away in
a medieval fiefdom the county of carcassonne controlled the city and its environs
it was often united with the county of raz s
the origins of carcassonne as a county probably lie in local representatives of the visigoths but the first count known by name is bello of the time of charlemagne
bello founded a dynasty the bellonids which would rule many honores in septimania and catalonia for three centuries
in carcassonne became the property of raimond bernard trencavel viscount of albi and n mes through his marriage with ermengard sister of the last count of carcassonne
in the following centuries the trencavel family allied in succession with either the counts of barcelona or of toulouse
they built the ch teau comtal and the basilica of saints nazarius and celsus
in pope urban ii blessed the foundation stones of the new cathedral
carcassonne became famous for its role in the albigensian crusades when the city was a stronghold of occitan cathars
in august the crusading army of the papal legate abbot arnaud amalric forced its citizens to surrender
viscount raymond roger de trencavel was imprisoned whilst negotiating his city s surrender and died in mysterious circumstances three months later in his own dungeon
the people of carcassonne were allowed to leave in effect expelled from their city with nothing more than the shirt on their backs
simon de montfort was appointed the new viscount and added to the fortifications
in trencavel s son tried to reconquer his old domain but in vain
the city submitted to the rule of the kingdom of france in
carcassonne became a border fortress between france and the crown of aragon under the treaty of corbeil
king louis ix founded the new part of the town across the river
he and his successor philip iii built the outer ramparts
contemporary opinion still considered the fortress impregnable
during the hundred years war edward the black prince failed to take the city in although his troops destroyed the lower town
in the treaty of the pyrenees transferred the border province of roussillon to france and carcassonne s military significance was reduced
its fortifications were abandoned and the city became mainly an economic center that concentrated on the woollen textile industry for which a source quoted by fernand braudel found it the manufacturing center of languedoc
it remained so until the ottoman market collapsed at the end of the eighteenth century thereafter reverting to a country town
carcassonne was the first fortress to use hoardings in times of siege
temporary wooden platforms and walls would be fitted to the upper walls of the fortress through square holes in the face of the wall providing protection to defenders on the wall and allowing defenders to go out past the wall to drop projectiles on attackers at the wall beneath acting much like permanent machicolation
the fortified city consists essentially of a concentric design of two outer walls with towers and barbicans to prevent attack by siege engines
the castle itself possesses its own drawbridge and ditch leading to a central keep
the walls consist of towers built over quite a long period
one section is roman and is notably different from the medieval walls with the tell tale red brick layers and the shallow pitch terracotta tile roofs
one of these towers housed the catholic inquisition in the th century and is still known as the inquisition tower
carcassonne was demilitarised under napoleon bonaparte and the restoration and the fortified cit of carcassonne fell into such disrepair that the french government decided that it should be demolished
a decree to that effect that was made official in caused an uproar
the antiquary and mayor of carcassonne jean pierre cros mayrevieille and the writer prosper m rim e the first inspector of ancient monuments led a campaign to preserve the fortress as a historical monument
later in the year the architect eug ne viollet le duc already at work restoring the basilica of saints nazarius and celsus was commissioned to renovate the place
in work began with the west and southwest walls followed by the towers of the porte narbonnaise and the principal entrance to the cit
the fortifications were consolidated here and there but the chief attention was paid to restoring the roofing of the towers and the ramparts where viollet le duc ordered the destruction of structures that had encroached against the walls some of them of considerable age
viollet le duc left copious notes and drawings upon his death in when his pupil paul boeswillwald and later the architect nodet continued the rehabilitation of carcassonne
the restoration was strongly criticized during viollet le duc s lifetime
fresh from work in the north of france he made the error of using slate when there was no slate to be quarried around instead of terracotta tiles
the slate roofs were claimed to be more typical of northern france as was the addition of the pointed tips to the roofs
yet overall viollet le duc s achievement at carcassonne is agreed to be a work of genius though not of the strictest authenticity
the ville basse dates to the late medeival period
founded as a settlement of the expelled inhabitants of the town some time after the crusades it has been the it has been the economic heart of the city for centuries
though once walled most of the walls in this portion of the town are no longer intact
