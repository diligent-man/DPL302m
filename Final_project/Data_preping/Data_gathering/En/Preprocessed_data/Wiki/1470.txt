the newlands resolution was a joint resolution passed on july by the united states congress to annex the independent republic of hawaii
in congress created the territory of hawaii
the resolution was drafted by representative francis g
newlands of nevada a democrat
annexation was a highly controversial political issue along with the similar issue of the acquisition of the philippines in
in us president william mckinley signed a treaty of annexation for the republic of hawaii which was never ratified by the united states
in april the united states went to war with spain and the republic of hawaii declared its neutrality
in practice hawaii gave enormous support to the united states which demonstrated its value as a naval base in wartime and won widespread american approval for its non neutral behavior
with the opposition weakened hawaii was annexed by the newlands resolution by way of congressional executive agreement method which requires only a majority vote in both houses
although the bill was authored by a democrat most of its support came from republicans
it passed the house by a vote of to supporters included republicans
it passed the senate by a two thirds majority vote of
it was approved on july and signed on july by mckinley
on august a ceremony was held on the steps of iolani palace to signify the official transfer of hawaiian state sovereignty to the united states
some hawaiian citizens did not recognize the event s legitimacy and did not attend
the resolution established a five member commission to study the laws that were needed in hawaii
the commission included territorial governor sanford b
dole r hawaii territory senators shelby m
cullom r il and john t
morgan d al representative robert r
hitt r il and former hawaii chief justice and later territorial governor walter f
frear r hawaii territory
the commission s final report was submitted to congress for a debate that lasted over a year
congress raised objections that establishing an elected territorial government in hawaii would lead to the admission of a state with a non white majority
annexation allowed duty free trade between the islands and the mainland although this had mostly already been accomplished through a reciprocity trade deal king david kalakaua had made with the u s
in and in exchange gave the u s
navy a long term lease of pearl harbor for a naval base
the creation of the territory of hawaii was the final step in a long history of dwindling hawaiian sovereignty and divided the local population
the annexation was opposed by some among the polynesian population and occurred without a referendum of any kind
debate between anti sovereignty and sovereignty activists still exists over the legality of the acquisition of hawaii under the us constitution
the hawaiian sovereignty movement views the annexation as illegal
however the u s
supreme court gave tacit recognition to the legitimacy of hawaii s annexation in de lima v
bidwell u s
the united states assumed million in hawaiian debt as part of the annexation
david r
barker of the university of iowa stated in that unlike the alaska purchase hawaii has been profitable for the country with net tax revenue almost always exceeding non defense spending
he estimated an internal rate of return for the annexation of more than
multiple viewpoints in the united states and in hawaii were raised for and against annexation from to
historian henry graff wrote that at first public opinion at home seemed to indicate acquiescence
unmistakably the sentiment at home was maturing with immense force for the united states to join the great powers of the world in a quest for overseas colonies
president grover cleveland on taking office in march rescinded the annexation proposal
his biographer alyn brodsky argued that it was a deeply personal conviction on cleveland s part to an immoral action against the little kingdom
just as he stood up for the samoan islands against germany because he opposed the conquest of a lesser state by a greater one so did he stand up for the hawaiian islands against his own nation
he could have let the annexation of hawaii move inexorably to its inevitable culmination
but he opted for confrontation which he hated as it was to him the only way a weak and defenseless people might retain their independence
it was not the idea of annexation that grover cleveland opposed but the idea of annexation as a pretext for illicit territorial acquisition cleveland had to mobilize support from southern democrats to fight the treaty
he sent former georgia representative james h
blount as a special representative to hawaii to investigate and to provide a solution
blount was well known for his opposition to imperialism
blount was also a leader for white supremacy which ended the right to vote by southern blacks in the s
some observers had speculated that he would support annexation on the grounds of the inability of asiatics to govern themselves
instead blount opposed imperialism called for the us military to restore queen liliuokalani and argued that the hawaii natives should be allowed to continue their asiatic ways
blount seemingly was unaware of the written policy set for hawaii in cleveland s first term by his secretary of state thomas f
bayard for hawaii
bayard sent written instructions to the american minister george w
merrill that in the event of another revolution in hawaii it was a priority to protect american commerce lives and property
bayard specified that the assistance of the officers of our government vessels if found necessary will therefore be promptly afforded to promote the reign of law and respect for orderly government in hawaii in july during a small scale rebellion merrill landed marines to protect americans an action that the state department explicitly approved
stevens had read those instructions and followed them in
a vigorous nationwide anti expansionist movement organized as the american anti imperialist league emerged that listened to cleveland and carl schurz as well as democratic leader william jennings bryan industrialist andrew carnegie author mark twain and sociologist william graham sumner and many prominent intellectuals and politicians who came of age during the civil war
the anti imperialists opposed expansion and believed that imperialism violated the fundamental principle that just republican government derives from consent of the governed the league argued that such activity would necessitate the abandonment of american ideals of self government and non intervention that were expressed in the declaration of independence george washington s farewell address and lincoln s gettysburg address
however they could not stop the even more energetic forces of imperialism which were led by secretary of state john hay naval strategist alfred t
mahan republican senator henry cabot lodge secretary of war elihu root and the young politician theodore roosevelt
those expansionists had vigorous support from newspaper publishers william randolph hearst and joseph pulitzer who whipped up popular excitement
there was deep concern that japan would take over hawaii as part of its colonial empire which would pose a serious threat to the west coast
mahan and roosevelt designed a global strategy calling for a competitive modern navy pacific bases an isthmian canal through nicaragua or panama and above all an assertive role for america as the largest industrial power
mckinley s position was that hawaii could never survive on its own but would quickly be gobbled up by japan since already a fourth of the islands population was japanese
that would allow japan to dominate the pacific and undermine american hopes for large scale trade with asia
