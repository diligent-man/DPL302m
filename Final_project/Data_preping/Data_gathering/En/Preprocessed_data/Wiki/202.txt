reeves next leading role came in the cyberpunk action thriller johnny mnemonic directed by artist robert longo and based on the story of the same name by william gibson
the template for the matrix the wachowskis recalled had been johnny mnemonic and it set the stage for decades worth of movie tropes set in it is
about a man who has had a cybernetic brain implant while prophetically a tech induced pandemic ravages a planet awash with conspiracies
the yakuza are hired to kill johnny by an evil corporation who knows that what is in johnny s head can cure the pandemic cutting into their profits
the film is considered a classic example of hollywood execs greenlighting a film with an artist at the helm then steamrollering over their unique creative vision
by all accounts it was an embattled production and it is a testament to longo s genius that so much of his eccentric intention survived even after the film was recut by the studio
and longo s internalisation of the comic book aesthetic also seems to have wrong footed critics at the time who called it blade runner with tackier sets the film received mainly negative reviews and critics felt reeves was woefully miscast for an acting style that became his signature over the years the peculiarities of reeves s acting style have come to be seen more generously the film is one of the great goofy gestures of recent cinema a movie that doesn t deserve one nanosecond of serious analysis but has a kind of idiotic grandeur that makes you almost forgive it and has been a major influence on the science fiction genre

the sunday times critic roger lewis believed his performance writing he quite embodied the innocence the splendid fury the animal grace of the leaps and bounds the emotional violence that form the prince of denmark
he is one of the top three hamlets i have seen for a simple reason he is hamlet
reeves was soon drawn to science fiction roles appearing in chain reaction with co stars morgan freeman rachel weisz fred ward kevin dunn and brian cox
