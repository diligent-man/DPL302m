in mathematical logic a tautology from greek is a formula or assertion that is true in every possible interpretation
an example is x y or x y
similarly either the ball is green or the ball is not green is always true regardless of the colour of the ball
the philosopher ludwig wittgenstein first applied the term to redundancies of propositional logic in borrowing from rhetoric where a tautology is a repetitive statement
in logic a formula is satisfiable if it is true under at least one interpretation and thus a tautology is a formula whose negation is unsatisfiable
in other words it cannot be false
it cannot be untrue
unsatisfiable statements both through negation and affirmation are known formally as contradictions
a formula that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is said to be logically contingent
such a formula can be made either true or false based on the values assigned to its propositional variables
the double turnstile notation
displaystyle vdash s
is used to indicate that s is a tautology
tautology is sometimes symbolized by vpq and contradiction by opq
the tee symbol
displaystyle top
is sometimes used to denote an arbitrary tautology with the dual symbol
displaystyle bot
falsum representing an arbitrary contradiction in any symbolism a tautology may be substituted for the truth value true as symbolized for instance by
tautologies are a key concept in propositional logic where a tautology is defined as a propositional formula that is true under any possible boolean valuation of its propositional variables
a key property of tautologies in propositional logic is that an effective method exists for testing whether a given formula is always satisfied equiv whether its negation is unsatisfiable
the definition of tautology can be extended to sentences in predicate logic which may contain quantifiers a feature absent from sentences of propositional logic
indeed in propositional logic there is no distinction between a tautology and a logically valid formula
in the context of predicate logic many authors define a tautology to be a sentence that can be obtained by taking a tautology of propositional logic and uniformly replacing each propositional variable by a first order formula one formula per propositional variable
the set of such formulas is a proper subset of the set of logically valid sentences of predicate logic i e sentences that are true in every model
the word tautology was used by the ancient greeks to describe a statement that was asserted to be true merely by virtue of saying the same thing twice a pejorative meaning that is still used for rhetorical tautologies
between and the word gained new meaning in logic and is currently used in mathematical logic to denote a certain type of propositional formula without the pejorative connotations it originally possessed
in immanuel kant wrote in his book logic
here analytic proposition refers to an analytic truth a statement in natural language that is true solely because of the terms involved
in gottlob frege proposed in his grundlagen that a truth is analytic exactly if it can be derived using logic
however he maintained a distinction between analytic truths i e truths based only on the meanings of their terms and tautologies i e statements devoid of content
in his tractatus logico philosophicus in ludwig wittgenstein proposed that statements that can be deduced by logical deduction are tautological empty of meaning as well as being analytic truths
henri poincar had made similar remarks in science and hypothesis in
although bertrand russell at first argued against these remarks by wittgenstein and poincar claiming that mathematical truths were not only non tautologous but were synthetic he later spoke in favor of them in
here logical proposition refers to a proposition that is provable using the laws of logic
during the s the formalization of the semantics of propositional logic in terms of truth assignments was developed
the term tautology began to be applied to those propositional formulas that are true regardless of the truth or falsity of their propositional variables
some early books on logic such as symbolic logic by c
lewis and langford used the term for any proposition in any formal logic that is universally valid
it is common in presentations after this such as stephen kleene and herbert enderton to use tautology to refer to a logically valid propositional formula but to maintain a distinction between tautology and logically valid in the context of first order logic see below
propositional logic begins with propositional variables atomic units that represent concrete propositions
a formula consists of propositional variables connected by logical connectives built up in such a way that the truth of the overall formula can be deduced from the truth or falsity of each variable
a valuation is a function that assigns each propositional variable to either t for truth or f for falsity
so by using the propositional variables a and b the binary connectives
displaystyle lor
displaystyle land
representing disjunction and conjunction respectively and the unary connective
displaystyle lnot
representing negation the following formula can be obtained
displaystyle a land b lor lnot a lor lnot b
a valuation here must assign to each of a and b either t or f
but no matter how this assignment is made the overall formula will come out true
for if the first conjunction
displaystyle a land b
is not satisfied by a particular valuation then one of a and b is assigned f which will make one of the following disjunct to be assigned t
a formula of propositional logic is a tautology if the formula itself is always true regardless of which valuation is used for the propositional variables
there are infinitely many tautologies
examples include
displaystyle a lor lnot a
a or not a the law of excluded middle
this formula has only one propositional variable a
any valuation for this formula must by definition assign a one of the truth values true or false and assign
displaystyle lnot
a the other truth value
for instance the cat is black or the cat is not black
displaystyle a to b leftrightarrow lnot b to lnot a
if a implies b then not b implies not a and vice versa which expresses the law of contraposition
for instance if it s a book it is blue if it s not blue it s not a book
displaystyle lnot a to b land lnot a to lnot b to a
if not a implies both b and its negation not b then not a must be false then a must be true which is the principle known as reductio ad absurdum
for instance if it s not blue it s a book if it s not blue it s also not a book so it is blue
displaystyle lnot a land b leftrightarrow lnot a lor lnot b
if not both a and b then not a or not b and vice versa which is known as de morgan s law
if it s either not a book or it s not blue it s either not a book or it s not blue or neither
displaystyle a to b land b to c to a to c
if a implies b and b implies c then a implies c which is the principle known as syllogism
if it s a book then it s blue if it s blue it s on that shelf
hence if it s a book it s on that shelf
displaystyle a lor b land a to c land b to c to c
if at least one of a or b is true and each implies c then c must be true as well which is the principle known as proof by cases
books and blue things are on that shelf
if it s either a book or it s blue it s on that shelf a minimal tautology is a tautology that is not the instance of a shorter tautology
displaystyle a lor b to a lor b
is a tautology but not a minimal one because it is an instantiation of
displaystyle c to c
the problem of determining whether a formula is a tautology is fundamental in propositional logic
if there are n variables occurring in a formula then there are distinct valuations for the formula
therefore the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one one needs only to evaluate the truth value of the formula under each of its possible valuations
one algorithmic method for verifying that every valuation makes the formula to be true is to make a truth table that includes every possible valuation
for example consider the formula
displaystyle a land b to c leftrightarrow a to b to c
there are possible valuations for the propositional variables a b c represented by the first three columns of the following table
the remaining columns show the truth of subformulas of the formula above culminating in a column showing the truth value of the original formula under each valuation
because each row of the final column shows t the sentence in question is verified to be a tautology
it is also possible to define a deductive system i e proof system for propositional logic as a simpler variant of the deductive systems employed for first order logic see kleene sec for one such system
a proof of a tautology in an appropriate deduction system may be much shorter than a complete truth table a formula with n propositional variables requires a truth table with lines which quickly becomes infeasible as n increases
proof systems are also required for the study of intuitionistic propositional logic in which the method of truth tables cannot be employed because the law of the excluded middle is not assumed
a formula r is said to tautologically imply a formula s if every valuation that causes r to be true also causes s to be true
this situation is denoted
displaystyle r models s
it is equivalent to the formula
displaystyle r to s
being a tautology kleene p
for example let
displaystyle s
displaystyle a land b lor lnot b
displaystyle s
is not a tautology because any valuation that makes
displaystyle a
false will make
displaystyle s
false
but any valuation that makes
displaystyle a
true will make
displaystyle s
true because
displaystyle b lor lnot b
is a tautology
displaystyle r
be the formula
displaystyle a land c
displaystyle r models s
because any valuation satisfying
displaystyle r
will make
displaystyle a
true and thus makes
displaystyle s
it follows from the definition that if a formula
displaystyle r
is a contradiction then
displaystyle r
tautologically implies every formula because there is no truth valuation that causes
displaystyle r
to be true and so the definition of tautological implication is trivially satisfied
similarly if
displaystyle s
is a tautology then
displaystyle s
is tautologically implied by every formula
there is a general procedure the substitution rule that allows additional tautologies to be constructed from a given tautology kleene sec
suppose that s is a tautology and for each propositional variable a in s a fixed sentence sa is chosen
then the sentence obtained by replacing each variable a in s with the corresponding sentence sa is also a tautology
for example let s be the tautology
displaystyle a land b lor lnot a lor lnot b
let sa be
displaystyle c lor d
and let sb be
displaystyle c to e
it follows from the substitution rule that the sentence
displaystyle c lor d land c to e lor lnot c lor d lor lnot c to e
an axiomatic system is complete if every tautology is a theorem derivable from axioms
an axiomatic system is sound if every theorem is a tautology
the problem of constructing practical algorithms to determine whether sentences with large numbers of propositional variables are tautologies is an area of contemporary research in the area of automated theorem proving
the method of truth tables illustrated above is provably correct the truth table for a tautology will end in a column with only t while the truth table for a sentence that is not a tautology will contain a row whose final column is f and the valuation corresponding to that row is a valuation that does not satisfy the sentence being tested
this method for verifying tautologies is an effective procedure which means that given unlimited computational resources it can always be used to mechanistically determine whether a sentence is a tautology
this means in particular the set of tautologies over a fixed finite or countable alphabet is a decidable set
as an efficient procedure however truth tables are constrained by the fact that the number of valuations that must be checked increases as where k is the number of variables in the formula
this exponential growth in the computation length renders the truth table method useless for formulas with thousands of propositional variables as contemporary computing hardware cannot execute the algorithm in a feasible time period
the problem of determining whether there is any valuation that makes a formula true is the boolean satisfiability problem the problem of checking tautologies is equivalent to this problem because verifying that a sentence s is a tautology is equivalent to verifying that there is no valuation satisfying
displaystyle lnot s
it is known that the boolean satisfiability problem is np complete and widely believed that there is no polynomial time algorithm that can perform it
consequently tautology is co np complete
current research focuses on finding algorithms that perform well on special classes of formulas or terminate quickly on average even though some inputs may cause them to take much longer
the fundamental definition of a tautology is in the context of propositional logic
the definition can be extended however to sentences in first order logic
these sentences may contain quantifiers unlike sentences of propositional logic
in the context of first order logic a distinction is maintained between logical validities sentences that are true in every model and tautologies or tautological validities which are a proper subset of the first order logical validities
in the context of propositional logic these two terms coincide
a tautology in first order logic is a sentence that can be obtained by taking a tautology of propositional logic and uniformly replacing each propositional variable by a first order formula one formula per propositional variable
for example because
displaystyle a lor lnot a
is a tautology of propositional logic
displaystyle forall x x x lor lnot forall x x x
is a tautology in first order logic
similarly in a first order language with a unary relation symbols r s t the following sentence is a tautology
displaystyle exists xrx land lnot exists xsx to forall xtx leftrightarrow exists xrx to lnot exists xsx to forall xtx
it is obtained by replacing
displaystyle a
displaystyle exists xrx
displaystyle b
displaystyle lnot exists xsx
displaystyle c
displaystyle forall xtx
in the propositional tautology
displaystyle a land b to c leftrightarrow a to b to c
not all logical validities are tautologies in first order logic
for example the sentence
displaystyle forall xrx to lnot exists x lnot rx
is true in any first order interpretation but it corresponds to the propositional sentence
displaystyle a to b
which is not a tautology of propositional logic
