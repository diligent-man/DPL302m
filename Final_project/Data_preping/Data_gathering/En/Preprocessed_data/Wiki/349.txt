mathematical logic tautology greek formula assertion true every possible interpretation
similarly either ball green ball green always true regardless colour ball
philosopher ludwig wittgenstein first applied term redundancy propositional logic borrowing rhetoric tautology repetitive statement
logic formula satisfiable true least one interpretation thus tautology formula whose negation unsatisfiable
formula made either true false based value assigned propositional variables
falsum representing arbitrary contradiction symbolism tautology may substituted truth value true symbolized instance by
tautology key concept propositional logic tautology defined propositional formula true possible boolean valuation propositional variables
key property tautology propositional logic effective method exists testing whether given formula always satisfied equiv whether negation unsatisfiable
definition tautology extended sentence predicate logic may contain quantifiersa feature absent sentence propositional logic
indeed propositional logic distinction tautology logically valid formula
context predicate logic many author define tautology sentence obtained taking tautology propositional logic uniformly replacing propositional variable first-order formula one formula per propositional variable
set formula proper subset set logically valid sentence predicate logic ie sentence true every model
word tautology wa used ancient greek describe statement wa asserted true merely virtue saying thing twice pejorative meaning still used rhetorical tautologies
word gained new meaning logic currently used mathematical logic denote certain type propositional formula without pejorative connotation originally possessed
analytic proposition refers analytic truth statement natural language true solely term involved
gottlob frege proposed grundlagen truth analytic exactly derived using logic
however maintained distinction analytic truth ie truth based meaning term tautology ie statement devoid content
tractatus logico-philosophicus ludwig wittgenstein proposed statement deduced logical deduction tautological empty meaning well analytic truths
henri poincar made similar remark science hypothesis in
although bertrand russell first argued remark wittgenstein poincar claiming mathematical truth non-tautologous synthetic later spoke favor in
logical proposition refers proposition provable using law logic
formalization semantics propositional logic term truth assignment wa developed
term tautology began applied propositional formula true regardless truth falsity propositional variables
lewis langford used term proposition formal logic universally valid

valuation function assigns propositional variable either truth f falsity

formula propositional logic tautology formula always true regardless valuation used propositional variables
valuation formula must definition assign one truth value true false assign

not-a implies b negation not-b not-a must false must true principle known reductio ad absurdum
displaystyle lnot aland bleftrightarrow lnot alor lnot b

problem determining whether formula tautology fundamental propositional logic
therefore task determining whether formula tautology finite mechanical one one need evaluate truth value formula possible valuations
one algorithmic method verifying every valuation make formula true make truth table includes every possible valuation
possible valuation propositional variable b c represented first three column following table
remaining column show truth subformulas formula culminating column showing truth value original formula valuation
row final column show sentence question verified tautology
also possible define deductive system ie proof system propositional logic simpler variant deductive system employed first-order logic see kleene sec one system
proof tautology appropriate deduction system may much shorter complete truth table formula n propositional variable requires truth table line quickly becomes infeasible n increases
proof system also required study intuitionistic propositional logic method truth table cannot employed law excluded middle assumed
formula r said tautologically imply formula every valuation cause r true also cause true
general procedure substitution rule allows additional tautology constructed given tautology kleene sec
suppose tautology propositional variable fixed sentence sa chosen
sentence obtained replacing variable corresponding sentence sa also tautology

method verifying tautology effective procedure mean given unlimited computational resource always used mechanistically determine whether sentence tautology

current research focus finding algorithm perform well special class formula terminate quickly average even though input may cause take much longer
sentence may contain quantifier unlike sentence propositional logic
