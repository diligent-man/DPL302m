The Georgian scripts are the three writing systems used to write the Georgian language Asomtavruli Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli
Although the systems differ in appearance their letters share the same names and alphabetical order and are written horizontally from left to right
Of the three scripts Mkhedruli once the civilian royal script of the Kingdom of Georgia and mostly used for the royal charters is now the standard script for modern Georgian and its related Kartvelian languages whereas Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are used only by the Georgian Orthodox Church in ceremonial religious texts and iconography
Georgian scripts are unique in their appearance and their exact origin has never been established however in strictly structural terms their alphabetical order largely corresponds to the Greek alphabet with the exception of letters denoting uniquely Georgian sounds which are grouped at the end
Originally consisting of letters Georgian is presently written in a -letter alphabet as five letters are obsolete
The number of Georgian letters used in other Kartvelian languages varies
Mingrelian uses thirty-three that are current Georgian letters one obsolete Georgian letter and two additional letters specific to Mingrelian and Svan
Laz uses the same current Georgian letters as Mingrelian plus that same obsolete letter and a letter borrowed from Greek for a total of
The fourth Kartvelian language Svan is not commonly written but when it is it uses Georgian letters as utilized in Mingrelian with an additional obsolete Georgian letter and sometimes supplemented by diacritics for its many vowels
The living culture of three writing systems of the Georgian alphabet was granted the national status of intangible cultural heritage in Georgia in and inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in
The origin of the Georgian script is poorly known and no full agreement exists among Georgian and foreign scholars as to its date of creation who designed the script and the main influences on that process
The first attested version of the script is Asomtavruli which dates back to the th century the other scripts were formed in the following centuries
Most scholars link the creation of the Georgian script to the process of Christianization of Iberia not to be confused with the Iberian Peninsula a core Georgian kingdom of Kartli
The alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of Iberia under King Mirian III or and the Bir el Qutt inscriptions of contemporaneously with the Armenian alphabet
It was first used for translation of the Bible and other Christian literature into Georgian by monks in Georgia and Palestine
Professor Levan Chilashvili's dating of fragmented Asomtavruli inscriptions discovered by him at the ruined town of Nekresi in Georgia's easternmost province of Kakheti in the s to the st or nd century has not been accepted
A Georgian tradition first attested in the medieval chronicle Lives of the Kings of Kartli ca
assigns a much earlier pre-Christian origin to the Georgian alphabet and names King Pharnavaz I rd century BC as its inventor
This account is now considered legendary and is rejected by scholarly consensus as no archaeological confirmation has been found
Rapp considers the tradition to be an attempt by the Georgian Church to rebut the earlier tradition that the alphabet was invented by the Armenian scholar Mesrop Mashtots and is a Georgian application of an Iranian model in which primordial kings are credited with the creation of basic social institutions
Georgian linguist Tamaz Gamkrelidze offers an alternative interpretation of the tradition in the pre-Christian use of foreign scripts alloglottography in the Aramaic alphabet to write down Georgian texts
Another point of contention among scholars is the role played by Armenian clerics in that process
According to medieval Armenian sources and a number of scholars Mesrop Mashtots generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet also created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets
This tradition originates in the works of Koryun a fifth-century historian and biographer of Mashtots and has been quoted by Donald Rayfield and James R
Russell but has been rejected by Georgian scholarship and some Western scholars who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation
In his study on the history of the invention of the Armenian alphabet and the life of Mashtots the Armenian linguist Hrachia Acharian strongly defended Koryun as a reliable source and rejected criticisms of his accounts on the invention of the Georgian script by Mashtots
Acharian dated the invention to four years after Mashtots created the Armenian alphabet he dated the latter event to
Some Western scholars quote Koryun's claims without taking a stance on its validity or concede that Armenian clerics if not Mashtots himself must have played a role in the creation of the Georgian script
Another controversy regards the main influences at play in the Georgian alphabet as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the Greek alphabet or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic
Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems most notably the order and numeric value of letters
Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters
Asomtavruli Georgian ასომთავრული Georgian pronunciation ɑsɔmtʰɑvruli is the oldest Georgian script
The name Asomtavruli means capital letters from aso ასო letter and mtavari მთავარი principalhead
It is also known as Mrgvlovani Georgian მრგვლოვანი rounded from mrgvali მრგვალი round so named because of its round letter shapes
Despite its name this capital script is unicameral
The oldest Asomtavruli inscriptions found so far date from the th century and are Bir el Qutt and the Bolnisi inscriptions
From the th century Nuskhuri script started becoming dominant and the role of Asomtavruli was reduced
However epigraphic monuments of the th to th centuries continued to be written in Asomtavruli script
Asomtavruli in this later period became more decorative
In the majority of th-century Georgian manuscripts which were written in Nuskhuri script Asomtavruli was used for titles and the first letters of chapters
However some manuscripts written completely in Asomtavruli can be found until the th century
In early Asomtavruli the letters are of equal height
Georgian historian and philologist Pavle Ingorokva believes that the direction of Asomtavruli like that of Greek was initially boustrophedon though the direction of the earliest surviving texts is from left to the right
In most Asomtavruli letters straight lines are horizontal or vertical and meet at right angles
The only letter with acute angles is Ⴟ ჯ jani
There have been various attempts to explain this exception
Georgian linguist and art historian Helen Machavariani believes jani derives from a monogram of Christ composed of the Ⴈ ი ini and Ⴕ ქ kani
According to Georgian scholar Ramaz Pataridze the cross-like shape of letter jani indicates the end of the alphabet and has the same function as the similarly shaped Phoenician letter taw Greek chi Χ and Latin X though these letters do not have that function in Phoenician Greek or Latin
From the th century the forms of some letters began to change
The equal height of the letters was abandoned with letters acquiring ascenders and descenders
In Nuskhuri manuscripts Asomtavruli are used for titles and illuminated capitals
The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text
In the early stages of the development of Nuskhuri texts Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink
Later from the th century the letters were illuminated
The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text
For example in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era when the styles of the Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals
From the th-century limb-flowery limb-arrowy and limb-spotty decorative forms of Asomtavruli are developed
The first two are found in th- and th-century monuments whereas the third one is used until the th century
Importance was attached also to the colour of the ink itself
Asomtavruli letter დ doni is often written with decoration effects of fish and birds
The Curly decorative form of Asomtavruli is also used where the letters are wattled or intermingled on each other or the smaller letters are written inside other letters
It was mostly used for the headlines of the manuscripts or the books although there are complete inscriptions which were written in the Asomtavruli Curly form only
The following table shows the stroke order and direction of each Asomtavruli letter
Nuskhuri Georgian ნუსხური Georgian pronunciation nusxuri is the second Georgian script
The name nuskhuri comes from nuskha ნუსხა meaning inventory or schedule
Nuskhuri was soon augmented with Asomtavruli illuminated capitals in religious manuscripts
The combination is called Khutsuri Georgian ხუცური clerical from khutsesi ხუცესი cleric and it was principally used in hagiography
Nuskhuri first appeared in the th century as a graphic variant of Asomtavruli
The oldest inscription is found in the Ateni Sioni Church and dates to AD
The oldest surviving Nuskhuri manuscripts date to AD
Nuskhuri becomes dominant over Asomtavruli from the th century
Nuskhuri letters vary in height with ascenders and descenders and are slanted to the right
Letters have an angular shape with a noticeable tendency to simplify the shapes they had in Asomtavruli
Note Without proper font support you may see question marks boxes or other symbols instead of Nuskhuri lettersThe following table shows the stroke order and direction of each Nuskhuri letter
Asomtavruli is used intensively in iconography murals and exterior design especially in stone engravings
Georgian linguist Akaki Shanidze made an attempt in the s to introduce Asomtavruli into the Mkhedruli script as capital letters to begin sentences as in the Latin script but it did not catch on
Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are officially used by the Georgian Orthodox Church alongside Mkhedruli
Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia called on people to use all three Georgian scripts
Mkhedruli Georgian მხედრული Georgian pronunciation mxɛdruli is the third and current Georgian script
Mkhedruli literally meaning cavalry or military derives from mkhedari მხედარი meaning horseman knight warrior and cavalier
Mkhedruli is bicameral with capital letters that are called Mkhedruli Mtavruli მხედრული მთავრული or simply Mtavruli მთავრული Georgian pronunciation mtʰɑvruli
Nowadays Mtavruli is typically used in all-caps text in titles or to emphasize a word though in the late th and early th centuries it was occasionally used as in Latin and Cyrillic scripts to capitalize proper nouns or the first word of a sentence
Mkhedruli first appears in the th century
The oldest Mkhedruli inscription is found in Ateni Sioni Church dating back to AD
The second oldest Mkhedruli-written text is found in the th-century royal charters of King Bagrat IV of Georgia
Mkhedruli was mostly used then in the Kingdom of Georgia for the royal charters historical documents manuscripts and inscriptions
Mkhedruli was used for non-religious purposes only and represented the civil royal and secular script
Mkhedruli became more and more dominant over the two other scripts though Khutsuri Nuskhuri with Asomtavruli was used until the th century
Mkhedruli became the universal writing Georgian system outside of the Church in the th century with the establishment and development of printed Georgian fonts
Mkhedruli inscriptions of the th and th centuries are characterized in rounding of angular shapes of Nuskhuri letters and making the complete outlines in all of its letters
Mkhedruli letters are written in the four-linear system similar to Nuskhuri
Mkhedruli becomes more round and free in writing
It breaks the strict frame of the previous two alphabets Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri
Mkhedruli letters begin to get coupled and more free calligraphy develops
The modern Georgian alphabet consists of letters
The Society for the Spreading of Literacy among Georgians founded by Prince Ilia Chavchavadze in discarded five letters from the Georgian alphabet that had become redundant
ჱ he eɪ Svan eː sometimes called ei or e-merve eighth e was equivalent to ეჲ ey as in ქრისტჱ ქრისტეჲ krist'ey 'Christ'
ჲ hie je also called yota appeared instead of ი ini after a vowel but came to have the same pronunciation as ი ini and was replaced by it
Thus ქრისტჱ ქრისტეჲ krist'ey Christ is now written ქრისტე krist'e
ჳ vie uɪ Svan w came to be pronounced the same as ვი vi and was replaced by that sequence as in სხჳსი სხვისი skhvisi others'
ჴ qari hari q⁽ʰ⁾ came to be pronounced the same as ხ khani and was replaced by it
ჵ hoe oː was used for the interjection hoi and is now spelled ჰოი
Also used in Bats for the ʕ or ɦ soundAll but ჵ hoe continue to be used in the Svan alphabet ჲ hie is used in the Mingrelian and Laz alphabets as well for the y-sound j
Several others were used for Abkhaz and Ossetian in the short time they were written in Mkhedruli script
Mkhedruli has been adapted to languages besides Georgian
Some of these alphabets retained letters obsolete in Georgian while others required additional letters
ჶ fi phi is used in Laz and Svan and formerly in Ossetian and Abkhazian
It derives from the Greek letter Φ phi
ჷ shva schwa also called yn is used for the schwa sound in Svan and Mingrelian and formerly in Ossetian and Abkhazian
ჸ elifi alif is used in for the glottal stop in Svan and Mingrelian
ჹ turned gani was once used for ɢ in evangelical literature in Dagestanian languages
ჼ modifier nar is used in Bats
ჺ aini ain is occasionally used for ʕ in Bats
It derives from the Arabic letter ⟨ﻋ⟩ ‘ain
ჽ aen was used in the Ossetian language when it was written in the Georgian script
ჾ hard sign was used in Abkhaz for velarization of the preceding consonant
ჿ labial sign was used in Abkhaz for labialization of the preceding consonantThe following table shows the stroke order and direction of each Mkhedruli letter
ზ ო and ხ zeni oni khani are almost always written without the small tick at the end while the handwritten form of ჯ jani often uses a vertical line sometimes with a taller ascender or with a diagonal cross bar even when it is written at a diagonal the cross-bar is generally shorter than in print
Only four letters are x-height with neither ascenders nor descenders ა თ ი ო
Thirteen have ascenders like b or d in English ბ ზ მ ნ პ რ ს შ ჩ ძ წ ხ ჰ
An equal number have descenders like p or q in English გ დ ე ვ კ ლ ჟ ტ უ ფ ღ ყ ც
Three letters have both ascenders and descenders like þ in Old English ქ ჭ and in handwriting ჯ
წ has both ascender and descender in print and sometimes in handwritingThere is individual and stylistic variation in many of the letters
For example the top circle of ზ zeni and the top stroke of რ rae may go in the other direction than shown in the chart that is counter-clockwise starting at o'clock and upwards see the external-link section for videos of people writing
გ gani may be written like ვ vini with a closed loop at the bottom
დ doni is frequently written with a simple loop at top
კ ც and ძ k'ani tsani dzili are generally written with straight vertical lines at the top so that for example ც tsani resembles a U with a dimple in the right side
ლ lasi is frequently written with a single arc
Even when all three are written they're generally not all the same size as they are in print but rather riding on one wide arc like two dimples in it
Rarely ო oni is written as a right angle
რ rae is frequently written with one arc like a Latin ⟨h⟩
ტ t'ari often has a small circle with a tail hanging into the bowl rather than two small circles as in print or as an O with a straight vertical line intersecting the top
It may also be rotated a bit clockwise with the small circles further to the right and not as close to the top
წ ts'ili is generally written with a round bowl at the bottom
ჭ ch'ari may be written without the hook at the top and often with a completely straight vertical line
ჱ he may be written without the loop like a conflation of ს and ჰ
ჯ jani is sometimes written so that it looks like a hooked version of the Latin XSeveral letters are similar and may be confused at first especially in handwriting
For ვ vini and კ k'ani the critical difference is whether the top is a full arc or a more-or-less vertical line
For ვ vini and გ gani it is whether the bottom is an open curve or closed a loop
The same is true of უ uni and შ shini in handwriting the tops may look the same
For კ k'ani and პ p'ari the crucial difference is whether the letter is written below or above x-height and whether it's written top-down or bottom-up
ძ dzili is written with a vertical topAsomtavruli is often highly stylized and writers readily formed ligatures intertwined letters and placed letters within letters or other such monograms
Nuskhuri like Asomtavruli is also often highly stylized
Writers readily formed ligatures and abbreviations for nomina sacra including diacritics called karagma which resemble titla
Because writing materials such as vellum were scarce and therefore precious abbreviating was a practical measure widespread in manuscripts and hagiography by the th century
Mkhedruli in the th to th centuries also came to employ digraphs to the point that they were obligatory requiring adherence to a complex system
Georgian scripts come in only a single typeface though word processors can apply automatic fake oblique and bold formatting to Georgian text
Traditionally Asomtavruli was used for chapter or section titles where Latin script might use bold or italic type
In Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri punctuation various combinations of dots were used as word dividers and to separate phrases clauses and paragraphs
In monumental inscriptions and manuscripts of th to th centuries these were written as dashes like − = and =−
In the th century clusters of one · two three ჻ and six ჻჻ dots later sometimes small circles were introduced by Ephrem Mtsire to indicate increasing breaks in the text
One dot indicated a minor stop presumably a simple word break two dots marked or separated special words three dots for a bigger stop such as the appositive name and title the sovereign Alexander below or the title of the Gospel of Matthew above and six dots were to indicate the end of the sentence
Starting in the th century marks resembling the apostrophe and comma came into use
An apostrophe was used to mark an interrogative word and a comma appeared at the end of an interrogative sentence
From the th century on these were replaced with the semicolon the Greek question mark
In the th century Patriarch Anton I of Georgia reformed the system again with commas single dots and double dots used to mark complete incomplete and final sentences respectively
For the most part Georgian today uses the punctuation as in international usage of the Latin script
This table lists the three scripts in parallel columns including the letters that are now obsolete in all alphabets shown with a blue background obsolete in Georgian but still used in other alphabets green background or additional letters in languages other than Georgian pink background

The Georgian script was used for writing North Caucasian and Dagestani languages in connection with Georgian missionary activities in the areas starting in the th centuryThe first Georgian script was included in Unicode Standard in October with the release of version
In creating the Georgian Unicode block important roles were played by German Jost Gippert a linguist of Kartvelian studies and American-Irish linguist and script-encoder Michael Everson who created the Georgian Unicode for the Macintosh systems
Significant contributions were also made by Anton Dumbadze and Irakli Garibashvili not to be mistaken with the Prime Minister of Georgia Irakli Garibashvili
Georgian Mkhedruli script received an official status for being Georgia's internationalized domain name script for გე
Mtavruli letters were added in Unicode version in June
They are capital letters with similar letterforms to Mkhedruli but with descenders shifted above the baseline with a wider central oval and with the top slightly higher than the ascender height
Before this addition font creators included Mtavruli in various ways
Some fonts came in pairs of which one had lowercase letters and the other uppercase some Unicode fonts placed Mtavruli letterforms in the Asomtavruli range U+A-U+CF or in the Private Use Area and some ASCII-based ones mapped them to the ASCII capital letters
Georgian characters are found in three Unicode blocks
The first block U+AU+FF is simply called Georgian
Mkhedruli modern Georgian occupies the U+DU+FF range shown in the bottom half of the first table below and Asomtavruli occupies the U+AU+CF range shown in the top half of the same table
The second block is the Georgian Supplement U+DU+DF and it contains Nuskhuri
Mtavruli capitals are included in the Georgian Extended block U+CU+CBF
Mtavruli is defined as the upper case but not title case of Mkhedruli and Asomtavruli as the upper case and title case of Nuskhuri
Mac OS Georgian is an unofficial character encoding created by Michael Everson for Georgian on classic Mac OS
It is an extended ASCII encoding using the code points from x through xFF to represent the characters of the Asomtavruli and Mkhedruli scripts plus a number of widely-used symbols not included in -bit ASCII
