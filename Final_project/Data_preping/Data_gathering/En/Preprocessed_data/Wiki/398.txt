Datacommonsorg is an open knowledge repository hosted by Google that provides a unified view across multiple public datasets combining economic scientific and other open datasets into an integrated data graph The Datacommonsorg site was launched in May with an initial dataset consisting of fact checking data published in Schemaorg ClaimReview format by several fact checkers from the International Fact Checking Network Google has worked with partners including the United States Census the World Bank and US Bureau of Labor Statistics to populate the repository which also hosts data from Wikipedia the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation The service expanded during to include an RDF style Knowledge Graph populated from a number of largely statistical open datasets The service was announced to a wider audience in In the service improved its coverage of non US datasets while also increasing its coverage of bioinformatics and coronavirus
Datacommonsorg places more emphasis on statistical data than is common for Linked Data and knowledge graph initiatives It includes geographical demographic weather and real estate data alongside other categories describing states Congressional districts and cities in the United States as well as biological specimens power plants and elements of the human genome via the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ENCODE project It represents data as semantic triples each of which can have its own provenance It centers on the entity oriented integration of statistical observations from a variety of public datasets Although it supports a subset of the WC SPARQL query language its APIs also include tools — such as a Pandas dataframe interface — oriented towards data science statistics and data visualization
Datacommonsorg is integrative meaning that rather than providing a hosting platform for diverse datasets it attempts to consolidate much of the information the datasets provide into a single data graph
Datacommonsorg is built on a graph data model The graph can be accessed through a browser interface and several APIs and is expanded through loading data typically CSV and MCF based templates The graph can be accessed by natural language queries in Google Search The data vocabulary used to define the datacommonsorg graph is based upon Schemaorg In particular the Schemaorg terms StatisticalPopulation
and Observation were proposed to Schemaorg to support datacommons like usecases
