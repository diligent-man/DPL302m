shortly after his first election to the senate lieberman was approached by incoming majority leader george mitchell who advised him pick out two or three areas that you re really interested in and learn them so that your colleagues know what you re talking about you re going to have more influence even as a freshman than you think because you know there s hundreds of issues and inevitably we rely on each other recalling the conversation lieberman has said that was true when i first came in although you could see partisanship beginning to eat away at that
but at the end of my years it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to votes to break a filibuster to get things done

it was a very hard thing for me to do because i liked him but i really felt what he did was awful and that unless i felt myself if i didn t say something i d be a hypocrite
i also felt that if somebody who was supportive of him didn t say something it would not be good
and so it got a lot of attention
i got a call from erskine bowles who was chief of staff about three or four days later saying that he was going to express an opinion which wasn t universally held at the white house he thought i helped the president by bursting the boil that was the metaphor he used
the following sunday morning i m at home and the phone rings it s the white house
and it s now about a week and a couple of days since i made the speech
the president says it was the president i just want you to know that there s nothing you said in that speech that i don t agree with
