Kitab al-I'tibar Arabic كتاب الاعتبار The Book of Learning by Example is the autobiography of Usama ibn-Munqidh an Arab Syrian diplomat soldier of the th century hunter poet and nobleman
The book was first discovered in in the Real Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial San Lorenzo de El Escorial Madrid Spain
It exists as folios with the first pages missing and is considered a copy of a copy of the original made in July
However it remains the only version available to date
Hartwig Derenbourg - was the first to mention the manuscript in his three volumes book Les manuscrits arabes de l'Escurial - and his book Ousama ibn Mounkidh un mir syrien when he studied transcribed and published the work
Hitti added to his work in his publication An Arab-Syrian Gentlemen in the Period of the Crusades Memoirs of Usamah ibn-Munqidh with the latest edition published in by Columbia University Press
Usamah's autobiography is part of the literary genre known as adab which aims at pleasing diverting and titilating its readers as well as instructing them
Hitti in the introduction to his translation describes the work as superior to other Arabic biographies
According to him It gives us a glimpse into Syrian methods of warfare hawking and medication and ushers us into the intimacies of Moslem court life as well as private home life
It also offers an insight into the mindset of Arabic knights as they interacted with the crusaders as friends fought against them as enemies and on matters of religion and politics
Much of the autobiography addresses the material culture of the time
It describes wealthier society members including their houses clothes and valued possessions
There is much detail on military society as Usama was involved in many battles against Christians and fellow Muslims including attitudes towards the Christian crusaders
It provides an idea of the internal political structure as Usama served under the Fatimid court in Egypt and under Nur al-Din
Usama provides information on medical practices religion and hunting
When Usama moves to Egypt in the caliph provided him with a place to reside which he describes
The autobiography gives evidence of textiles and clothing He Al-Malik al-'Adil put at my disposal six thousand Egyptian dinars a camel load of Dabiqi clothes of ciclatoum of squirrel-furred gowns of Dimyati brocade and of turbans
Dabiqi cloth was linen sometimes interwoven with gold and silk ciclatoun was another precious cloth
Dimyati brocade was a white linen or silk with added gold threads
Usama describes the things that were plundered from his home when he had to flee from it From the hall of my home they carried away forty huge camel bags all sewn up and containing great quantities of silver gold and clothing and from my stable they marched away thirty-six horses and female saddle mules
Usama describes another time when his possessions were stolen when his family are returning from Egypt
On their journey the King of Jerusalem took all their valuable possessions jewellery which had been entrusted to the women clothes gems swords weapons and gold and silver amounting to about thirty thousand dinars
The most significant loss for Usama were his books
Books would be a very valuable item in the era before printing as they must be transcribed by hand by a scribe and only the wealthy would be able to afford them
Usama can cope with the loss of his other possessions but could never forget the loss of his books Their loss has left a heartsore that will stay with me to the last day of my life
In the militarized society of the time war spoils were highly valued
They demonstrated prestige as only the rich elite could afford them
For example Usama describes a quilted gold saddle he owned
He suggests that only someone of his status could afford such an item Read what is on it
Is it' Abbas ' name and his son's or is it my name And who else in the days of al-Hafiz could ride in Egypt on a gold saddle but I
After getting into trouble with his uncle who ruled Shayzar Usama was exiled traveling to Damascus Jerusalem Cairo Mosul and Mecca
Usama was in the army of the Atabeg Zengi went to the Fatimid court in Egypt and was in the army of Nur al-Din
The political structure of the area changed considerably during Usama's lifetime
The Islamic world was very fragmented and divided at the time between the Abbasid caliphate of Baghdad and the Fatimid caliphate based on Cairo
By the late th century neither caliph held any real power and autonomous rulers were establishing themselves
In reality the three great powers at the end of the th century were the Great Seljuk Sultanate the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and the Fatimid Caliphate which was ruled by a military wazirate
By the end of his life however Syria and Egypt were united under Saladin and had re-conquered most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from the crusaders
The Fatimite court was full of conspiracies and feuds
Usama shows how the power of the caliph was limited by the military rulers and how the instability of the government caused feuds and assassinations For example in the Fatimite caliph tried to kill his vizier
Al-Zafir the caliph now planned to put al-Adil his vizier to death
He concerted with a group of young men from his special bodyguard together with others whom he won over to the scheme by distributing money among them that they attack al-Adil in his home and put him to death
Another instance is when al-Adil is killed by Nasr ibn Abbas and Ibn Abbas' father Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh becomes the vizier
When al-Adil had gone to sleep that prefect notified Ibn Abbas who with six of his attendants made an assault upon him in the house in which he was sleeping and killed him
Also revealed is the corruption and bribery that went on
Usama gives the example of when the caliph tried to persuade Ibn Abbas to kill his father so that he would succeed to become vizier
The caliph bribes him to do this
He received twenty trays of silver holding twenty thousand dinars
After neglecting him for a few days the caliph sent him an assortment of clothing of all kinds
Ibn Abbas however tells his father about the plot and they decide to kill the Caliph
Nasr invited the caliph to come to his residence
after having installed a band of followers on one side of the house
As soon as the caliph was seated the band rushed upon him and killed him
The autobiography gives us details of Muslim attitudes towards the Christian crusaders who went to the Middle East
His views of the Franks can reveal the impression Muslims had at the time about the nature of their own society compared to the Franks' society for example when he describes the lack of jealousy in sexual affairs
Hitti points out that to a conservative Muslim this must have seemed shocking
Another example is his ridicule of the Frankish system of justice
He gives a couple of examples The first is a description of a duel to settle a dispute and the second is a man being dropped into a cask of water
If the man drowned he was innocent and if he floated he was guilty
This man did his best to sink when they dropped him into the water but he could not do it
So he had to submit to their sentence against him -may Allah's curse be upon them
This would have contrasted dramatically with the contemporary Muslim judicial procedure
Usama views Islamic society and learning as superior to that of the Franks
For example when a Frankish knight offers to take his son to his country to educate him in wisdom and chivalry he refuses
Thus there fell upon my ears words which would never come out of the head of a sensible man for even if my son were to be taken captive his captivity could not bring him a worse misfortune than carrying him into the lands of the Franks
He also criticises their medicine giving an example of an amputation which killed a patient however he follows this up with examples of some successful medical cures the Franks practiced
Usama describes the Franks as 'animals possessing the virtues of courage and fighting but nothing else'
Despite this however Usama became friends with one Frankish knight who he describes as a
Reverend knight who had just arrived from their land in order to make the holy pilgrimage and then return home
He was of my intimate fellowship and kept such constant company with me that he began to call me my brother
Between us were mutual bonds of amity and friendship
This attitude towards the Christians reflects Islamic society at the time
The Muslims were willing to co-operate with the Franks
Muslim rulers often made alliances with the Crusader states in their own internal struggles against fellow Muslims
There is a difference in the attitude to Franks who were new to the area and those who had been there for a long time
The Franks who have lived there a while have got used to the customs of Islamic society while the newcomers are more hostile
Everyone who is a fresh emigrant from the Frankish lands is ruder in character than those who have become acclimatized and have held long associations with the Muslims
Usama gives us details of medical practices by mentioning medical cures he has witnessed
For example someone who had lost his speech because of dust in his throat from sifting
He was given vinegar by a physician and cured
He drank it and took his seat for an instant after which he felt nauseated and began to vomit clay in abundance mixed with the vinegar that he had drunk
Consequently his throat became open again and his speech normal
Another example is when Usama is suffering from a cold he is given an Indian melon which cures him 'no sooner had I finished eating it than I began to perspire and the cold which I felt disappeared'
Arab doctors were also good at bone setting as well as stitching Usama describes one man whose face was struck with a sword which
Cut through his eyebrow eyelid cheek nose and upper lip making the whole side of his face hang down on his chest
his face was stitched and his cut was treated until he was healed and returned to his former condition
Usama is often quoted out of context to prove Arab medicine as superior to that of the Franks in his time
He gives an example of the difference between Thabit a Christian Arab physician sent by Usama's uncle with that of a Frankish physician
They brought before me a knight in whose leg an abscess had grown and a woman afflicted with imbecility To the knight I applied a small poultice until the abscess opened and became well and the woman I put on a diet and made her humour wet
In contrast the Frankish physician amputated the knight's leg causing him to die on the spot and to the woman he diagnosed that she had been possessed by a devil and made an incision in her skull which also killed the woman
However Usama also describes examples of successful Frankish medicine
He describes the treatment given to a knight by a Frankish physician
A horse kicked him in the leg which was subsequently infected and which opened in fourteen different places
Every time one of these cuts would close in one place another would open in another placeThen came to him a Frankish physician and removed from the leg all the ointments which were on it and began to wash it with very strong vinegar
By this treatment all the cuts were healed and the man became well again
He gives another example of a boy whose neck was affected with scrofula
A Frank noticed the boy and advised the boy's father on how to cure him
Take uncrushed leaves of glasswort burn them then soak the ashes in olive oil and sharp vinegar
Treat the scrofula with them until the spot on which it is growing is eaten up
Then take burnt lead soak it in ghee butter and treat him with it
The father treated the boy accordingly and the boy was cured
The sores closed and the boy returned to his normal condition of health
I have myself treated with this medicine many who were afflicted with such disease and the treatment was successful in removing the cause of the complaint
Usama is quoting his uncle who is quoting said Tabith on the example of fatal Frankish practices whereas he himself has positive experience with been taught and recommends Frankish medicinal practices
Also death following an amputation due to an abscess is the same treatment and fate suffered by the Ayyubid Sultan as-Salih Ayyub in miles from any Frankish physician
Usama gives us a record of how warfare was conducted
One of the main themes of the book is that the outcome of warfare is pre-determined 'Victory in warfare is from Allahand is not due to organisation and planning nor to the number of troops and supporters He describes how discipline was maintained while marching through enemy territory
making our stops at the call of the bugle and starting again at the call of the bugle
Siege warfare was much more common than open battles Usama describes the practice of mining digging a tunnel under a castle and then setting light to the wooden supports so the tunnel would collapse taking the tower of the castle with it
Usama also gives us information on the sort of armour and arms that were used
The lance was a very important weapon Usama describes using lances in the battle of Kafartab
We dislodged from them eighteen knights of whom some received lance blows and died others received lance blows and fell off their horses and died and still others received lance blows which fell on their horses and became footmen
The sword was also a high status weapon
Usama describes how his father's sword cut through his groom's outfit while it was still in its sheath
The sword cut through the outfit the silver sandal a mantle and a wooden shawl which the groom had on and then cut through the bone of his elbow
The sword was subsequently named after his father's groom
Usama devotes a section of his book to his hunting experiences
He describes the hunting practice of Zengi
The falconers would proceed ahead of us with the falcons which would be flown at the waterfowl
The drums would be beaten in accordance with the prevailing custom
The falcons would catch whatever birds they could
He also describes hunting partridges with his father
My father would draw near the sleeping partridge and throw at it a stick from his hand
The moment the Partridge was flushed he would throw off al- Yahshiir the falcon who would seize it
The falconer would then descend to it slay the bird
The falconer had to slay the bird himself as it was forbidden by the Qur'an to eat anything which is killed by a blow
Usama also describes a system of hunting using sakers
At first should be sent the leader which striking a gazelle binds on its ear
The auxiliary is sent after the leader and hits another gazelleThe leader now clutching the gazelle by its ear isolates it from the herd
Usama's autobiography can tell us a lot about various aspects of Islamic society during the th century
It can tell us about the material culture as well as the political and religious customs of the time
It reveals the fragmented and disunited nature of
the Muslim world and the internal divisions and rivalries
