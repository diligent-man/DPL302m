the dirty war spanish guerra sucia is the name used by the military junta or civic military dictatorship of argentina spanish dictadura c vico militar de argentina for the period of state terrorism in argentina from to as a part of operation condor during which military and security forces and right wing death squads in the form of the argentine anticommunist alliance aaa or triple a hunted down any political dissidents and anyone believed to be associated with socialism left wing peronism or the montoneros movement
it is estimated that between and people were killed or disappeared many of whom were impossible to formally report due to the nature of state terrorism
the primary target like in many other south american countries participating in operation condor were communist guerrillas and sympathisers but the target of operation condor also included students militants trade unionists writers journalists artists and any citizens suspected of being left wing activists including peronist guerrillas
the disappeared included those thought to be a political or ideological threat to the junta even vaguely or those seen as antithetical to the neoliberal economic policies dictated by operation condor
all were killed in an attempt by the junta to silence social and political opposition
by the s economic collapse public discontent and the disastrous handling of the falklands war resulted in the end of the junta and the restoration of democracy in argentina effectively ending the dirty war
many members of the junta are currently in prison for crimes against humanity and genocide
it left a profound impact on argentina culture as well which is still felt to this day
in the decades before the coup the argentinian military supported by the argentine establishment opposed juan per n s populist government and attempted a coup in before succeeding in with the revoluci n libertadora
after the fall of per n s government in argentina entered a long period of political instability
in per n returned from exile and president h ctor jos c mpora resigned allowing per n to take over as president
in per n died and his vice president his wife isabel per n became president
argentina entered a chaotic period of instability with daily kidnappings and assassinations by leftist terrorists and right wing factions
in the military junta overthrew the government of isabel per n
after taking control the armed forces proscribed peronism a decision that triggered the organization of peronist resistance in workplaces and trade unions as the working classes sought to protect the economic and social improvements obtained under per n s rule
soon after the coup peronist resistance began organizing in workplaces and trade unions as the working classes sought economic and social improvements
over time as democratic rule was partially restored but promises of legalizing the expression and political liberties for peronism were not respected guerrilla groups began to operate in the s namely uturuncos and the egp people s guerrilla army
both were small and quickly defeated
as per n returned from exile in the ezeiza massacre marked the end of the alliance between left and right wing factions of peronism
in per n withdrew his support for the montoneros shortly before his death
during the presidency of his widow isabel the far right paramilitary death squad argentine anticommunist alliance aaa or triple a emerged
in isabel signed a number of decrees empowering the military and the police to annihilate left wing activists
in her government was overthrown as a part of operation condor by a military coup led by general jorge rafael videla
the junta calling itself the national reorganization process organized and carried out strong repression of political dissidents or perceived as such through the government s military and security forces
they were responsible for the arrest torture killings and or forced disappearances of an estimated people
with the help of washington the junta was aided with million in military aid
another group on the far right that was responsible for the deaths of many was alianza anticomunista argentina otherwise known as triple a
triple a was led by jos l pez rega the minister of social welfare who used triple a as a death squad
both the junta and triple a targeted young professionals high school and college students and trade union members
these groups of people became main targets because of their involvement in political organizations that resisted the work of the right wing group
assassinations were carried out via mass shootings and the throwing of people from airplanes in the south atlantic
additionally prisoners many of whom had not been convicted through legal processes were detained in a network of secret concentration camps located throughout argentina
triple a partnered with the army navy and the air force to terrorize the population
military personnel such as navy captain adolfo scilingo who was tried for genocide counts of murder of causing injury of terrorism and of torture
these actions against victims called desaparecidos because they simply disappeared without explanation were confirmed via scilingo who has publicly confessed his participation in the dirty war stating that the argentinian military did worse things than the nazis
in the national commission on disappeared people forced scilingo to testify where he described how prisoners were drugged loaded onto military planes and thrown naked and semi conscious into the atlantic ocean
a vast majority of those who were killed disappeared without a trace and no record of their fate
the junta referred to their policy of suppressing opponents as the national reorganization process proceso de reorganizaci n nacional
argentine military and security forces also created paramilitary death squads operating behind fronts as supposedly independent units
argentina coordinated actions with other south american dictatorships during operation condor
faced with increasing public opposition and severe economic problems the military tried to regain popularity by occupying the disputed falkland islands
during the resulting falklands war the military government lost any remaining popularity after argentina s defeat by britain forcing it to step aside in disgrace and allow for free elections to be held in late
the democratic government of ra l alfons n was elected to office in
alfons n organized the national commission on the disappearance of persons comisi n nacional sobre la desaparici n de personas conadep to investigate crimes committed during the dirty war and heard testimony from hundreds of witnesses and began to build cases against offenders
the commission organized a tribunal to conduct a transparent prosecution of offenders holding the trial of the juntas in
among the nearly people prosecuted many of the leading officers were charged convicted and sentenced for their crimes
the argentinian armed forces opposed subjecting more of its personnel to the trials threatening the civilian leadership with another coup
in the military forced the passage of the ley de punto final full stop law in which put a line under previous actions and ended prosecutions for crimes committed by the national reorganization process
fearing military uprisings argentina s first two presidents sentenced only the two top dirty war former commanders
the punto final law stated that military personnel involved in torture were doing their jobs
in president carlos menem praised the military in their fight against subversion
in congress repealed the pardon laws and in the argentine supreme court ruled they were unconstitutional
under the presidency of nestor kirchner the argentine government re opened its investigations on crimes against humanity and genocide in and began the prosecution of military and security officers
the term dirty war was used by the military junta which claimed that a war albeit with different methods including the large scale application of torture and rape was necessary to maintain social order and eradicate political subversives
this explanation has been questioned in court by human rights ngos as it suggests that a civil war was going on and implies justification for the killings
during the trial of the juntas public prosecutor julio strassera suggested that the term dirty war was a euphemism to try to conceal gang activities as though they were legitimate military activities
although the junta said its objective was to eradicate guerrilla activity because of its threat to the state it conducted wide scale repression of the general population
it worked against all political opposition and those it considered on the left trade unionists half of the victims students intellectuals including journalists and writers rights activists and other civilians and their families
many others went into exile to survive and many remain in exile today despite the return of democracy in
during the trial of the juntas the prosecution established that the guerrillas were never strong enough to pose a real threat to the state and could not be considered a belligerent as in a war
the guerrilla had not taken control of any part of the national territory they had not obtained recognition of interior or anterior belligerency they were not massively supported by any foreign power and they lacked the population s support the program of extermination of dissidents was referred to as genocide by a court of law for the first time during the trial of miguel etchecolatz a former senior official of the buenos aires provincial police
crimes committed during this time genocide of civilian population and other crimes against humanity are not covered under the laws of war jus in bello which shields enlisted personnel from prosecution for acts committed under orders given by a superior officer or the state
estela de carlotto president of the argentine human rights non governmental organization grandmothers of the plaza de mayo states
that term is a way to minimize state terrorism and is a term born outside the country
it is a totally wrong concept there was no war dirty nor clean since former army officer juan per n was ousted from the presidency by a coup in revoluci n libertadora military hostility to peronism and populist politics dominated argentine politics
the aramburu decree prohibited the use of per n s name and when general lanusse who was part of the argentine revolution called for elections in he authorized the return of political parties
however per n who had been invited back from exile was barred from seeking office
in may peronist h ctor jos c mpora was elected as president but everyone understood that per n was the real power behind him
peronism has been difficult to define according to traditional political classifications and different periods must be distinguished
a populist and nationalist movement it has sometimes been accused of fascist tendencies
following nearly two decades of weak civilian governments economic decline and military interventionism per n returned from exile on june in as the country was becoming engulfed in financial social and political disorder
the months preceding his return were marked by important social movements as in the rest of south america and in particular of the southern cone before the military intervention of the s thus during h ctor c mpora s first months of government may july approximately social conflicts strikes and factory occupations had taken place
upon per n s arrival at buenos aires airport snipers opened fire on the crowds of left wing peronist sympathizers
known as the ezeiza massacre this event marked the split between left wing and right wing factions of peronism
per n was re elected in backed by a broad coalition that ranged from trade unionists in the center to fascists on the right including members of the neo fascist movimiento nacionalista tacuara and socialists like the montoneros on the left
following the ezeiza massacre and per n s denouncing of bearded immature idealists per n sided with the peronist right the trade unionist bureaucracy and radical civic union of ricardo balb n c mpora s unsuccessful rival at the may elections
some leftist peronist governors were deposed among them ricardo obreg n cano governor of c rdoba who was ousted by a police coup in february
according to historian servetto the peronist right
thus stimulated the intervention of security forces to resolve internal conflicts of peronism
on january the trotskyist people s revolutionary army attacked the military garrison in the buenos aires city of azul prompting a harsh response from the then constitutional president juan per n and contributing to his tendency to lean more and more on him
rightist faction of the justicialist movement during its last months of life
extreme right wing vigilante organizations linked to triple a or its kind of subsidiary c rdoba comando libertadores de am rica assassinated the union leader and ex peronist governor of c rdoba atilio l pez as well as leftist lawyers rodolfo ortega pe a and silvio frondizi brother of the ousted former argentine president arturo frondizi who had served as first president between may and march
also in the third world priest carlos mugica and dozens of political activists from left
juan per n died on july and was replaced by his vice president and third wife isabel per n who ruled argentina until she was overthrown in march by the military
the conadep human rights commission counted assassinations from to in its report nunca m s never again in in and in carried out by paramilitary groups who acted mostly under the jos l pez rega s triple a death squad according to argenpress at least trade unionists were assassinated in
however the repression of the social movements had already started before the attempt on yrigoyen s life on july the cgt section in salta was closed while the cgt smata and luz y fuerza in c rdoba were victims of armed attacks
agust n tosco secretary general of luz y fuerza successfully avoided arrest and went into hiding until his death on november
trade unionists were also targeted by the repression in as carlos bache was assassinated on august enrique damiano of the taxis trade union of c rdoba on october juan avila also of c rdoba the following day pablo fredes on october in buenos aires and adri n s nchez on november in the province of jujuy
assassinations of trade unions lawyers and so on continued and increased in and while the most combative trade unions were closed and their leaders arrested
in august isabel per n s government took away the rights of trade unionist representation of the federaci n gr fica bonaerense whose secretary general raimundo ongaro was arrested in october
during the same month of august the smata c rdoba trade union in conflict with the company ika renault was closed by the national direction of trade unions and the majority of its leaders and activists arrested
most of them were assassinated during the dictatorship
atilio l pez general secretary of the cgt of c rdoba and former vice governor of the province was assassinated in buenos aires on september
peronist guerrillas estimated at to active members montoneros in and at its peak in though almost half of them related to militia committed a number of attacks during this period such as bombings at the goodyear and firestone distributors riker and eli pharmaceutical laboratories xerox corporation and pepsi cola bottling companies

in enrique aroza garay of german owned borgward automobile factory and a chrysler executive were killed
in all servicemen and policemen were killed in left wing guerrilla incidents
in the guevarist people s revolutionary army erp inspired by che guevara s foco theory began a small rural insurgency in the province of tucum n with no more than men and women but were soon defeated by the argentine army
in february talo luder president of the national assembly who was acting as interim president instead of isabel per n who was ill for a short period signed the secret presidential decree which ordered the army to illegally neutralize and or annihilate the insurgency in tucum n the smallest province in argentina
operativo independencia granted power to the armed forces to execute all military operations necessary for the effects of neutralizing or annihilating the action of subversive elements acting in the province of tucum n
extreme right wing death squads used their hunt for far left guerrillas as a pretext to exterminate any and all ideological opponents on the left and as a cover for common crimes
in july there was a general strike
the government presided temporarily by talo luder from the peronist party issued three decrees and that created a defense council headed by the president and including his ministers and the chiefs of the armed forces
it was given the command of the national and provincial police and correctional facilities and its mission was to annihilate subversive elements throughout the country
isabel per n s government ordered a raid on march which involved military and police officers in villa constituci n santa fe in response to various trade unionist conflicts
many citizens and activists and trade unionists leaders were arrested while the uni n obrera metal rgica s subsidiary in villa constituci n was closed down with the agreement of the trade unions national direction headed by lorenzo miguel
repression affected trade unionists of large firms such as ford fiat renault mercedes benz peugeot and chrysler and was sometimes carried on with support from the firms executives and from the trade unionist bureaucracies
the sentence at the trials of the juntas stated the following the subversives had not taken control of any part of the national territory they had not obtained recognition of interior or anterior belligerency they were not massively supported by any foreign power and they lacked the population s support
however the supposed threat was used for the coup
in president isabel per n under pressure from the military establishment appointed jorge rafael videla commander in chief of the argentine army
as many people as necessary must die in argentina so that the country will again be secure declared videla in in support of the death squads
he was one of the military heads of the coup that overthrew isabel per n on march
in her place a military junta headed by general jorge rafael videla admiral emilio eduardo massera and general orlando agosti and was installed
the junta which dubbed itself national reorganization process systematized the repression in particular through the way of forced disappearances desaparecidos which made it very difficult as was the case in augusto pinochet s chile to file legal suits as the bodies were never found
this generalization of state terror tactics has been explained in part by the information received by the argentine military in the infamous school of americas and also by french instructors from the secret services who taught them counter insurgency tactics first experimented during the algerian war
by operation condor was at its height
chilean exiles in argentina were threatened again and had to seek refuge in a third country
chilean general carlos prats had already been assassinated by the chilean dina in buenos aires in with the help of former dina agents michael townley and enrique arancibia
cuban diplomats were also assassinated in buenos aires in the infamous automotores orletti torture center one of the clandestine prisons of the dictatorship managed by the grupo de tareas headed by an bal gordon previously convicted for armed robbery and who answered directly to the general commandant of the side otto paladino
automotores orletti was the main base of foreign intelligence services involved in operation condor
one of its survivors jos luis bertazzo who was detained for two months there identified chileans uruguayans paraguayans and bolivians among the prisoners
these captives were interrogated by agents from their own countries
according to john dinges s los a os del c ndor chilean mir prisoners in orletti center told jos luis bertazzo that they had seen two cuban diplomats jes s cejas arias and crescencio gala ega tortured by gordon s group and interrogated by a man who came from miami to interrogate them
the two cuban diplomats charged with the protection of the cuban ambassador to argentina emilio aragon s had been kidnapped on august by armed side agents who blocked off all sides of the street with their ford falcons the cars used by the security forces during the dictatorship
according to john dinges the fbi as well as the cia were informed of their abduction
in his book dinges published a cable sent by robert scherrer an fbi agent in buenos aires on september where he mentions in passing that michael townley later convicted of the assassination on september of former chilean minister orlando letelier in washington d c had also taken part to the interrogation of the two cubans
the former head of the dina confirmed to argentine federal judge mar a servini de cubr a on december in santiago de chile the presence of townley and cuban guillermo novo sampoll in the orletti center
the two men traveled from chile to argentina on august and cooperated in the torture and assassination of the two cuban diplomats
according to the terror archives discovered in paraguay in persons were murdered in the frame of condor disappeared desaparecidos and incarcerated
there were also some companies complicit in crimes against humanity
there has been participation of senior executives of ford mercedes benz acindar d lmine siderca ingenio ledesma and astarsa
victoria basualdo from columbia university investigated the complicity between large companies and armed forces
she found six companies in which dozens of union representatives were kidnapped and tortured often detained inside the companies and transferred to clandestine detention centers cdc in vehicles provided by the companies
in the case of d lmine siderca a cdc had been installed next to the factory connected through a door
in the case of acindar a detention and interrogation center staffed and operated by the federal police was already in existence in during the peronist government of maria estela martinez de peron
judge alicia vence was in charge of the investigation of acts of state terrorism committed in facilities and with the participation of authorities of the companies ford and mercedes benz
according to witnesses the center at mercedes benz was led by the racing driver juan manuel fangio
in an investigation was conducted to investigate these claims
jos alfredo mart nez de hoz president of the metallurgical company acindar who was minister of economy between and was criminally prosecuted in the case of the kidnapping of the businessmen federico and miguel gutheim owners of sadeco cotton company
there was also suspected participation from national media outlets such as clarin la naci n and la raz n the three most important argentine newspapers at the time
together they negotiated the buyout of papel prensa the largest national manufacturer of newsprint then owned by the widow of david graiver lidia papaleo and his family estate after his death in a plane crash on august
papaleo and the other private partners negotiated the sale of their shares on november
she along with graiver s brother and father were illegally detained by the buenos aires province police on march on suspected financial connections her late husband had with the guerrilla organization montoneros and sentenced to years imprisonment though an appeals court later cleared the defendants of all charges
according to papaleo the sale was made under duress
she had been receiving death threats and had been told by papel prensa s president pedro mart nez segovia who said was representing then minister of economy jos alfredo mart nez de hoz that she should sell her stake in the company
she along with her family attended a night meeting at the la naci n offices on november
there she testified that the representative of clar n hector magnetto presented her with a document which said sign or it will cost you your daughter s life and your own
in september a group of businessmen among whom were ernestina herrera de noble and hector magnetto from grupo clar n and bartolom luis mitre from la naci n along with members of the military junta inaugurated the papel prensa plant in san justo
in magnetto mitre and noble were declared innocent
federal judge juli n ercolini ruled that there was not enough evidence of any wrongdoing to accuse them
during a interview whose contents were revealed by declassified cia documents in former dina agent michael townley explained that ignacio novo sampol member of the coru anti castro organization had agreed to involve the cuban nationalist movement in the kidnapping in buenos aires of the president of a dutch bank
the abduction was organized by civilian side agents to obtain a ransom
townley said that novo sampol had provided from the cuban nationalist movement forwarded to the civilian side agents to pay for the preparation expenses of the kidnapping
after returning to the united states novo sampol sent townley a stock of paper used to print pamphlets in the name of grupo rojo red group an imaginary argentine marxist terrorist organization which was to claim credit for the abduction of the dutch banker
townley declared that the pamphlets were distributed in mendoza and c rdoba together with false flag bombings perpetrated by side agents
the aim was to establish the existence of the fake grupo rojo
however the side agents procrastinated too much and the kidnapping was never carried out
the exact chronology of the repression occurring before the operation condor s beginning in march is still debated but some sectors claim the long political conflict started in as individual cases of state sponsored terrorism against peronism and the left can be traced back to the bombing of plaza de mayo and revoluci n libertadora in
the trelew massacre of the actions of the argentine anticommunist alliance since and isabel mart nez de per n s annihilation decrees against left wing guerrillas during operativo independencia operation independence in have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the dirty war
the discontent with per n in started due to his drift to the right after having been a popular leftist leader for the first half of the th century
many of the groups that supported him throughout the s and s argued that peron was betraying the movement by aligning himself with industrialists foreign interests cia research paper insurgent success and failure selected case studies secret may the attacks by the left were met by ruthless action by the government and the argentina anticommunist alliance aaa a group known since the s for its violent and brutal stance towards leftist groups
targets of the junta were anyone believed to be associated with activist groups including trade union members and students
these included underage students like the ones tortured and murdered in the night of the pencils an operation directed by ram n camps general and head of the buenos aires provincial police from april to december
the rationale behind attacks against non combatants was the belief that anyone not sharing government ideology or supporting its actions was a threat it was believed that any party that has supported or continues to support the enemy shall be considered a party of the enemy proquest
other junta targets were people who uncovered evidence of government corruption and those thought to hold left wing views including french nuns l onie duquet and alice domon kidnapped by alfredo astiz
ram n camps told clar n in that he had used torture as an interrogation method and orchestrated forced disappearances
he had justified the appropriation of newborns from their imprisoned mothers because subversive parents will raise subversive children
the individuals who suddenly vanished are called los desaparecidos meaning the missing ones or disappeared
the people that disappeared throughout the s came from a variety of backgrounds not just suspected terrorists but also non combatants
according to a declassified document from the u s
department of state fifty five disappearances were occurring per month or approximately two per day
additionally people who sought to stay peaceful during the attacks were targeted by the government based on the belief that if left alone they would pose an even greater danger
this was despite the fact that percent of argentine torture victims had no knowledge of subversive activities
in december captured montoneros responsible for the death of general c ceres moni and the attack on the argentine army th mountain infantry regiment were tortured and executed during the massacre of margarita bel n in the military chaco province for which videla would be found guilty of homicide during the trial of the juntas in addition to the guilty verdicts against cristino nicolaides junta leader leopoldo galtieri and santa fe provincial police chief wenceslao ceniquel
the same year unknown persons were illegally executed by firing squad in c rdoba
victims relatives uncovered evidence that some children taken from their mothers soon after birth were being raised as the adopted children of military servicemembers as in the case of silvia quintela a member of the montoneros guerrillas movement
for three decades the mothers and grandmothers of the plaza de mayo a group founded in has demanded the return of these kidnapped children estimated to number as many as
in security forces violently arrested and threatened the members of this group made up predominantly of mothers who held weekly silent demonstrations in the capital s main square for over two years to demand justice for their disappeared children
that same year over bodies many without heads or hands were found on argentina s shorelines
department of state report next steps in argentina secret january
a declassified may u s
state department memorandum asserts that if there has been a net reduction in reports of torture this is not because torture has been forsworn but derives from fewer operations because the number of terrorists and subversives has diminished
the memorandum adds that disappearances include not only suspected terrorists but also encompass a broader range of people for example labor leaders workers clergymen human rights advocates scientists doctors and political party leaders
it also describes torture methods used to intimidate and extract information including electric shocks prolonged immersion in water cigarette burns sexual abuse rape removal of teeth and fingernails castration and burning with boiling water oil and acid
another declassified u s
state department memorandum stated that security forces simply murdered a couple in their own home without even taking them to a detention center showing the power the military had in and beyond
according to a human rights review previous argentina coups had imposed a strong military presence the military portraying its struggle as one seeking to preserve argentine values which justified their human rights violations
but none had been as violent and brutal as the coup
in late amnesty international accused the videla military government of being responsible for the disappearance of to argentine citizens since the coup
the registro unificado de v ctimas del terrorismo de estado ruvte unconvered records of people disappeared under the presidency of isabel per n and another disappeared during the military dictatorship
in adolfo p rez esquivel a catholic human rights activist who had organized the servicio de paz y justicia peace and justice service and suffered torture while held without trial for months in a buenos aires concentration camp was awarded the nobel peace prize for his efforts in defense of human rights
declassified documents of the chilean secret police cite an official estimate by the batall n de inteligencia of killed or disappeared between and mid
during this period at least disappeared were detained by pen poder ejecutivo nacional anglicized as national executive power and kept in clandestine detention camps throughout argentina before eventually being freed under diplomatic pressure
in the national commission on the disappearance of persons recorded the forced disappearance of persons from to although it noted that the actual number is higher
military junta members currently in prison for crimes against humanity refused to give argentine courts the lists of names and numbers of kidnapped tortured murdered or disappeared people so the exact number of victims remains uncertain
under the carlos menem government congress passed legislation to provide compensation to victims families
some argentine next of kin have applied to the relevant authorities and received up to us each as monetary compensation for the loss of loved ones during the military dictatorship while others such as the mothers of the plaza de mayo refused to take any money from a government they considered to follow the same neoliberal policies dictated by operation condor
after a ruling by the supreme court the national congress of argentina excluded convicts of crimes against humanity from the reduced sentences granted to other convicts
in an unclassified memorandum from the u s
department of state written in it was stated the cooperation efforts there were among argentina chile uruguay brazil etc
to fight against subversive groups
these efforts ranged from bilateral communications between these countries to capture and monitor these groups the fight against these terrorist exponents proposed to unify the greatest enemies of south america brazil and argentina given that they saw the threat of communism as more dangerous than each other
ara monthly report july the third world war and south america august an example of this alliance was the deportation of two montoneros that were to arrive from mexico in brazil for a meeting with the leftist group but before the two montoneros were intercepted in rio de janeiro by the argentine military with permission of the brazilian military intelligence
conversation with argentine intelligence source april
the cooperation between these countries was closely monitored by the united states government given that it has always had interests in maintaining hegemony over this part of the continent
the united states worried that these regimes threaten ed their increasing isolation from the west and the opening of deep ideological divisions among the countries of the hemispheres the national security archive even when the united states refused to call the conflict between these south american countries and the subversive groups a third world war according to the memorandum it was important for argentina brazil chile and uruguay egos salaries and their equipment budgets to believe in this third world war
additionally the u s
states its critical goal which is to get the political ideology out of human rights in order to avoid charges of intervention in any of these latin american countries
the interests of the united states in argentina during the cold war were rooted in different factors other than the threat of the spread of communism in south america as it may appear at first sight
although the subversive groups that were attacking the argentine government were leftist groups and some marxist groups the united states was much more interested in the nuclear power that argentina possessed
according to a u s
department of state memorandum argentina was part of the dirty dozen which was a list of countries that either had the capability of acquiring nuclear weapons but no motivation to do so or that had the motivation to acquire nuclear weapons but lacked the capability
in the document it is noted that the biggest security concerns for argentina were rivals brazil and chile given that these three countries wanted hegemony in latin america
in the same realm the argentine economy needed to stop depending on fossil fuels and had strong motivation to expand their nuclear program this could be one of the motivations behind the u s s lack of action against the human rights violations that were happening in argentina
in a declassified memorandum from the u s
department of state it is stated the importance to let president videla the adverse effect revelation of the assassination scheme will have on argentina efforts to obtain loans and otherwise come up with solutions for improving its economy
in this same document it is stated that argentina is the country which the united states should be able to exert the most leverage which demonstrates the american desire for hegemony in the region trying to exploit the weaknesses of the argentine dictatorship for its own benefit
the united states knew that it had to react to the human rights atrocities happening in argentine because if it did not then our singling out of uruguay paraguay and chile will appear highly politicized and will serve to fuel the critics who argue that us human rights policy is focused on countries where major us interests are not at stake
in professor melisa slatman published actividades extraterritoriales represivas de la armada argentina durante la ltima dictadura civil militar de seguridad nacional proquest in the facultad de humanidades y ciencias de la educaci n fahce of universidad nacional de la plata where she gives her perspective about the creation of operation condor
slatman argues that this operation was a product of a social construct where there was no empirical evidence other than the desire for repressive states to gain hegemony on the southern of the hemisphere whether that was by the united states and its perceived fight against communism or by the southern cone and their desire of control
she states that there is no way in which the people can truly know what happens during this operation given that the documents that have been released are merely a reflection of the voices and factors that played a part but it is only one side of the story
the use of these documents as the only sources that there are about operation condor fails to inform experts if it was truly an operation or if it was much more extensive than that more like a system
furthermore slatman argues that these documents present a biased point of view given that the majority of them come from american institutions that seek to present the information that established american hegemony and the unilateral relationships between the u s
and south american countries proquest
by the time of the coup on march the number of disappeared held under poder ejecutivo nacional pen stood at least
some disappeared in the form of pen detainees were imprisoned in argentina by the end of and it is estimated that some deaths occurred in the navy engineering school esma alone
these disappeared were held incommunicado and reportedly tortured
some like senator hipolito solari yrigoyen and socialist leader professor alfredo bravo were detenidos desaparecidos
by refusing to acknowledge the existence of what was later established to be at least concentration camps throughout the country they also denied the existence of their occupants
the total number of people who were detained for long periods was
among them was future president carlos menem who between and had been a political prisoner
some pen disappeared were eventually released under international pressure
of these were held in illegal detention centers for less than a year for one to three years for three to five years for five to seven years and for seven to nine years
of these were murdered after being released from detention
in one frank memo written in an official at the foreign ministry issued the following warning
our situation presents certain aspects which are without doubt difficult to defend if they are analyzed from the point of view of international law
these are the delays incurred before foreign consuls can visit detainees of foreign nationality contravening article of the convention of vienna the fact that those detained under executive power pen are denied the right to legal advice or defense the complete lack of information of persons detained under pen the fact that pen detainees are not processed for long periods of time the fact that there are no charges against detainees
the kidnapping and disappearance of people at the time when the conadep report was prepared the asociaci n abuelas de plaza de mayo grandmothers of the plaza de mayo or abuelas had records of children who disappeared together with their parents or were born at the numerous concentration camps and had not been returned to their families
the grandmothers of the plaza de mayo now believe up to grandchildren were stolen and are believed to have been located
on april the grandmothers received a tip off that the birth certificate of rosa roisinblit s infant grandson born in detention had been falsified and the child given to an air force civil agent and his wife
following the anonymous phone call he was located and agreed to a dna blood test confirming his true identity
rodolfo fernando grandson of roisinblit is the first known newborn of missing children returned to his family through the work of the grandmothers
on october roisinblit s daughter year old patricia julia roisinblit de perez who was active in the montoneros was kidnapped along with her husband year old jos mart nas p rez rojo
the case of maria eugenia sampallo born some time in also received considerable attention as sampallo sued the couple who adopted her illegally as a baby after her parents disappeared both montoneros
her grandmother spent years looking for her
the case was filed in after dna tests indicated that osvaldo rivas and maria cristina gomez were not her biological parents
along with army captain enrique berthier who furnished the couple with the baby they were sentenced respectively to and years in prison for kidnapping
the mothers of the plaza de mayo is the best known argentine human rights organization
for over thirty years the mothers have campaigned to find out about the fate of their lost relatives
the mothers first held their vigil at plaza de mayo in where they continue to gather there every thursday afternoon
an article of the madres of the plaza de mayo monthly publication caused quite a stir in the mid s when the human rights group familiares were quoted as saying familiares assumes the causes of their children s fight as their own vindicates all the disappeared as fighters of the people and when occurs the defeat of imperialism and the sovereignty of the people we will have achieved our objectives
in the mothers of the plaza de mayo split into two groups las madres de plaza de mayo linea fundadora founding line remains focused in recovering the remains of the missing and bringing former police and military commanders to justice
on the other hand the asociacion de madres de plaza de mayo mothers of the plaza de mayo association is opposed to the search for and identification of the missing and have also rejected monetary compensation
in april the former head of the mothers of plaza hebe de bonafini declared her admiration for her missing children jorge omar and ra l alfredo for taking up arms as left wing guerrillas
to this day white handkerchiefs are painted on the streets of argentina as a reminder of the terroristic actions of the military junta and grief felt by the mothers of the plaza de mayo
in the argentine military helped nazi war criminal klaus barbie stefano delle chiaie and major drug lords mount the bloody cocaine coup of luis garc a meza tejada in neighboring bolivia
they hired foreign agents for this task which was managed in particular by the st intelligence battalion headed by general guillermo su rez mason
after having been trained by the french military in the frame of operation charly the argentine armed forces would train their counterparts not only in nicaragua but also el salvador honduras and guatemala
from to after the falklands war the argentine armed forces exported counter insurgency tactics including the systemic use of torture death squads and disappearances
special force units such as batall n de inteligencia headed in by colonel jorge alberto muzzio trained the nicaraguan contras in the s in particular in lepaterique base
following the release of classified documents and an interview with duane clarridge former cia responsible for operations with the contras the clar n showed that with the election of president jimmy carter in the cia was blocked from engaging in the special warfare it had previously been engaged in
in conformity with the national security doctrine the argentine military supported u s
goals in latin america while they pressured the united states to be more active in counter revolutionary activities
in following the election of ronald reagan the cia took over training of the contras from batall n
many chilean and uruguayan exiles in argentina were murdered by argentine security forces including high profile figures such as general carlos prats in buenos aires in h ctor guti rrez ruiz and zelmar michelini in buenos aires in
others such as wilson ferreira aldunate escaped death
although at least six u s
citizens had been disappeared by the argentine military by high ranking state department officials including then secretary of state henry kissinger had secretly backed up argentina s new military rulers
during his years as u s
secretary of state kissinger had congratulated argentina s military junta for combating the left stating that in his opinion the government of argentina had done an outstanding job in wiping out terrorist forces
the importance of his role was not known about until the nation published in october an expos written by martin edwin andersen a washington post and newsweek special correspondent kissinger had secretly given the junta a green light for their state policies being the u s
army school of the americas soa founded in assigned the specific goal of teaching anti communist counterinsurgency training the place where several latin american dictators generations of their military where educated in state terrorism tactics including the uses of torture in its curriculum
in the institute was renamed to whinsec
according to a command and general foundation news issue the current curriculum at whinsec is compatible with curriculum taught at u s
military academies
whinsec faculty members travel to fort leavenworth in kansas throughout the year in order to remain up to date on curriculum changes
however the school remains controversial due to its influence over affairs in latin america and its education of latin american state actors on crimes against humanity within the military and law enforcement
in buenos aires robert c
hill a five time conservative republican ambassadorial appointee worked behind the scenes to keep the argentina military junta from engaging in massive human rights violations
upon finding out that kissinger had given the argentine generals a green light for the state terrorism of the junta in june while at an organization of american states meeting in santiago at the hotel carrera later made famous as the hotel cabrera in the film missing hill quietly scrambled to try to roll back the kissinger decision
hill did this although kissinger aides told him that if he continued kissinger would likely have him fired
during that meeting with argentine foreign minister c sar augusto guzzetti kissinger assured him that the united states was an ally
in october the nation noted hill was shaken he became very disturbed by the case of the son of a thirty year embassy employee a student who was arrested never to be seen again recalled former new york times reporter juan de onis
hill took a personal interest he went to the interior minister an army general with whom he had worked on drug cases saying hey what about this we re interested in this case he buttonholed foreign minister cesar guzzetti and finally president jorge r
videla himself
all he got was stonewalling he got nowhere de onis said
his last year was marked by increasing disillusionment and dismay and he backed his staff on human rights right to the hilt it sickened me said patricia derian the mississippi civil rights crusader who became president jimmy carter s state department point person on human rights after hill reported to her kissinger s real role that with an imperial wave of his hand an american could sentence people to death on the basis of a cheap whim
as time went on i saw kissinger s footprints in a lot of countries
it was the repression of a democratic ideal
in former secretary kissinger was feted by the dirty war generals as a much touted guest of honor at the world cup soccer matches held in argentina
in a letter to the nation editor victor navasky protesting publication of the article kissinger claimed at any rate the notion of hill as a passionate human rights advocate is news to all his former associates
ironically kissinger s posthumous lampooning of hill who had died in as human rights advocate was later shown to be false by none other than once and future kissinger aide henry shlaudeman later ambassador to buenos aires who told william e
knight an oral historian working for the association for diplomatic studies and training adst foreign affairs oral history project
state department documents obtained in during the george w
bush administration by the national security archive under the freedom of information act show that in october secretary of state henry kissinger and other high ranking u s
officials gave their full support to the argentine military junta and urged them to hurry up and finish their actions before the congress cut military aid
on october kissinger met with argentina s foreign minister and stated
the united states was also a key provider of economic and military assistance to the videla regime during the earliest and most intense phase of the repression
in early april the congress approved a request by the ford administration written and supported by henry kissinger to grant in security assistance to the junta
at the end of congress granted an additional in military aid and recommendations by the ford administration to increase military aid to the following year were also considered by congress
assistance training and military sales to the videla regime continued under the successive carter administration up until at least september when military aid was officially called to a stop within section b of the foreign assistance act
in and the united states sold more than in military spare parts to argentina and in the department of defense was granted to train argentine military officers
by the time the international military education and training imet program was suspended to argentina in total u s
training costs for argentine military personnel since totalled
the reagan administration whose first term began in asserted that the previous carter administration had weakened u s
diplomatic relationships with cold war allies in argentina and reversed the previous administration s official condemnation of the junta s human rights practices
the re establishment of diplomatic ties allowed for cia collaboration with the argentine intelligence service in training and arming the nicaraguan contras against the sandinista government
the intelligence battalion for example trained contras at lepaterique base in honduras
corporations such as ford motor company and citibank also collaborated with the junta in the repression and disappearance of workers active in unions
investigating french military influence in argentina french journalist marie monique robin found in the original document proving that a agreement between paris and buenos aires initiated a permanent french military mission in argentina and reported on it she found the document in the archives of the quai d orsay the french ministry of foreign affairs
the mission was formed of veterans who had fought in the algerian war and it was assigned to the offices of the chief of staff of the argentine armed forces
it was continued until date of the election of socialist fran ois mitterrand
after release of her documentary film escadrons de la mort l cole fran aise in which explored the french connection with south american nations robin said in an interview with l humanit newspaper french have systematized a military technique in urban environment which would be copied and pasted to latin american dictatorships
she noted that the french military had systematized the methods they used to suppress the insurgency during the battle of algiers and exported them to the war school in buenos aires
roger trinquier s famous book on counter insurgency had a very strong influence in south america
in addition robin said she was shocked to learn that the dst french intelligence agency gave dina the names of refugees who returned to chile operation retorno from france during their counterinsurgency
all of these chileans have been killed of course this puts in cause sic this makes responsible the french government and giscard d estaing then president of the republic
i was very shocked by the duplicity of the french diplomatic position which on one hand received with open arms the political refugees and on the other hand collaborated with the dictatorships
on september green members of parliament no l mam re martine billard and yves cochet filed a request to form a parliamentary commission to examine the role of france in the support of military regimes in latin america from to before the foreign affairs commission of the national assembly presided by edouard balladur ump
apart from le monde french newspapers did not report this request
ump deputy roland blum in charge of the commission refused to let marie monique robin testify on this topic
the commission in december published a page report claiming that the french had never signed a military agreement with argentina
when minister of foreign affairs dominique de villepin travelled to chile in february he claimed that no co operation between france and the military regimes had occurred
people in argentina were outraged when they saw the film which included three generals defending their actions during the dirty war
due to public pressure president n stor kirchner ordered the military to bring charges against the three for justifying the crimes of the dictatorship
they were albano hargindeguy reynaldo bignone and ram n genaro d az bessone
the next year robin published her book under the same title escadrons de la mort l cole fran aise death squads the french school revealing more material
she showed how val ry giscard d estaing s government secretly collaborated with videla s junta in argentina and with augusto pinochet s regime in chile
alcides lopez aufranc was among the first argentine officers to go in to paris to study for two years at the ecole de guerre military school two years before the cuban revolution and when no argentine guerrillas existed
in practice declared robin to p gina the arrival of the french in argentina led to a massive extension of intelligence services and of the use of torture as the primary weapon of the anti subversive war in the concept of modern warfare the annihilation decrees signed by isabel per n had been inspired by french texts
during the battle of algiers the police forces were put under the authority of the army
persons were disappeared
in algeria
reynaldo bignone named president of the argentine junta in july said in robin s film the march order of battle is a copy of the algerian battle
the same statements were made by generals albano harguindeguy videla s interior minister and diaz bessone former minister of planification and ideologue of the junta
the french military would transmit to their argentine counterparts the notion of an internal enemy and the use of torture death squads and quadrillages grids
marie monique robin also demonstrated that since the s there had been ties between the french far right and argentina in particular through the catholic fundamentalist organisation cit catholique created by jean ousset a former secretary of charles maurras the founder of the royalist action fran aise movement
la cit edited a review le verbe which influenced militaries during the algerian war notably by justifying the use of torture
at the end of the s the cit catholique founded groups in argentina and organised cells in the army
it greatly expanded during the government of general juan carlos ongan a in particular in
the key figure of the cit catholique in argentina was priest georges grasset who became videla s personal confessor
he had been the spiritual guide of the organisation arm e secr te oas the pro french algeria terrorist movement founded in franquist spain
robin believes that this catholic fundamentalist current in the argentine army contributed to the importance and length of the french argentine co operation
in buenos aires georges grasset maintained links with archbishop marcel lefebvre founder of society of st
pius x in who was excommunicated in
the society of pius x has four monasteries in argentina the largest one in la reja
a french priest from there said to marie monique robin to save the soul of a communist priest one must kill him luis roldan former secretary of cult under carlos menem president of argentina from to was presented by dominique lagneau the priest in charge of the monastery to robin as mr
cit catholique in argentina
bruno genta and juan carlos goyeneche represent this ideology
antonio caggiano archbishop of buenos aires from to wrote a prologue to jean ousset s spanish version of le marxisme l ninisme
caggiano said that marxism is the negation of christ and his church and referred to a marxist conspiracy to take over the world for which it was necessary to prepare for the decisive battle
together with president arturo frondizi radical civic union ucr caggiano inaugurated the first course on counter revolutionary warfare in the higher military college
frondizi was eventually overthrown for being tolerant of communism
by cadets at the navy mechanics school started receiving counter insurgency classes
they were shown the film the battle of algiers which showed the methods used by the french army in algeria
caggiano the military chaplain at the time introduced the film and added a religiously oriented commentary to it
on july four days after president arturo umberto illia was removed from office and replaced by the dictator juan carlos ongan a caggiano declared we are at a sort of dawn in which thanks to god we all sense that the country is again headed for greatness
