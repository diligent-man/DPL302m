Wood wrote his first play Prisoner and Escort in It was a play for television which was first performed on radio then on the stage and later on television Cockade won the Evening Standard Theatre Award for Most Promising New Writer in
Wood's work is known for its concern with British military life In his preface to Wood's Plays One director Richard Eyre commented There is no contemporary writer who has chronicled the experience of modern war with so much authority knowledge compassion wit and despair and there is no contemporary writer who has received so little of his deserved public acclaim Critics applauded his earliest plays such as Cockade for the details of military life and his use of military argot and vernacular He explored many aspects of contemporary military life Drill Pig was a black comedy about a young man who joins the army to escape his civilian life and his wife and her parents Don't Make Me Laugh exposed military and civilian attitudes through the home life of a sergeant his wife and their lodger Death Or Glory Boy was a semi autobiographical TV series about a grammar school boy joining the army
His work also covered warfare during many different periods of British military history Wood's plays have been described as pro soldier and anti war He was concerned with the experiences of fighting soldiers rather than patriotism or heroism Dingo was a black comedy attacking British myths and cliches about WWII Wood wrote the script for the film of The Charge Of The Light Brigade after John Osborne had been sued for plagiarising Cecil Woodham Smith's The Reason Why H Being Monologues at Front of Burning Cities was a historical pageant about Sir Henry Havelock's military campaign during the Indian Mutiny of Jingo was about the fall of Singapore and the symbolic end of British dominance in East Asia The television film Tumbledown directed by Richard Eyre was the story of Robert Lawrence MC written after many interviews with Robert Lawrence Lawrence later wrote his own version of his story called When the Fighting is Over Wood wrote an episode of Kavanagh QC Mute of Malice about an army chaplain traumatised by his experiences in Bosnia He adapted numerous novels about war into film and television scripts including How I Won the War from a novel by Patrick Ryan The Long Day's Dying from a novel by Alan White A Breed of Heroes from a novel by Alan Judd about a young British officer in Belfast and three episodes of Sharpe
Many of his works have a semi autobiographical element employing his personal and professional life as a writer working in theatre and movies Last Summer By The Seaside was a documentary cinema verite commentary about the English at play on the beach written and narrated by Charles Wood about his family on their annual holiday visit to his parents on the Isle of Wight Fill the Stage With Happy Hours was a comedy about a run down repertory theatre A Bit of a Holiday which starred George Cole as the writer Gordon Maple rewriting a historical screenplay in Rome was inspired by the filming of The Adventures of Gerard Veterans or Hair in the Gates of the Hellespont drew on the filming of The Charge of the Light Brigade with John Gielgud playing a character based on John Gielgud Has Washington Legs was written for America's bicentennial celebrations and was another comedy about film making A Bit Of An Adventure was about the life of writer Gordon Maple as played by George Cole Cole played George Maple again in two series of Wood's sitcom Don't Forget to Write and about the frustrations of a writer's life Across from the Garden of Allah was a comedy about an unsuccessful English screenwriter in Hollywood
While Wood remained active in the theatre a string of television dramas followed in the s The first of these was also perhaps the strangest The Emergence of Anthony Purdy Esq Farmer s Labourer was an experimental piece starring Freddie Jones and Judy Matheson about which little else is known bar that it was made by Harlech the ITV company for the South Wales and Western England region and was ITV s drama entry at the Monte Carlo TV festival It was not widely networked which is perhaps unsurprising in light of the comment by The Guardian s critic Nancy Banks Smith that it was completely incomprehensible to anyone east of Somerset
Because Wood lived in Bristol as his writing career was starting many of his early works were written about Bristol and also staged there At that time other rising playwrights such as Peter Nichols and Tom Stoppard lived there Meals On Wheels was an experimental satire about provincial conservatism and repression which was to have been performed at the Bristol Old Vic but interference from Bristol Council meant it was rejected Drums Along the Avon was a TV play about racial integration in Bristol which had to be broadcast with a disclaimer that it is a fantasy and we devoutly hope that no one in Bristol will see it otherwise Wood had submitted Dingo to the National Theatre Company but the Chamberlain's rejection of licence meant it could not be performed there so Bristol Arts Centre staged the play under club membership conditions to circumvent censorship
Wood had productive relationships with leading individuals in the British film and theatre industry He worked numerous times with Richard Lester Their first collaboration was on the film The Knack and How to Get It when the producer Oscar Lewenstein recommended Wood write the adaptation He worked again with Lester on the screenplay for Help and How I Won the War adapted from the Patrick Ryan novel and featuring some of the material from Wood s play Dingo His other screenplays for Richard Lester were The Bed Sitting Room from the Spike Milligan play and Cuba Inspired by stories by Yuri Krotkov Wood wrote for Lester a script about the catastrophes suffered by a Russian actor who bears an uncanny resemblance to Stalin but when financing fell through it was performed as Red Star by the Royal Shakespeare Company in Wood first worked with the director Richard Eyre when he directed the stage play Jingo Richard Eyre directed Wood s television film Tumbledown Wood cowrote with Eyre the scripts for Eyre s films Iris and The Other Man Wood wrote the screenplays for three films about composers directed by Tony Palmer Wagner Channel Puccini Channel and England My England Channel completing John Osborne's screenplay about Purcell after it had been abandoned owing to Osborne's terminal illness
Though Wood's plays are rarely revived his play Jingo was produced by Primavera at the Finborough Theatre in March directed by Tom Littler Jingo subtitled A Farce of War is set during the last days of British control of Singapore before the humiliating surrender to the Japanese Susannah Harker played Gwendoline and Anthony Howell her ex husband Ian
