the national hockey league was organized at the windsor hotel in montreal on november after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization the national hockey association nha which had been founded in in renfrew ontario
the nhl immediately took the nha s place as one of the leagues that contested for the stanley cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the nhl as the only league left competing for the stanley cup in

the nhl draws many highly skilled players from all over the world and currently has players from approximately countries
canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the league with an increasing percentage of american and european players in recent seasons
the national hockey league was established in as the successor to the national hockey association nha
founded in the nha began play in with seven teams in ontario and quebec and was one of the first major leagues in professional ice hockey
however by its eighth season a series of disputes with toronto blueshirts owner eddie livingstone led team owners of the montreal canadiens the montreal wanderers the ottawa senators and the quebec bulldogs to hold a meeting to discuss the league s future
realizing the nha constitution left them unable to force livingstone out the four teams voted instead to suspend the nha and on november formed the national hockey league
frank calder was chosen as the nhl s first president serving until his death in
the bulldogs were unable to play in the nhl and the remaining owners founded the toronto arenas to compete with the canadiens wanderers and senators
the first games were played on december
the montreal arena burned down in january causing the wanderers to cease operations and the nhl continued on as a three team league until the bulldogs returned in
the nhl replaced the nha as one of the leagues that competed for the stanley cup an interleague competition at the time
toronto won the first nhl title and then defeated the vancouver millionaires of the pacific coast hockey association pcha for the stanley cup
the canadiens won the league title in but the series in the stanley cup finals against the pcha s seattle metropolitans was abandoned due to the spanish flu epidemic
in montreal won their first stanley cup as a member of the nhl
the hamilton tigers won the regular season title in but refused to play in the championship series unless they were given a c bonus
the league refused and declared the canadiens the league champion after they defeated the toronto st
patricks formerly the arenas in the semi final
montreal was then defeated by the victoria cougars of the western canada hockey league wchl in
it was the last time a non nhl team won the trophy as the stanley cup became the de facto nhl championship in after the wchl ceased operation
the national hockey league embarked on a rapid expansion in the s adding the montreal maroons and the boston bruins in the latter being the first american team to join the league
the new york americans began play in after purchasing the assets of the hamilton tigers and were joined by the pittsburgh pirates
the new york rangers were added in and the chicago black hawks and detroit cougars later the red wings were added after the league purchased the assets of the defunct wchl
a group purchased the toronto st
patricks in and immediately renamed them the toronto maple leafs
in the first nhl all star game was held to benefit ace bailey whose career ended on a vicious hit by eddie shore
the second was held in in support of howie morenz s family when he died of a coronary embolism after breaking his leg during a game
the great depression and the onset of world war ii took a toll on the league
the pirates became the philadelphia quakers in then folded a year later
the senators likewise became the st
louis eagles in also lasting only a year
the maroons did not survive as they suspended operations in
the americans were suspended in due to a lack of available players and were never reactivated
for the season the nhl was reduced to six teams the boston bruins the chicago black hawks the detroit red wings the montreal canadiens the new york rangers and the toronto maple leafs a line up often referred to as the original six which would remain constant for the next years
in the league reached an agreement with the stanley cup trustees to take full control of the trophy allowing it to reject challenges from other leagues that wished to play for the cup
in maurice rocket richard became the first player to score goals doing so in a game season
richard later led the canadiens to five consecutive titles between and a record no team has matched
on march asian canadian larry kwong became the first non white player in the nhl and broke the league s colour barrier by playing for the new york rangers
on january willie o ree became the first black player in the league s history when he made his debut with the boston bruins
by the mid s the desire for a network television contract in the united states coupled with concerns that the western hockey league was planning to declare itself a major league and challenge for the stanley cup spurred the nhl to undertake its first expansion since the s
the league doubled in size to teams for the season adding the los angeles kings the minnesota north stars the philadelphia flyers the pittsburgh penguins the california seals and the st
louis blues
however canadian fans were outraged that all six teams were placed in the united states so the league responded by adding the vancouver canucks in along with the buffalo sabres both located on the canada united states border
two years later the emergence of the newly founded world hockey association wha led the league to add the new york islanders and the atlanta flames to keep the rival league out of those markets
in the washington capitals and the kansas city scouts were added bringing the league up to teams
the nhl fought the wha for players losing to the new league in its first season of including the chicago black hawks bobby hull who signed a ten year million contract with the winnipeg jets then the largest in hockey history
the league attempted to block the defections in court but a counter suit by the wha led to a philadelphia judge ruling the nhl s reserve clause to be illegal thus eliminating the elder league s monopoly over the players
seven years of battling for players and markets financially damaged both leagues leading to a merger agreement in that saw the wha cease operations while the nhl absorbed the winnipeg jets the edmonton oilers the hartford whalers and the quebec nordiques
the owners initially rejected this merger agreement by one vote but a massive boycott of molson brewery products by canadian fans resulted in the montreal canadiens which was owned by molson reversing its position along with the vancouver canucks
in a second vote the plan was approved
wayne gretzky played one season in the wha for the indianapolis racers eight games and the edmonton oilers games before the oilers joined the nhl for the season
gretzky went on to lead the oilers to win four stanley cup championships in and and set single season records for goals in assists in and points in as well as career records for goals assists and points
in he was traded to the los angeles kings in a deal that dramatically improved the league s popularity in the united states
by the turn of the century nine more teams were added to the nhl the san jose sharks the tampa bay lightning the ottawa senators the mighty ducks of anaheim the florida panthers the nashville predators the atlanta thrashers now the winnipeg jets and in the minnesota wild and the columbus blue jackets
on july the nhl confirmed that it had received applications from prospective ownership groups in quebec city and las vegas for possible expansion teams and on june nhl commissioner gary bettman announced the addition of a st franchise based in las vegas and later named the vegas golden knights into the nhl for the season
on december the league announced a nd franchise in seattle later named the seattle kraken who joined in the season
there have been four league wide work stoppages in nhl history all occurring after
the first was a strike by the national hockey league players association in april which lasted for ten days but was settled quickly with all affected games rescheduled
a lockout at the start of the season forced the league to reduce the schedule from games to with the teams playing only intra conference games during the reduced season
the resulting collective bargaining agreement cba was set for renegotiation in and extended to september
with no new agreement in hand when the contract expired league commissioner gary bettman announced a lockout of the players union and closed the league s head office for the season
the league vowed to install what it dubbed cost certainty for its teams but the players association countered that the move was little more than a euphemism for a salary cap which the union initially said it would not accept
the lockout shut down the league for days making it the longest in sports history as the nhl became the first professional sports league to lose an entire season
a new collective bargaining agreement was eventually ratified in july including a salary cap
the agreement had a term of six years with an option of extending the collective bargaining agreement for an additional year at the end of the term allowing the league to resume as of the season
on october the first post lockout season took to the ice with all teams
the nhl received record attendance in the season with an average of per game
however its television audience was slower to rebound due to american cable broadcaster espn s decision to drop its nhl coverage
the league s post lockout agreement with nbc gave the league a share of revenue from each game s advertising sales rather than the usual lump sum paid up front for game rights
the league s annual revenues were estimated at billion
on september the labour pact expired and the league again locked out the players
the owners proposed reducing the players share of hockey related revenues from percent to percent
all games were cancelled up to january along with the nhl winter classic and the nhl all star weekend
on january a tentative agreement was reached on a ten year deal
on january the league and the players association signed a memorandum of understanding on the new deal allowing teams to begin their training camps the next day with a shortened game season schedule that began on january
player safety has become a major issue in the nhl with concussions resulting from a hard hit to the head being the primary concern
recent studies have shown how the consequences of concussions can last beyond player retirement
this has significant effects on the league as elite players have suffered from the aftereffects of concussions such as sidney crosby being sidelined for approximately ten and a half months which adversely affects the league s marketability
in december brendan shanahan was hired to replace colin campbell and was given the role of senior vice president of player safety
shanahan began to hand out suspensions on high profile perpetrators responsible for dangerous hits such as raffi torres receiving games for his hit on marian hossa
to aid with removing high speed collisions on icing which had led to several potential career ending injuries such as hurricanes defenceman joni pitkanen the league mandated hybrid no touch icing for the nhl season
on november ten former nhl players gary leeman rick vaive brad aitken darren banks curt bennett richie dunn warren holmes bob manno blair stewart and morris titanic sued the league for negligence in protecting players from concussions
the suit came three months after the national football league agreed to pay former players us million due to a player safety lawsuit

due to nathan mackinnon choosing not to participate following a bruised ankle team usa s kendall coyne schofield competed in the fastest skater competition in his place becoming the first woman to officially compete in the nhl s all star festivities
the attention led the nhl to include a on women s game before the all star game

notes
the national hockey league s rules are one of the two standard sets of professional ice hockey rules in the world the other being the rules of the international ice hockey federation iihf as used in tournaments such as the olympics
the iihf derived from the canadian amateur ice hockey rules of the early th century while the nhl rules evolved directly from the first organized indoor ice hockey game in montreal in updated by subsequent leagues up to when the nhl adopted the existing nha set of rules
the nhl s rules are the basis for rules governing most professional and major junior ice hockey leagues in north america
the nhl hockey rink is by feet m m approximately the same length but much narrower than iihf standards
a trapezoidal area appears behind each goal net
the goaltender can play the puck only within the trapezoid or in front of the goal line if the goaltender plays the puck behind the goal line and outside the trapezoidal area a two minute minor penalty for delay of game is assessed
the rule is unofficially nicknamed the martin brodeur rule brodeur at the time was one of the best goaltenders at getting behind the net to handle the puck
since the season the league trimmed the goal frames by inches cm on each side and reduced the size of the goalies leg pads
the league has regularly modified its rules to counter perceived imperfections in the game
the penalty shot was adopted from the pacific coast hockey association to ensure players were not being blocked from opportunities to score
for the season the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside
first the league removed the offside pass or two line pass rule which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team s defending zone was completed on the offensive side of the centre line unless the puck crossed the line before the player
furthermore the league reinstated the tag up offside which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone
the changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid nineties and the increased prevalence of the neutral zone trap
since when a team is guilty of icing the puck they are not allowed to make a line change or skater substitution of any sort before the following face off except to replace an injured player or re install a pulled goaltender
since the league has used hybrid icing where a linesman stops play due to icing if a defending player other than the goaltender crosses the imaginary line that connects the two face off dots in their defensive zone before an attacking player is able to
this was done to counter a trend of player injury in races to the puck
in the nhl fighting leads to major penalties while iihf rules and most amateur rules call for the ejection of fighting players
usually a penalized team cannot replace a player that is penalized on the ice and is thus short handed for the duration of the penalty but if the penalties are coincidental for example when two players fight both teams remain at full strength
also unlike minor penalties major penalties must be served to their full completion regardless of number of goals scored during the power play
the league also imposes a conduct policy on its players
players are banned from gambling and criminal activities have led to the suspension of players
the league and the players association agreed to a stringent anti doping policy in the collective bargaining agreement
the policy provides for a twenty game suspension for a first positive test a sixty game suspension for a second positive test and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test
at the end of regulation time the team with the most goals wins the game
if a game is tied after regulation time overtime ensues
during the regular season overtime is a five minute three on three sudden death period in which whoever scores a goal first wins the game
if the game is still tied at the end of overtime the game enters a shootout
three players for each team in turn take a penalty shot
the team with the most goals during the three round shootout wins the game
if the game is still tied after the three shootout rounds the shootout continues but becomes sudden death
whichever team ultimately wins the shootout is awarded a goal in the game score and thus awarded two points in the standings
the losing team in overtime or shootout is awarded one point
shootout goals and saves are not tracked in hockey statistics shootout statistics are tracked separately
there are no shootouts during the playoffs
instead multiple sudden death minute five on five periods are played until one team scores
two games have reached six overtime periods but none have gone beyond six
during playoff overtime periods the only break is to clean the loose ice at the first stoppage after the period is halfway finished
the national hockey league season is divided into a preseason september and early october a regular season from early october through early to mid april and a postseason the stanley cup playoffs
teams usually hold a summer showcase for prospects in july and participate in prospect tournaments full games that do not feature any veterans in september
full training camps begin in mid to late september including a preseason consisting of six to eight exhibition games
split squad games in which parts of a team s regular season roster play separate games on the same day are occasionally played during the preseason
during the regular season clubs play each other in a predefined schedule
since in the regular season all teams play games games each of home and road playing games in their own geographic division four against five of their seven other divisional opponents plus three against two others games against the eight remaining non divisional intra conference opponents three games against every team in the other division of its conference and against every team in the other conference twice home and road
the league s regular season standings are based on a point system
two points are awarded for a win one point for losing in overtime or a shootout and zero points for a loss in regulation
at the end of the regular season the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion and the league s overall leader is awarded the presidents trophy
the stanley cup playoffs which go from april to the beginning of june are an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best of seven series in order to advance to the next round
the final remaining team is crowned the stanley cup champion
eight teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs the top three teams in each division plus the two conference teams with the next highest number of points
the two conference champions proceed to the stanley cup finals
in all rounds the higher ranked team is awarded home ice advantage with four of the seven games played at this team s home venue
in the stanley cup finals the team with the most points during the regular season has home ice advantage
the annual nhl entry draft consists of a seven round off season draft held in late june
early nhl drafts took place at the queen elizabeth currently fairmont hotel in montreal
amateur players from junior collegiate or european leagues are eligible to enter the entry draft
the selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season playoff results and a draft lottery
the teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round with the last place team having the best chance of winning the lottery
once the lottery determines the initial draft picks the order for the remaining non playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season
for those teams that did qualify for the playoffs the draft order is then determined by total regular season points for non division winners that are eliminated in the first two rounds of the playoffs then any division winners that failed to reach the conference finals
conference finalists receive the th and th picks depending on total points with the stanley cup runner up given the st pick and the stanley cup champions the final pick
the most prestigious team award is the stanley cup which is awarded to the league champion at the end of the stanley cup playoffs
the team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the presidents trophy
the montreal canadiens are the most successful franchise in the league
since the formation of the league in they have nhl championships three between and when the stanley cup was still contested in an interleague competition twenty two since after the stanley cup became the nhl s championship trophy
they also lead all teams with stanley cup championships one as an nha team twenty three as an nhl team
of the four major professional sports leagues in north america the montreal canadiens are surpassed in the number of championships only by the new york yankees of major league baseball who have three more
the longest streak of winning the stanley cup in consecutive years is five held by the montreal canadiens from to
the edition of the montreal canadiens the second of four straight stanley cup champions was named by espn as the second greatest sports team of all time
the next most successful nhl franchise is the toronto maple leafs with stanley cup championships most recently in
the detroit red wings with stanley cup championships are the most successful american franchise
the same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards
the stanley cup much like its canadian football league counterpart is unique in this aspect as opposed to the vince lombardi trophy larry o brien trophy and commissioner s trophy which have new ones made every year for that year s champion
despite only one trophy being used the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the stanley cup
the same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year
there are numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season they include among others the art ross trophy for the league scoring champion goals and assists the maurice rocket richard trophy for the goal scoring leader and the william m
jennings trophy for the goaltender s for the team with the fewest goals against them
the other player trophies are voted on by the professional hockey writers association or the team general managers
these individual awards are presented at a formal ceremony held in late june after the playoffs have concluded
the most prestigious individual award is the hart memorial trophy which is awarded annually to the most valuable player the voting is conducted by members of the professional hockey writers association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season
the vezina trophy is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goaltender as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the nhl
the james norris memorial trophy is awarded annually to the national hockey league s top defenceman the calder memorial trophy is awarded annually to the top rookie and the lady byng memorial trophy is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship all three of these awards are voted on by members of the professional hockey writers association
in addition to the regular season awards the conn smythe trophy is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the nhl s stanley cup playoffs
furthermore the top coach in the league wins the jack adams award as selected by a poll of the national hockey league broadcasters association
the national hockey league publishes the names of the top three vote getters for all awards and then names the award winner during the nhl awards ceremony
players coaches officials and team builders who have had notable careers are eligible to be voted into the hockey hall of fame
players cannot enter until three years have passed since their last professional game currently tied with the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame for the shortest such time period of any major sport
one unique consequence has been hall of fame members specifically gordie howe guy lafleur and mario lemieux coming out of retirement to play once more
if a player was deemed significant enough the three year wait would be waived only ten individuals have been honoured in this manner
in wayne gretzky joined the hall and became the last player to have the three year restriction waived
after his induction the hall of fame announced that gretzky would be the last to have the waiting period waived
in addition to canadian and american born and trained players who have historically composed a large majority of nhl rosters the nhl also draws players from an expanding pool of other nations where organized and professional hockey is played
since the collapse of the soviet bloc political ideological restrictions on the movement of hockey players from this region have disappeared leading to a large influx of players mostly from the czech republic slovakia and russia into the nhl
swedes finns and other western europeans who were always free to move to north america came to the league in greater numbers than before
many of the league s top players in recent years have come from these european countries including daniel alfredsson erik karlsson henrik sedin daniel sedin henrik lundqvist jaromir jagr patrik elias zdeno chara pavel datsyuk evgeni malkin nicklas lidstrom and alexander ovechkin
european players were drafted and signed by nhl teams in an effort to bring in more skilled offensive players although recently there has been a decline in european players as more american players enter the league
the addition of european players changed the style of play in the nhl and european style hockey has been integrated into the nhl game
as of the season the nhl has players from countries with coming from canada and from the united states while players from a further countries make up of nhl rosters
the following table shows the seven countries that make up the vast majority of nhl players
the table follows the hockey hall of fame convention of classifying players by the currently existing countries in which their birthplaces are located without regard to their citizenship or where they were trained
the nhl lists its several official corporate partners into three categories north american partners usa partners and canada partners
discover card is the league s official credit card in the us while competitor visa is an official sponsor in canada
likewise tim hortons is the league s official coffee and doughnuts chain in canada while dunkin donuts is the nhl s sponsor in the us
among its north american corporate sponsors kraft heinz sponsors kraft hockeyville an annual competition in which communities compete to demonstrate their commitment to the sport of ice hockey
the winning community gets a cash prize dedicated to upgrading their local home arena as well as the opportunity to host an nhl pre season game
two contests are held one for communities across canada and a separate competition for communities in the us
at least two of the north american corporate sponsors have ties to nhl franchise owners the molson family founders of molson brewery has owned the montreal canadiens for years while sap was co founded by hasso plattner the current majority owner of the san jose sharks
many of these same corporate partners become the title sponsors for the league s all star and outdoor games
beginning in the nhl season the league allowed for advertising on its gameday uniforms for the first time starting with helmet ads
the nhl will have advertising on the front of team jerseys for the first time starting in the season
on may nhl and the sports betting company betway announced a multi year partnership in which betway became the official sports betting partner to the nhl in north america
broadcasting rights in canada have historically included the cbc s hockey night in canada hnic a canadian tradition dating to and even prior to that on radio since the s
the current national television and digital rightsholder is rogers communications under a year deal valued at c billion which began in the season as the national broadcast and cable television rightsholders
national english language coverage of the nhl is carried primarily by rogers sportsnet group of specialty channels sportsnet holds national windows on wednesday and sunday nights
hockey night in canada was maintained and expanded under the deal airing up to seven games nationally on saturday nights throughout the regular season
cbc maintains rogers produced nhl coverage during the regular season and playoffs
sportsnet s networks also air occasional games involving all u s
matchups
quebecor media holds national french language rights to the nhl with all coverage airing on its specialty channel tva sports
games that are not broadcast as part of the national rights deal are broadcast by sportsnet s regional feeds tsn s regional feeds and rds
regional games are subject to blackout for viewers outside of each team s designated market
historically the nhl has never fared well on american television in comparison to the other american professional leagues
the league s american broadcast partners had been in flux for decades prior to
hockey broadcasting on a national scale was particularly spotty prior to nbc cbs and abc held rights at various times during that period but with limited schedules during the second half of the regular season and the playoffs along with some but not all of the stanley cup finals
the nhl primarily was then only available on cable television after airing on the usa network sportschannel america and espn at various times
since national coverage has been split between broadcast and cable first with fox and espn from to then followed by abc and espn from to
the u s
national rights were then held by nbc and oln later renamed versus then nbcsn between the nhl lockout and
the season marks the first year of seven year agreements with espn and turner sports
espn s deal includes regular season games on abc or espn and exclusive games streamed on espn and hulu
turner sports coverage includes up to regular season games on tnt or tbs
the playoffs will be split between espn and turner with abc televising the stanley cup finals during even years and tnt televising the championship series during odd years
as in canada games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team s home market and are subject to blackout outside of them
these broadcasters include regional sports network chains
certain national telecasts are non exclusive and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters
however national telecasts of these games are blacked out in the participating teams markets to protect the local broadcaster
the league co owns the nhl network a television specialty channel devoted to the nhl
its signature show is nhl tonight
the nhl network also airs live games but primarily simulcasts of one of the team s regional broadcasters
nhl centre ice in canada and nhl center ice in the united states are the league s subscription based out of market sports packages that offer access to out of market feeds of games through a cable or satellite television provider
the league originally launched nhl gamecenter live in allowing the streaming of out of market games over the internet
mlb advanced media then took over of its day to day operations in renaming it nhl tv
under its contract rogers communications distributes the service in canada as nhl live it will be incorporated into sportsnet now premium for the season
under espn s contract the league s out of market streaming package was incorporated into espn for those viewers in the united states in
outside of canada and the united states nhl games are broadcast across europe in the middle east in australia and in the americas across mexico central america dominican republic caribbean south america and brazil among others
nhl tv is also available for people in most countries to watch games online but blackout restrictions may still apply if a game is being televised in the user s country
for those in selected international markets where espn also holds the streaming rights they must instead access games on the espn platform used in that particular country espnplayer espn play the espn app or star
and those in denmark estonia finland iceland latvia lithuania poland norway and sweden must use viaplay
the national hockey league has occasionally participated in international club competitions
most of these competitions were arranged by the nhl or nhlpa
the first international club competition was held in with eight nhl teams playing against the soviet championship league s hc cska moscow and krylya sovetov moscow
between and the nhl and the soviet championship league would hold a number of exhibition games between the two leagues known as the super series
no nhl club had played a russian based club from the end of the super series in to when the new york rangers faced metallurg magnitogorsk in the victoria cup
in addition to the russian clubs nhl clubs had participated in a number of international club exhibitions and competitions with various european based clubs
the first exhibition game to feature an nhl team against a european based team aside from clubs based in the former soviet union was in december when the new york rangers faced poldi kladno of the czechoslovak first ice hockey league
in the s the nhl had organized four nhl challenge series between nhl and european clubs
from to the nhl organized exhibition games prior to the beginning of the season known as the nhl premiere between nhl clubs and teams from a number of european leagues
the nhl global series was the last nhl organized club competition involving european teams
nhl clubs have also participated in iihf organized club tournaments
the most recent iihf organized event including an nhl club was the victoria cup between the swiss national league a s zsc lions and the chicago blackhawks
