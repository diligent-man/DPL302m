The National Hockey League was established in as the successor to the National Hockey Association NHA Founded in the NHA began play in with seven teams in Ontario and Quebec and was one of the first major leagues in professional ice hockey However by its eighth season a series of disputes with Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone led team owners of the Montreal Canadiens the Montreal Wanderers the Ottawa Senators and the Quebec Bulldogs to hold a meeting to discuss the league's future Realizing the NHA constitution left them unable to force Livingstone out the four teams voted instead to suspend the NHA and on November formed the National Hockey League Frank Calder was chosen as the NHL's first president serving until his death in
The Bulldogs were unable to play in the NHL and the remaining owners founded the Toronto Arenas to compete with the Canadiens Wanderers and Senators The first games were played on December The Montreal Arena burned down in January causing the Wanderers to cease operations and the NHL continued on as a three team league until the Bulldogs returned in
The NHL replaced the NHA as one of the leagues that competed for the Stanley Cup an interleague competition at the time Toronto won the first NHL title and then defeated the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association PCHA for the Stanley Cup The Canadiens won the league title in but the series in the Stanley Cup Finals against the PCHA's Seattle Metropolitans was abandoned due to the Spanish Flu epidemic In Montreal won their first Stanley Cup as a member of the NHL The Hamilton Tigers won the regular season title in but refused to play in the championship series unless they were given a C bonus The league refused and declared the Canadiens the league champion after they defeated the Toronto St Patricks formerly the Arenas in the semi final Montreal was then defeated by the Victoria Cougars of the Western Canada Hockey League WCHL in It was the last time a non NHL team won the trophy as the Stanley Cup became the de facto NHL championship in after the WCHL ceased operation

By the mid s the desire for a network television contract in the United States coupled with concerns that the Western Hockey League was planning to declare itself a major league and challenge for the Stanley Cup spurred the NHL to undertake its first expansion since the s The league doubled in size to teams for the season adding the Los Angeles Kings the Minnesota North Stars the Philadelphia Flyers the Pittsburgh Penguins the California Seals and the St Louis Blues However Canadian fans were outraged that all six teams were placed in the United States so the league responded by adding the Vancouver Canucks in along with the Buffalo Sabres both located on the Canada United States border Two years later the emergence of the newly founded World Hockey Association WHA led the league to add the New York Islanders and the Atlanta Flames to keep the rival league out of those markets In the Washington Capitals and the Kansas City Scouts were added bringing the league up to teams
The NHL fought the WHA for players losing to the new league in its first season of including the Chicago Black Hawks' Bobby Hull who signed a ten year million contract with the Winnipeg Jets then the largest in hockey history The league attempted to block the defections in court but a counter suit by the WHA led to a Philadelphia judge ruling the NHL's reserve clause to be illegal thus eliminating the elder league's monopoly over the players Seven years of battling for players and markets financially damaged both leagues leading to a merger agreement in that saw the WHA cease operations while the NHL absorbed the Winnipeg Jets the Edmonton Oilers the Hartford Whalers and the Quebec Nordiques The owners initially rejected this merger agreement by one vote but a massive boycott of Molson Brewery products by Canadian fans resulted in the Montreal Canadiens which was owned by Molson reversing its position along with the Vancouver Canucks In a second vote the plan was approved
Wayne Gretzky played one season in the WHA for the Indianapolis Racers eight games and the Edmonton Oilers games before the Oilers joined the NHL for the season Gretzky went on to lead the Oilers to win four Stanley Cup championships in and and set single season records for goals in assists in and points in as well as career records for goals assists and points In he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in a deal that dramatically improved the league's popularity in the United States By the turn of the century nine more teams were added to the NHL the San Jose Sharks the Tampa Bay Lightning the Ottawa Senators the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim the Florida Panthers the Nashville Predators the Atlanta Thrashers now the Winnipeg Jets and in the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets On July the NHL confirmed that it had received applications from prospective ownership groups in Quebec City and Las Vegas for possible expansion teams and on June NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced the addition of a st franchise based in Las Vegas and later named the Vegas Golden Knights into the NHL for the season On December the league announced a nd franchise in Seattle later named the Seattle Kraken who joined in the season

With no new agreement in hand when the contract expired league commissioner Gary Bettman announced a lockout of the players union and closed the league's head office for the season The league vowed to install what it dubbed cost certainty for its teams but the Players' Association countered that the move was little more than a euphemism for a salary cap which the union initially said it would not accept The lockout shut down the league for days making it the longest in sports history as the NHL became the first professional sports league to lose an entire season A new collective bargaining agreement was eventually ratified in July including a salary cap The agreement had a term of six years with an option of extending the collective bargaining agreement for an additional year at the end of the term allowing the league to resume as of the season
On October the first post lockout season took to the ice with all teams The NHL received record attendance in the season with an average of per game However its television audience was slower to rebound due to American cable broadcaster ESPN's decision to drop its NHL coverage The league's post lockout agreement with NBC gave the league a share of revenue from each game's advertising sales rather than the usual lump sum paid up front for game rights The league's annual revenues were estimated at billion
On September the labour pact expired and the league again locked out the players The owners proposed reducing the players' share of hockey related revenues from percent to percent All games were cancelled up to January along with the NHL Winter Classic and the NHL All Star Weekend On January a tentative agreement was reached on a ten year deal On January the league and the Players' Association signed a memorandum of understanding on the new deal allowing teams to begin their training camps the next day with a shortened game season schedule that began on January

The National Hockey League's rules are one of the two standard sets of professional ice hockey rules in the world the other being the rules of the International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF as used in tournaments such as the Olympics The IIHF derived from the Canadian amateur ice hockey rules of the early th century while the NHL rules evolved directly from the first organized indoor ice hockey game in Montreal in updated by subsequent leagues up to when the NHL adopted the existing NHA set of rules The NHL's rules are the basis for rules governing most professional and major junior ice hockey leagues in North America
The NHL hockey rink is by feet m × m approximately the same length but much narrower than IIHF standards A trapezoidal area appears behind each goal net The goaltender can play the puck only within the trapezoid or in front of the goal line if the goaltender plays the puck behind the goal line and outside the trapezoidal area a two minute minor penalty for delay of game is assessed The rule is unofficially nicknamed the Martin Brodeur rule Brodeur at the time was one of the best goaltenders at getting behind the net to handle the puck Since the season the league trimmed the goal frames by inches cm on each side and reduced the size of the goalies' leg pads
The league has regularly modified its rules to counter perceived imperfections in the game The penalty shot was adopted from the Pacific Coast Hockey Association to ensure players were not being blocked from opportunities to score For the season the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside First the league removed the offside pass or two line pass rule which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team's defending zone was completed on the offensive side of the centre line unless the puck crossed the line before the player Furthermore the league reinstated the tag up offside which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid nineties and the increased prevalence of the neutral zone trap Since when a team is guilty of icing the puck they are not allowed to make a line change or skater substitution of any sort before the following face off except to replace an injured player or re install a pulled goaltender Since the league has used hybrid icing where a linesman stops play due to icing if a defending player other than the goaltender crosses the imaginary line that connects the two face off dots in their defensive zone before an attacking player is able to This was done to counter a trend of player injury in races to the puck
In the NHL fighting leads to major penalties while IIHF rules and most amateur rules call for the ejection of fighting players Usually a penalized team cannot replace a player that is penalized on the ice and is thus short handed for the duration of the penalty but if the penalties are coincidental for example when two players fight both teams remain at full strength Also unlike minor penalties major penalties must be served to their full completion regardless of number of goals scored during the power play
The league also imposes a conduct policy on its players Players are banned from gambling and criminal activities have led to the suspension of players The league and the Players' Association agreed to a stringent anti doping policy in the collective bargaining agreement The policy provides for a twenty game suspension for a first positive test a sixty game suspension for a second positive test and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test
At the end of regulation time the team with the most goals wins the game If a game is tied after regulation time overtime ensues During the regular season overtime is a five minute three on three sudden death period in which whoever scores a goal first wins the game If the game is still tied at the end of overtime the game enters a shootout Three players for each team in turn take a penalty shot The team with the most goals during the three round shootout wins the game If the game is still tied after the three shootout rounds the shootout continues but becomes sudden death Whichever team ultimately wins the shootout is awarded a goal in the game score and thus awarded two points in the standings The losing team in overtime or shootout is awarded one point Shootout goals and saves are not tracked in hockey statistics shootout statistics are tracked separately
There are no shootouts during the playoffs Instead multiple sudden death minute five on five periods are played until one team scores Two games have reached six overtime periods but none have gone beyond six During playoff overtime periods the only break is to clean the loose ice at the first stoppage after the period is halfway finished

During the regular season clubs play each other in a predefined schedule Since in the regular season all teams play games games each of home and road playing games in their own geographic division—four against five of their seven other divisional opponents plus three against two others games against the eight remaining non divisional intra conference opponents—three games against every team in the other division of its conference and against every team in the other conference twice—home and road
The league's regular season standings are based on a point system Two points are awarded for a win one point for losing in overtime or a shootout and zero points for a loss in regulation At the end of the regular season the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion and the league's overall leader is awarded the Presidents' Trophy
The Stanley Cup playoffs which go from April to the beginning of June are an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best of seven series in order to advance to the next round The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion Eight teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs the top three teams in each division plus the two conference teams with the next highest number of points The two conference champions proceed to the Stanley Cup Finals In all rounds the higher ranked team is awarded home ice advantage with four of the seven games played at this team's home venue In the Stanley Cup Finals the team with the most points during the regular season has home ice advantage
The annual NHL Entry Draft consists of a seven round off season draft held in late June Early NHL drafts took place at the Queen Elizabeth currently Fairmont Hotel in Montreal Amateur players from junior collegiate or European leagues are eligible to enter the Entry Draft The selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season playoff results and a draft lottery The teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round with the last place team having the best chance of winning the lottery Once the lottery determines the initial draft picks the order for the remaining non playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season For those teams that did qualify for the playoffs the draft order is then determined by total regular season points for non division winners that are eliminated in the first two rounds of the playoffs then any division winners that failed to reach the Conference Finals Conference finalists receive the th and th picks depending on total points with the Stanley Cup runner up given the st pick and the Stanley Cup champions the final pick
