Saint Rumbold or Rumold Romuold Latin Rumoldus Dutch Rombout French Rombaut was an Irish or Scottish Christian missionary although his true nationality is not known for certain
He was martyred near Mechelen by two men whom he had denounced for their evil ways
Saint Rumbold's feast day is celebrated by the Roman Catholic Church and Western Rite Orthodox Churches on June
and it is celebrated in Ireland on July
He is the patron saint of Mechelen where St Rumbold's Cathedral possesses an elaborate golden shrine on its high altar containing relics attributed to the saint It is rumoured that his remains are buried inside the cathedral Twenty five paintings in the choir illustrate his life
Rumbold is assumed to have been consecrated a regionary bishop at Rome Aodh Buidhe Mac an Bhaird c argued that Rumbold had been born in Ireland He is also said to have been a Bishop of Dublin the son of a Scottish king and the brother of St Himelin He is assumed to have worked under St Willibrord in the Netherlands and Brabant and also to have been a close companion of the hermit St Gummarus and of the preacher monk Fredegand van Deurne who according to one tradition maintained contact with St Foillan who was murdered in the Sonian Forest around
St Rumbold's biography written around AD by Theodoricus prior of Sint Truiden Abbey caused to be the traditional year of the saint's death The surrounding areas of Mechelen however had been Christianized much earlier
In a state of the art examination of the relics assumed to be St Rumbold's showed a death date between and
This would make Saint Rumbold a Hiberno Scottish rather than an Anglo Saxon missionary and not a contemporary of either St Willibrord St Himelin or St Gummarus
There has been some historical confusion between Rumbold of Mechelen and the infant Saint Rumwold of Buckingham who died in AD at the age of days The latter has become referred to as Romwold Rumwald Runwald Rumbald or Rumbold A compilation of three saints' lives as translated by Rosalind Love mentioned that on th century records in Salisbury an unknown author 'corrected' the attribution as martyr possibly the Rumbold murdered in Mechelen by annotating confessor fitting in the miraculous infant Rumwold who was not a martyr Also the original dedication of churches to a St Rumbold in Northern England appears uncertain
