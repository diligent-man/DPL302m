The Yellow Book of Lecan Leabhar Buidhe Leacin or TCD MS olim H is a late medieval Irish manuscript
It contains much of the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology besides other material
It is held in the Library of Trinity College Dublin
The manuscript is written on vellum and contains columns of text
The first were written by the remainder were written by
Lecan was the site of the Mac Fhirbhisigh school of poetry in the territory of Tr Fhacrach Maidhe now Lackan in Kilglass parish County Sligo °′″N °′″W﻿ ﻿°N °W﻿ -
The manuscript is currently housed at Trinity College Dublin
It should not be confused with the Great Book of Lecan
The book contains nearly the whole of the Ulster Cycle including a partial version of the Tin B Cailnge which is a compilation of two or more earlier versions indicated by the number of duplicated episodes and references to other versions in the text
This incomplete Tin B Cailnge overlaps with the partial version given in the Book of the Dun Cow the complete text known today was derived from the combination of these recensions
The version of Fergus mac Rich's death tale in the Yellow Book of Lecan is the oldest one that survives
The Yellow Book of Lecan also contains parts of the Tin B Flidhais or the Mayo Tin a tale set in Erris Co
In addition to that material which would be placed with certainty within the Ulster Cycle the book has a later version of The Voyage of Mel Din a collection of Irish triads and the same ogham tract as is recorded in the Book of Ballymote
Also of note is Suidiugud Tellaich Temra The settling of the manor of Tara
It contains a story of the life of Saint Patrick as told by Fintan mac Bchra that contains the account of Trefuilngid Tre-eochair a giant at the Hill of Tara who is first to hear about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ
Edward Lhuyd obtained the book from one of two sources Ruaidhr Ó Flaithbheartaigh about March at An Phirc An Spidal or from Dith Óg Ó Dubhda of Bunnyconnellan County Sligo in the same year
Ó Flaithbheartaigh and Ó Dubhda would have obtained them from Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh whose family created and preserved the book
Lhuyd bound together seventeen manuscripts as a single volume and dubbed them The Yellow Book of Lecan
Some of the manuscripts were written by Giolla Íosa Mr Mac Fhirbhisigh between c and c
Nollaig Ó Murale calls it a great composite manuscripts
Ninety-nine folios of Giolla Isa's survive which may be termed for convenience 'Leabhar Giolla Íosa' LGÍ containing some of the most important Irish literary texts from the Old and Middle Irish periods including the only virtually complete copy of Rescension I of Tin B Cailnge
Two colophons by Giolla Íosa indicate as the date of writing though the work may not have been brought to completion for some years after thatGiolla Íosa was assisted by his student Murchadh Ó Cuindlis
Ó Cuinnlis penned an excellent manuscript in east Ormond now County Tipperary in which is now part of YBL
Giolla Íosa wrote that he wrote this book for himself and for his son after him and elsewhere that it was for himself and his family after him
Ó Murale further states That is one index of Giolla Íosa Mac Fir Bhisigh's importance to his scribal labours we owe the preservation of the most celebrated of medieval Irish tales Tin B Cailnge p YBL also contains Aided Nath Í Togail Bruidne D Derga Tin B Frach Longes ma nUislenn D Brn Flatha Nime and Mesca Ulad by his son Toms Cam Mac Firbhisigh
In see below Professor Toms Ó Concheanainn stated his belief that much of the Yellow Book of LecanLeabhar Giolla Íosa was derived from Leabhar Gleann D Locha The Book of Glendalough and Lebor na Nuachongbla now The Book of Leinster
A fragment of the Yellow Book is in the hand of Solamh Ó Droma one of the three scribes of the Book of Ballymote
Lhuyd derived the title from a note by Ciothruadh Mac Fhirbhisigh
Leabar an Buide Leacain anim an leabhair so mise Cirruaidh mac Taidg Ruaidh
The Yellow Book of Lecan is the name of this book I am Ciothruagh son of Taidg Ruaidh
