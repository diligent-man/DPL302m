The manuscript is currently housed at Trinity College Dublin It should not be confused with the Great Book of Lecan
The book contains nearly the whole of the Ulster Cycle including a partial version of the T in B C ailnge which is a compilation of two or more earlier versions indicated by the number of duplicated episodes and references to other versions in the text This incomplete T in B C ailnge overlaps with the partial version given in the Book of the Dun Cow the complete text known today was derived from the combination of these recensions The version of Fergus mac R ich's death tale in the Yellow Book of Lecan is the oldest one that survives The Yellow Book of Lecan also contains parts of the T in B Flidhais or the Mayo T in a tale set in Erris Co Mayo
In addition to that material which would be placed with certainty within the Ulster Cycle the book has a later version of The Voyage of M el D in a collection of Irish triads and the same ogham tract as is recorded in the Book of Ballymote Also of note is Suidiugud Tellaich Temra The settling of the manor of Tara It contains a story of the life of Saint Patrick as told by Fintan mac B chra that contains the account of Trefuilngid Tre eochair a giant at the Hill of Tara who is first to hear about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ
Edward Lhuyd obtained the book from one of two sources Ruaidhr Flaithbheartaigh about March at An Ph irc An Spid al or from D ith g Dubhda of Bunnyconnellan County Sligo in the same year Flaithbheartaigh and Dubhda would have obtained them from Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh whose family created and preserved the book Lhuyd bound together seventeen manuscripts as a single volume and dubbed them The Yellow Book of Lecan
Some of the manuscripts were written by Giolla osa M r Mac Fhirbhisigh between c and c Nollaig Mura le calls it a great composite manuscripts Ninety nine folios of Giolla Isa's survive which may be termed for convenience 'Leabhar Giolla osa' LG containing some of the most important Irish literary texts from the Old and Middle Irish periods including the only virtually complete copy of Rescension I of T in B C ailnge Two colophons by Giolla osa indicate as the date of writing though the work may not have been brought to completion for some years after thatGiolla osa was assisted by his student Murchadh Cuindlis Cuinnlis penned an excellent manuscript in east Ormond now County Tipperary in which is now part of YBL
Giolla osa wrote that he wrote this book for himself and for his son after him and elsewhere that it was for himself and his family after him
Mura le further states That is one index of Giolla osa Mac Fir Bhisigh's importance to his scribal labours we owe the preservation of the most celebrated of medieval Irish tales T in B C ailnge p YBL also contains Aided Nath Togail Bruidne D Derga T in B Fra ch Longes ma nUislenn D Br n Flatha Nime and Mesca Ulad by his son Tom s Cam Mac Firbhisigh
In see below Professor Tom s Concheanainn stated his belief that much of the Yellow Book of Lecan Leabhar Giolla osa was derived from Leabhar Gleann D Locha The Book of Glendalough and Lebor na Nuachongb la now The Book of Leinster
A fragment of the Yellow Book is in the hand of Solamh Droma one of the three scribes of the Book of Ballymote
Lhuyd derived the title from a note by Ciothruadh Mac Fhirbhisigh
Leab ar an Buide Leacain anim an leabhair so mise Cirruaidh mac Taidg Ruaidh
The Yellow Book of Lecan is the name of this book I am Ciothruagh son of Taidg Ruaidh
