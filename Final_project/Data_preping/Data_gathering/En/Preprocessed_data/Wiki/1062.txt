edward osborne wilson june december was an american biologist naturalist and writer
his specialty was myrmecology the study of ants
according to david attenborough he was the world s leading expert
he was nicknamed the ant man
wilson has been called the father of sociobiology and the father of biodiversity for his environmental advocacy and his secular humanist and deist ideas pertaining to religious and ethical matters
among his contributions to ecological theory is the theory of island biogeography developed in collaboration with the mathematical ecologist robert macarthur which served as the foundation of the field of conservation area design as well as the unified neutral theory of biodiversity of stephen p
hubbell
wilson was the pellegrino university research professor emeritus in entomology for the department of organismic and evolutionary biology at harvard university a lecturer at duke university and a fellow of the committee for skeptical inquiry
the royal swedish academy awarded wilson the crafoord prize
he was a humanist laureate of the international academy of humanism
he was a two time winner of the pulitzer prize for general nonfiction for on human nature in and the ants in and a new york times bestselling author for the social conquest of earth letters to a young scientist and the meaning of human existence
wilson was recognized as one of the most important scientists and influential people in the world by time and the encyclop dia britannica
he received more than awards and medals and was an honorary member of more than organizations academies and institutions
several animal species have been scientifically named in his honor mostly ant species as well as one bird and one bat species
edward osborne wilson was born on june in birmingham alabama a single child to inez linnette freeman and edward osborne wilson
according to his autobiography naturalist he grew up in various towns in the southern united states including mobile alabama and pensacola florida
from an early age he was interested in natural history
his father was an alcoholic who eventually committed suicide
his parents allowed him to bring home black widow spiders and keep them on the porch
they divorced when he was seven
in the same year that his parents divorced wilson blinded himself in one eye in a fishing accident
he suffered for hours but he continued fishing
he did not complain because he was anxious to stay outdoors
he did not seek medical treatment
several months later his right pupil clouded over with a cataract
he was admitted to pensacola hospital to have the lens removed
wilson writes in his autobiography that the surgery was a terrifying th century ordeal
wilson retained full sight in his left eye with a vision of
the vision prompted him to focus on little things i noticed butterflies and ants more than other kids did and took an interest in them automatically
although he had lost his stereoscopic vision he could still see fine print and the hairs on the bodies of small insects
his reduced ability to observe mammals and birds led him to concentrate on insects
at the age of nine wilson undertook his first expeditions at the rock creek park in washington dc
he began to collect insects and he gained a passion for butterflies
he would capture them using nets made with brooms coat hangers and cheesecloth bags
going on these expeditions led to wilson s fascination with ants
he describes in his autobiography how one day he pulled the bark of a rotting tree away and discovered citronella ants underneath
the worker ants he found were short fat brilliant yellow and emitted a strong lemony odor
wilson said the event left a vivid and lasting impression on him
he also earned the eagle scout award and served as nature director of his boy scout summer camp
at age intent on becoming an entomologist he began by collecting flies but the shortage of insect pins caused by world war ii caused him to switch to ants which could be stored in vials
with the encouragement of marion r
smith a myrmecologist from the national museum of natural history in washington wilson began a survey of all the ants of alabama
this study led him to report the first colony of fire ants in the u s near the port of mobile
wilson said he went to or schools within years of schooling
wilson was concerned that he might not be able to afford to go to a university and tried to enlist in the united states army intending to earn u s
government financial support for his education
he failed the army medical examination due to his impaired eyesight but was able to afford to enroll in the university of alabama after all and earned his b s
and m s
degrees in biology there in
in wilson transferred to harvard university
appointed to the harvard society of fellows he could travel on overseas expeditions collecting ant species of cuba and mexico and travel the south pacific including australia new guinea fiji new caledonia and sri lanka
in he received his ph d
and married irene kelley
from until wilson was part of the faculty of harvard
he began as an ant taxonomist and worked on understanding their microevolution how they developed into new species by escaping environmental disadvantages and moving into new habitats
he developed a theory of the taxon cycle
in collaboration with mathematician william h
bossert wilson developed a classification of pheromones based on insect communication patterns
in the s he collaborated with mathematician and ecologist robert macarthur in developing the theory of species equilibrium
in the s he and daniel s
simberloff tested this theory on tiny mangrove islets in the florida keys
they eradicated all insect species and observed the re population by new species
wilson and macarthur s book the theory of island biogeography became a standard ecology text
in he published the insect societies which argues that insect behavior and the behavior of other animals are influenced by similar evolutionary pressures
in wilson was appointed the curator of entomology at the harvard museum of comparative zoology
in he published the book sociobiology the new synthesis applying his theories of insect behavior to vertebrates and in the last chapter humans
he speculated that evolved and inherited tendencies were responsible for hierarchical social organization among humans
in he published on human nature which dealt with the role of biology in the evolution of human culture and won a pulitzer prize for general nonfiction
wilson was named the frank b
baird jr professor of science in and after his retirement from harvard in became the pellegrino university professor emeritus
in after collaborating with charles lumsden he published genes mind and culture a theory of gene culture coevolution
in he published the ants co written with bert h lldobler his second pulitzer prize for general nonfiction
in the s he published the diversity of life an autobiography naturalist and consilience the unity of knowledge about the unity of the natural and social sciences
in wilson officially retired from harvard university where he continued to hold the positions of professor emeritus and honorary curator in entomology
he fully retired from harvard in at age
after stepping down he published more than a dozen books including a digital biology textbook for the ipad
he founded the e o
wilson biodiversity foundation which finances the pen e
wilson literary science writing award and is an independent foundation at the nicholas school of the environment duke university
wilson became a special lecturer at duke university as part of the agreement
wilson and his wife irene resided in lexington massachusetts
he had a daughter catherine
he was preceded in death by his wife on august and died in nearby burlington on december at the age of
wilson used sociobiology and evolutionary principles to explain the behavior of social insects and then to understand the social behavior of other animals including humans thus establishing sociobiology as a new scientific field
he argued that all animal behavior including that of humans is the product of heredity environmental stimuli and past experiences and that free will is an illusion
he referred to the biological basis of behavior as the genetic leash
the sociobiological view is that all animal social behavior is governed by epigenetic rules worked out by the laws of evolution
this theory and research proved to be seminal controversial and influential
wilson argued that the unit of selection is a gene the basic element of heredity
the target of selection is normally the individual who carries an ensemble of genes of certain kinds
with regard to the use of kin selection in explaining the behavior of eusocial insects the new view that i m proposing is that it was group selection all along an idea first roughly formulated by darwin
sociobiological research was at the time particularly controversial with regard to its application to humans
the theory established a scientific argument for rejecting the common doctrine of tabula rasa which holds that human beings are born without any innate mental content and that culture functions to increase human knowledge and aid in survival and success
sociobiology was initially met with substantial criticism
following its publication wilson was accused of racism misogyny and sympathy to eugenics
several of wilson s colleagues at harvard such as richard lewontin and stephen jay gould were strongly opposed to his work on sociobiology
gould lewontin and others from the sociobiology study group from the boston area associated with the organization science for the people wrote against sociobiology in an open letter criticizing wilson s deterministic view of human society and human action
other public lectures reading groups and press releases were organized criticizing wilson s work in response in march wilson produced a discussion article entitled academic vigilantism and the political significance of sociobiology in bioscience
over thirty years later in a interview wilson said i believe gould was a charlatan
i believe that he was
seeking reputation and credibility as a scientist and writer and he did it consistently by distorting what other scientists were saying and devising arguments based upon that distortion
philosopher mary midgley encountered sociobiology in the process of writing beast and man and significantly rewrote the book to offer a critique of wilson s views
midgley praised the book for the study of animal behavior clarity scholarship and encyclopedic scope but extensively critiqued wilson for conceptual confusion scientism and anthropomorphism of genetics
following the publication of sociobiology wilson extensively corresponded with and supported j
philippe rushton a controversial psychologist at the university of western ontario who later headed the pioneer fund
after wilson s death historians of science mark borrello and david sepkoski reassessed how wilson s thinking on issues of race and evolution was influenced by rushton
wilson wrote in his book on human nature the evolutionary epic is probably the best myth we will ever have wilson s fame prompted use of the morphed phrase epic of evolution
the book won the pulitzer prize in
wilson along with bert h lldobler carried out a systematic study of ants and ant behavior culminating in the encyclopedic work the ants
because much self sacrificing behavior on the part of individual ants can be explained on the basis of their genetic interests in the survival of the sisters with whom they share of their genes though the actual case is some species queens mate with multiple males and therefore some workers in a colony would only be related wilson argued for a sociobiological explanation for all social behavior on the model of the behavior of the social insects
wilson said in reference to ants karl marx was right socialism works it is just that he had the wrong species
he asserted that individual ants and other eusocial species were able to reach higher darwinian fitness putting the needs of the colony above their own needs as individuals because they lack reproductive independence individual ants cannot reproduce without a queen so they can only increase their fitness by working to enhance the fitness of the colony as a whole
humans however do possess reproductive independence and so individual humans enjoy their maximum level of darwinian fitness by looking after their own survival and having their own offspring
in his book consilience the unity of knowledge wilson discussed methods that have been used to unite the sciences and might be able to unite the sciences with the humanities
he argued that knowledge is a single unified thing not divided between science and humanistic inquiry
wilson used the term consilience to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different specialized fields of human endeavor
he defined human nature as a collection of epigenetic rules the genetic patterns of mental development
he argued that culture and rituals are products not parts of human nature
he said art is not part of human nature but our appreciation of art is
he suggested that concepts such as art appreciation fear of snakes or the incest taboo westermarck effect could be studied by scientific methods of the natural sciences and be part of interdisciplinary research
wilson coined the phrase scientific humanism as the only worldview compatible with science s growing knowledge of the real world and the laws of nature
wilson argued that it is best suited to improve the human condition
in he was one of the signers of the humanist manifesto
on the question of god wilson described his position as provisional deism and explicitly denied the label of atheist preferring agnostic
he explained his faith as a trajectory away from traditional beliefs i drifted away from the church not definitively agnostic or atheistic just baptist christian no more wilson argued that belief in god and the rituals of religion are products of evolution
he argued that they should not be rejected or dismissed but further investigated by science to better understand their significance to human nature
in his book the creation wilson wrote that scientists ought to offer the hand of friendship to religious leaders and build an alliance with them stating that science and religion are two of the most potent forces on earth and they should come together to save the creation
wilson made an appeal to the religious community on the lecture circuit at midland college texas for example and that the appeal received a massive reply that a covenant had been written and that a partnership will work to a substantial degree as time goes on
in a new scientist interview published on january however wilson said that religion is dragging us down and must be eliminated for the sake of human progress and so i would say that for the sake of human progress the best thing we could possibly do would be to diminish to the point of eliminating religious faiths
wilson said that if he could start his life over he would work in microbial ecology when discussing the reinvigoration of his original fields of study since the s
he studied the mass extinctions of the th century and their relationship to modern society and in argued for an ecological approach at the capitol
from the late s wilson was actively involved in the global conservation of biodiversity contributing and promoting research
in he published biophilia a work that explored the evolutionary and psychological basis of humanity s attraction to the natural environment
this work introduced the word biophilia which influenced the shaping of modern conservation ethics
in wilson edited the biodiversity volume based on the proceedings of the first us national conference on the subject which also introduced the term biodiversity into the language
this work was very influential in creating the modern field of biodiversity studies
in wilson led scientific expeditions to the gorongosa national park in mozambique and the archipelagos of vanuatu and new caledonia in the southwest pacific
wilson was part of the international conservation movement as a consultant to columbia university s earth institute as a director of the american museum of natural history conservation international the nature conservancy and the world wildlife fund
understanding the scale of the extinction crisis led him to advocate for forest protection including the act to save america s forests first introduced in until but never passed
the forests now declaration calls for new markets based mechanisms to protect tropical forests
wilson once said destroying a rainforest for economic gain was like burning a renaissance painting to cook a meal
in wilson called for setting aside of the earth s surface for other species to thrive in as the only possible strategy to solve the extinction crisis
wilson s influence regarding ecology through popular science was covered by alan g
gross in the scientific sublime
wilson was instrumental in launching the encyclopedia of life eol initiative with the goal of creating a global database to include information on the million species recognized by science
currently it includes information on practically all known species
this open and searchable digital repository for organism traits measurements interactions and other data has more than international partners and countless scientists to provide global user access to knowledge of life on earth
for his part wilson discovered and described more than species of ants
