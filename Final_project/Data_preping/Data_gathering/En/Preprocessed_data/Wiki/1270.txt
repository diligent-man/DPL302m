The North Borneo Chartered Company NBCC also known as the British North Borneo Company BNBC was a British chartered company formed on November to administer and exploit the resources of North Borneo present day Sabah in Malaysia The territory became a protectorate of the British Empire in but the company remained involved with the territory until when administration was fully assumed by the Crown colony government
The company also temporarily administered the island of Labuan in before it became part of the Straits Settlements The company motto was Pergo et Perago which means I persevere and I achieve in Latin Its founder and first chairman was Alfred Dent
The company was founded along similar lines as the British East India Company German businessman and diplomat Baron von Overbeck along with the heads of a British trading company in Shanghai and London Alfred Dent and Edward Dent together met with the thalassocratic rulers of the northern Borneo area to obtain a concession for their colonial interests The governor of Labuan a British colonial island off Brunei accompanied the negotiations On December they met Abdul Momin Sultan of Brunei The Sultan agreed to make the concession for Spanish dollars However since it turned out that the Sultan of Brunei had already ceded some areas to the Sultan of Sulu further negotiations were needed With the assistance of William Clark Cowie a Scottish adventurer and friend of Sultan Jamal ul Azam of Sulu the Sultan signed a concession treaty on January and received Spanish dollars
Following the successful concessions Overbeck and the Dent brothers became the rulers of an area in northern Borneo Overbeck withdrew in after failing to attract the interest of his country leaving Alfred Dent to manage the territory Dent then planned to register a company to represent the British but since a considerably delay seemed likely he decided to found a provisional company first In the British North Borneo Provisional Association Limited was founded with registered capital of The directors were Dent himself together with Rutherford Alcock Richard Biddulph Martin Admiral Richard Mayne and William Henry Read The charter contract for a company with a capital of two million pounds was sealed on November
The provisional company was thus dissolved and the following year a chartered company was established with a first settlement on Gaya Island The settlement however was burnt down during a raid by a local leader named Mat Salleh and was never re established Due to such resistance establishing law and order as well as recruiting Sikh policemen from northern India became one of the company's earlies priorities along with expanding trade instituting a government courts and penal system building a railway line from Jesselton to Tenom and encouraging the harvesting and barter trade of local crops as well as establishment of plantations The company also faced some resistance to its economic modernisations and tax policies
No other state in the British Commonwealth was as devastated by the Second World War as North Borneo By the end of the war it was already foreseeable that the company would be unable to finance remediation for the devastation to land and infrastructure The company therefore waived the further use of their charter and gave British North Borneo to the British Colonial Office With the signing of an agreement on June the company officially dissolved From July until the formation of Malaysia on September North Borneo was a Crown colony The agreement with the British government included a immediate cash settlement that allowed the company to settle outstanding financial claims The government's offer to repay all other claims by paying million pounds had already been rejected by the company For the negotiation of further financial compensation the British government appointed Lord Uthwatt as an independent arbitrator In March Uthwatt announced the result of his investigations should be awarded to the company as compensation any claims related to war damage would not be included The news triggered a bitter disappointment among shareholders In just overnight the value of the company share fell from s to s p
With the founding of the company the administrative divisions of North Borneo introduced by Overbeck were maintained by the establishment of the West Coast Residency and the East Coast Residency The seat of the two residents was in Sandakan where the governor was based Each residency in turn was divided into several provinces managed by a district officer Over time the number of residencies increased to five Tawau Residency also known as East Coast Residency Sandakan Residency West Coast Residency Kudat Residency and Interior Residency The provinces were initially named after the members of the board Alcock Cunlife Dewhurst Keppel Dent Martin Elphinstone Myburgh and Mayne The senior residents occupied Sandakan and the West Coast while the other three residents with the second class residencies occupied Interior East Coast and Kudat The residents of Sandakan and West Coast were members of the Legislative Council the Legislative Assembly of the Company
The election of Cowie to the board of directors in marked the beginning of a major change in the style of administration Before North Borneo was governed by the company and the governors were fully empowered and fully responsible But since Cowie took over he mostly pulled strings from London Instead of the development of North Borneo the satisfaction of the shareholders was in the foreground Alfred Dent who fiercely opposed Cowie's costly and money wasting ideas finally resigned and withdrew from the company
Under Neill Malcolm the administration was ordered to strictly supervise expenditure Several governors reduced the number of district officers by eliminating the posts in Ranau Pensiangan Tenom Sipitang Penampang Tuaran Langkon Lamag Beluran and Semporna Douglas James Jardine who become the governor in completed the process by merging the Tawau Residency with the Sandakan Residency on the one hand and the Interior Residency with the West Coast on the other hand He also removed the District Officer in Papar
Municipal administration was governed by the Village Ordinance of This ordinance fundamentally changed the status of the chiefs the traditional indigenous tribal leaders Following its implementation the company only accepted those chiefs who had appointed them as community leaders Other chieftains who had played an important role for generations were either shut down or branded as criminals or troublemakers Disrespect for these traditional leaders contributed to the spirit of local resistance led by tribal group such as Mat Salleh and Ontoros Antanum
The company had two responsibilities namely
Economic development through the exploitation of natural resources of the area The company was authorised to use the area for agriculture to settle it to promote immigration to mine and to cut wood An employee of the company and later plantation owner in North Borneo Owen Rutter openly named the purpose of producing dividends
Due to the experience of the decline of the British East India Company a passage was written to protect the rights of the residents The company was legally responsible for protecting the customs and rights of its residents but in practice it had to pay dividends which often limited those rights The first governor of North Borneo William Hood Treacher devoted himself especially to the elimination of slavery However the land laws issued by him in no way respected the traditional land rights of the inhabitants The second governor Charles Vandeleur Creagh in issued several proclamations that largely secured foreigners' access to land A board of directors in London determined the tasks of the company over the governors Locally directors over ruled the governor's instructions The company established a state power issued laws proclamations recruited Sikh policemen from northern India Courts were set up to enforce the laws Furthering the economic exploitation of the area was the construction of a railway line North Borneo Railway from Jesselton to Weston and Melalap the promotion of trade and the establishment of plantations Effective from March the periodical North Borneo Herald and Official Gazette was published to disseminate the decisions of the Court of Directors both within the administrative units of North Borneo and the company's shareholders and investors
A major contribution to the consolidation of the administrative area was made by William Hood Treacher In tough negotiations with the White Rajahs he managed to bring territories to the company that were not included in the original leases These includes Pengalat Klias Peninsular Mantanani Padas and the area of Sipitang Bongawan to Tuaran From the island of Labuan was also part of the company administrative territory
Although the Netherlands had already installed a trading post in Borneo shortly after the founding of the Dutch East India Company there were no noteworthy activities by the Dutch on the east coast of northern Borneo This changed in when the Dutch signed a contract with the Sultan of Bulungan who assured the Dutch control of the area At the instigation of the Dutch the sultan married his son in with the daughter of the Sultan of Tarakan whereby the Dutch sphere of influence finally reached the region around Tawau The north of the Dutch area which overlapped with an area that was claimed by the Sultanate of Sulu for themselves A conflict with the British was therefore inevitable when in the Sultan of Sulu placed the southern boundary of his land for tax to Overbeck on the Sibuku River In settling the border disputes the company negotiated with the Dutch from the s onwards to define the boundary between the area granted by the Sultan of Sulu and the area claimed by the Dutch on the basis of the treaty with the Sultan of Bulungan On January they finally agreed on a line along ' north latitude which corresponded to a central division of the island of Sebatik
