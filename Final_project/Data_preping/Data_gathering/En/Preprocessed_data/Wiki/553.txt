in thermodynamics heat is energy in transfer to or from a thermodynamic system by mechanisms other than thermodynamic work or transfer of matter e g
conduction radiation and friction
like thermodynamic work heat transfer involves the surroundings of a system as well as the system itself and so is not a property of the system alone though it contributes to change in the system s internal energy which is a property of the system alone
this is distinct from the ordinary language usage of the word heat as a property of a system in itself
the quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process is the amount of transferred energy excluding any thermodynamic work that was done and any energy contained in matter transferred
for the precise definition of heat it is necessary that it occur by a path that does not include transfer of matter
for example radiative heat transfer can co occur with matter transfer
though not immediately by the definition but in special kinds of process quantity of energy transferred as heat can be measured by its effect on the states of interacting bodies
for example respectively in special circumstances heat transfer can be measured by the amount of ice melted or by change in temperature of a body in the surroundings of the system
such methods are called calorimetry
the conventional symbol used to represent the amount of heat transferred in a thermodynamic process is q or q
as an amount of energy being transferred the si unit of heat is the joule j
the mechanisms of energy transfer that define heat include conduction through direct contact of immobile bodies or through a wall or barrier that is impermeable to matter or radiation between separated bodies or friction due to isochoric mechanical or electrical or magnetic or gravitational work done by the surroundings on the system of interest such as joule heating due to an electric current driven through the system of interest by an external system or through a magnetic stirrer
when there is a suitable path between two systems with different temperatures heat transfer occurs necessarily immediately and spontaneously from the hotter to the colder system
thermal conduction occurs by the stochastic random motion of microscopic particles such as atoms or molecules
in contrast thermodynamic work is defined by mechanisms that act macroscopically and directly on the system s whole body state variables for example change of the system s volume through a piston s motion with externally measurable force or change of the system s internal electric polarization through an externally measurable change in electric field
the definition of heat transfer does not require that the process be in any sense smooth
for example a bolt of lightning may transfer heat to a body
convective circulation allows one body to heat another through an intermediate circulating fluid that carries energy from a boundary of one to a boundary of the other the actual heat transfer is by conduction and radiation between the fluid and the respective bodies
convective circulation though spontaneous does not necessarily and immediately occur simply because of some slight temperature difference for it to occur in a given arrangement of systems there is a threshold that must be crossed
although heat flows spontaneously from a hotter body to a cooler one it is possible to construct a heat pump which expends work to transfer energy from a colder body to a hotter body
in contrast a heat engine reduces an existing temperature difference to supply work to another system
another thermodynamic type of heat transfer device is an active heat spreader which expends work to speed up transfer of energy to colder surroundings from a hotter body for example a computer component
as a form of energy heat has the unit joule j in the international system of units si
however in many applied fields in engineering the british thermal unit btu and the calorie are often used
the standard unit for the rate of heat transferred is the watt w defined as one joule per second
the symbol q for the total amount of energy transferred as heat was used by rudolf clausius in
let the amount of heat which must be imparted during the transition of the gas in a definite manner from any given state to another in which its volume is v and its temperature t be called q heat released by a system into its surroundings is by convention a negative quantity q when a system absorbs heat from its surroundings it is positive q
heat transfer rate or heat flow per unit time is denoted by
displaystyle dot q
this should not be confused with a time derivative of a function of state which can also be written with the dot notation since heat is not a function of state
heat flux is defined as rate of heat transfer per unit cross sectional area units watts per square metre
in rudolf clausius referring to closed systems in which transfers of matter do not occur defined the second fundamental theorem the second law of thermodynamics in the mechanical theory of heat thermodynamics if two transformations which without necessitating any other permanent change can mutually replace one another be called equivalent then the generations of the quantity of heat q from work at the temperature t has the equivalence value
displaystyle frac q t
in he came to define the entropy symbolized by s such that due to the supply of the amount of heat q at temperature t the entropy of the system is increased by
displaystyle delta s frac q t
in a transfer of energy as heat without work being done there are changes of entropy in both the surroundings which lose heat and the system which gains it
the increase s of entropy in the system may be considered to consist of two parts an increment s that matches or compensates the change s of entropy in the surroundings and a further increment s that may be considered to be generated or produced in the system and is said therefore to be uncompensated
displaystyle delta s delta s delta s
this may also be written
displaystyle delta s mathrm system delta s mathrm compensated delta s mathrm uncompensated text with delta s mathrm compensated delta s mathrm surroundings
the total change of entropy in the system and surroundings is thus
displaystyle delta s mathrm overall delta s prime delta s prime prime delta s prime delta s prime prime
this may also be written
displaystyle delta s mathrm overall delta s mathrm compensated delta s mathrm uncompensated delta s mathrm surroundings delta s mathrm uncompensated
it is then said that an amount of entropy s has been transferred from the surroundings to the system
because entropy is not a conserved quantity this is an exception to the general way of speaking in which an amount transferred is of a conserved quantity
from the second law of thermodynamics follows that in a spontaneous transfer of heat in which the temperature of the system is different from that of the surroundings
displaystyle delta s mathrm overall
for purposes of mathematical analysis of transfers one thinks of fictive processes that are called reversible with the temperature t of the system being hardly less than that of the surroundings and the transfer taking place at an imperceptibly slow rate
following the definition above in formula for such a fictive reversible process a quantity of transferred heat q an inexact differential is analyzed as a quantity t ds with ds an exact differential
displaystyle t mathrm d s delta q
this equality is only valid for a fictive transfer in which there is no production of entropy that is to say in which there is no uncompensated entropy
if in contrast the process is natural and can really occur with irreversibility then there is entropy production with dsuncompensated
the quantity t dsuncompensated was termed by clausius the uncompensated heat though that does not accord with present day terminology
then one has
displaystyle t surr mathrm d s delta q t mathrm d s mathrm uncompensated delta q
this leads to the statement
second law
displaystyle t surr mathrm d s geq delta q quad text second law
which is the second law of thermodynamics for closed systems
in non equilibrium thermodynamics that makes the approximation of assuming the hypothesis of local thermodynamic equilibrium there is a special notation for this
the transfer of energy as heat is assumed to take place across an infinitesimal temperature difference so that the system element and its surroundings have near enough the same temperature t
then one writes
displaystyle mathrm d s mathrm d s mathrm e mathrm d s mathrm i
where by definition
displaystyle delta q t mathrm d s mathrm e text and mathrm d s mathrm i equiv mathrm d s mathrm uncompensated
the second law for a natural process asserts that
displaystyle mathrm d s mathrm i
for a closed system a system from which no matter can enter or exit one version of the first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy u of the system is equal to the amount of heat q supplied to the system minus the amount of thermodynamic work w done by system on its surroundings
the foregoing sign convention for work is used in the present article but an alternate sign convention followed by iupac for work is to consider the work performed on the system by its surroundings as positive
this is the convention adopted by many modern textbooks of physical chemistry such as those by peter atkins and ira levine but many textbooks on physics define work as work done by the system
displaystyle delta u q w
this formula can be re written so as to express a definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat based purely on the concept of adiabatic work if it is supposed that u is defined and measured solely by processes of adiabatic work
displaystyle q delta u w
the thermodynamic work done by the system is through mechanisms defined by its thermodynamic state variables for example its volume v not through variables that necessarily involve mechanisms in the surroundings
the latter are such as shaft work and include isochoric work
the internal energy u is a state function
in cyclical processes such as the operation of a heat engine state functions of the working substance return to their initial values upon completion of a cycle
the differential or infinitesimal increment for the internal energy in an infinitesimal process is an exact differential du
the symbol for exact differentials is the lowercase letter d
in contrast neither of the infinitesimal increments q nor w in an infinitesimal process represents the change in a state function of the system
thus infinitesimal increments of heat and work are inexact differentials
the lowercase greek letter delta is the symbol for inexact differentials
the integral of any inexact differential in a process where the system leaves and then returns to the same thermodynamic state does not necessarily equal zero
as recounted above in the section headed heat and entropy the second law of thermodynamics observes that if heat is supplied to a system in a reversible process the increment of heat q and the temperature t form the exact differential
displaystyle mathrm d s frac delta q t
and that s the entropy of the working body is a state function
likewise with a well defined pressure p behind a slowly moving quasistatic boundary the work differential w and the pressure p combine to form the exact differential
displaystyle mathrm d v frac delta w p
with v the volume of the system which is a state variable
in general for systems of uniform pressure and temperature without composition change
displaystyle mathrm d u t mathrm d s p mathrm d v
associated with this differential equation is the concept that the internal energy may be considered to be a function u s v of its natural variables s and v
the internal energy representation of the fundamental thermodynamic relation is written as
displaystyle u u s v
if v is constant
constant
displaystyle t mathrm d s mathrm d u v text constant
and if p is constant
constant
displaystyle t mathrm d s mathrm d h p text constant
with the enthalpy h defined by
displaystyle h u pv
the enthalpy may be considered to be a function h s p of its natural variables s and p
the enthalpy representation of the fundamental thermodynamic relation is written
displaystyle h h s p
the internal energy representation and the enthalpy representation are partial legendre transforms of one another
they contain the same physical information written in different ways
like the internal energy the enthalpy stated as a function of its natural variables is a thermodynamic potential and contains all thermodynamic information about a body
if a quantity q of heat is added to a body while it does only expansion work w on its surroundings one has
displaystyle delta h delta u delta pv
if this is constrained to happen at constant pressure i e
with p the expansion work w done by the body is given by w p v recalling the first law of thermodynamics one has
displaystyle delta u q w q p delta v text and delta pv p delta v
consequently by substitution one has
at constant pressure without electrical work
displaystyle begin aligned delta h q p delta v p delta v q qquad qquad text at constant pressure without electrical work end aligned
in this scenario the increase in enthalpy is equal to the quantity of heat added to the system
this is the basis of the determination of enthalpy changes in chemical reactions by calorimetry
since many processes do take place at constant atmospheric pressure the enthalpy is sometimes given the misleading name of heat content or heat function while it actually depends strongly on the energies of covalent bonds and intermolecular forces
in terms of the natural variables s and p of the state function h this process of change of state from state to state can be expressed as
at constant pressure without electrical work
displaystyle begin aligned delta h int s s left frac partial h partial s right p mathrm d s int p p left frac partial h partial p right s mathrm d p int s s left frac partial h partial s right p mathrm d s text at constant pressure without electrical work end aligned
it is known that the temperature t s p is identically stated by
displaystyle left frac partial h partial s right p equiv t s p
consequently
at constant pressure without electrical work
displaystyle delta h int s s t s p mathrm d s text at constant pressure without electrical work
in this case the integral specifies a quantity of heat transferred at constant pressure
as a common noun english heat or warmth just as french chaleur german w rme latin calor greek etc refers to the human perception of either thermal energy or temperature
speculation on thermal energy or heat as a separate form of matter has a long history see caloric theory phlogiston and fire classical element
the modern understanding of thermal energy originates with thompson s mechanical theory of heat an experimental enquiry concerning the source of the heat which is excited by friction postulating a mechanical equivalent of heat
a collaboration between nicolas cl ment and sadi carnot reflections on the motive power of fire in the s had some related thinking along similar lines
in joule published a paper entitled the mechanical equivalent of heat in which he specified a numerical value for the amount of mechanical work required to produce a unit of heat
the theory of classical thermodynamics matured in the s to s
john tyndall s heat considered as mode of motion was instrumental in popularizing the idea of heat as motion to the english speaking public
the theory was developed in academic publications in french english and german
from an early time the french technical term chaleur used by carnot was taken as equivalent to the english heat and german w rme lit
warmth while the equivalent of heat would be german hitze
the process function q was introduced by rudolf clausius in
clausius described it with the german compound w rmemenge translated as amount of heat
james clerk maxwell in his theory of heat outlines four stipulations for the definition of heat
it is something which may be transferred from one body to another according to the second law of thermodynamics
it is a measurable quantity and so can be treated mathematically
it cannot be treated as a material substance because it may be transformed into something that is not a material substance e g mechanical work
heat is one of the forms of energy the process function q is referred to as w rmemenge by clausius or as amount of heat in translation
use of heat as an abbreviated form of the specific concept of quantity of energy transferred as heat led to some terminological confusion by the early th century
the generic meaning of heat even in classical thermodynamics is just thermal energy
since the s it has been recommended practice to use enthalpy to refer to the heat content at constant volume and to thermal energy when heat in the general sense is intended while heat is reserved for the very specific context of the transfer of thermal energy between two systems
leonard benedict loeb in his kinetic theory of gases makes a point of using quantity of heat
or heat quantity when referring to q
after the perfection of thermometry the next great advance made in the field of heat was the definition of a term which is called the quantity of heat
after the abandonment of caloric theory it still remains to interpret this very definite concept the quantity of heat in terms of a theory ascribing all heat to the kinetics of gas molecules
a frequent definition of heat is based on the work of carath odory referring to processes in a closed system
the internal energy ux of a body in an arbitrary state x can be determined by amounts of work adiabatically performed by the body on its surroundings when it starts from a reference state o
such work is assessed through quantities defined in the surroundings of the body
it is supposed that such work can be assessed accurately without error due to friction in the surroundings friction in the body is not excluded by this definition
the adiabatic performance of work is defined in terms of adiabatic walls which allow transfer of energy as work but no other transfer of energy or matter
in particular they do not allow the passage of energy as heat
according to this definition work performed adiabatically is in general accompanied by friction within the thermodynamic system or body
on the other hand according to carath odory there also exist non adiabatic diathermal walls which are postulated to be permeable only to heat
for the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat it is customarily envisaged that an arbitrary state of interest y is reached from state o by a process with two components one adiabatic and the other not adiabatic
for convenience one may say that the adiabatic component was the sum of work done by the body through volume change through movement of the walls while the non adiabatic wall was temporarily rendered adiabatic and of isochoric adiabatic work
then the non adiabatic component is a process of energy transfer through the wall that passes only heat newly made accessible for the purpose of this transfer from the surroundings to the body
the change in internal energy to reach the state y from the state o is the difference of the two amounts of energy transferred
although carath odory himself did not state such a definition following his work it is customary in theoretical studies to define heat q to the body from its surroundings in the combined process of change to state y from the state o as the change in internal energy uy minus the amount of work w done by the body on its surrounds by the adiabatic process so that q uy w
in this definition for the sake of conceptual rigour the quantity of energy transferred as heat is not specified directly in terms of the non adiabatic process
it is defined through knowledge of precisely two variables the change of internal energy and the amount of adiabatic work done for the combined process of change from the reference state o to the arbitrary state y
it is important that this does not explicitly involve the amount of energy transferred in the non adiabatic component of the combined process
it is assumed here that the amount of energy required to pass from state o to state y the change of internal energy is known independently of the combined process by a determination through a purely adiabatic process like that for the determination of the internal energy of state x above
the rigour that is prized in this definition is that there is one and only one kind of energy transfer admitted as fundamental energy transferred as work
energy transfer as heat is considered as a derived quantity
the uniqueness of work in this scheme is considered to guarantee rigor and purity of conception
the conceptual purity of this definition based on the concept of energy transferred as work as an ideal notion relies on the idea that some frictionless and otherwise non dissipative processes of energy transfer can be realized in physical actuality
the second law of thermodynamics on the other hand assures us that such processes are not found in nature
before the rigorous mathematical definition of heat based on carath odory s paper
historically heat temperature and thermal equilibrium were presented in thermodynamics textbooks as jointly primitive notions
carath odory introduced his paper thus the proposition that the discipline of thermodynamics can be justified without recourse to any hypothesis that cannot be verified experimentally must be regarded as one of the most noteworthy results of the research in thermodynamics that was accomplished during the last century referring to the point of view adopted by most authors who were active in the last fifty years carath odory wrote there exists a physical quantity called heat that is not identical with the mechanical quantities mass force pressure etc and whose variations can be determined by calorimetric measurements james serrin introduces an account of the theory of thermodynamics thus in the following section we shall use the classical notions of heat work and hotness as primitive elements
that heat is an appropriate and natural primitive for thermodynamics was already accepted by carnot
its continued validity as a primitive element of thermodynamical structure is due to the fact that it synthesizes an essential physical concept as well as to its successful use in recent work to unify different constitutive theories this traditional kind of presentation of the basis of thermodynamics includes ideas that may be summarized by the statement that heat transfer is purely due to spatial non uniformity of temperature and is by conduction and radiation from hotter to colder bodies
it is sometimes proposed that this traditional kind of presentation necessarily rests on circular reasoning against this proposal there stands the rigorously logical mathematical development of the theory presented by truesdell and bharatha
this alternative approach to the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat differs in logical structure from that of carath odory recounted just above
this alternative approach admits calorimetry as a primary or direct way to measure quantity of energy transferred as heat
it relies on temperature as one of its primitive concepts and used in calorimetry
it is presupposed that enough processes exist physically to allow measurement of differences in internal energies
such processes are not restricted to adiabatic transfers of energy as work
they include calorimetry which is the commonest practical way of finding internal energy differences
the needed temperature can be either empirical or absolute thermodynamic
in contrast the carath odory way recounted just above does not use calorimetry or temperature in its primary definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat
the carath odory way regards calorimetry only as a secondary or indirect way of measuring quantity of energy transferred as heat
as recounted in more detail just above the carath odory way regards quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process as primarily or directly defined as a residual quantity
it is calculated from the difference of the internal energies of the initial and final states of the system and from the actual work done by the system during the process
that internal energy difference is supposed to have been measured in advance through processes of purely adiabatic transfer of energy as work processes that take the system between the initial and final states
by the carath odory way it is presupposed as known from experiment that there actually physically exist enough such adiabatic processes so that there need be no recourse to calorimetry for measurement of quantity of energy transferred as heat
this presupposition is essential but is explicitly labeled neither as a law of thermodynamics nor as an axiom of the carath odory way
in fact the actual physical existence of such adiabatic processes is indeed mostly supposition and those supposed processes have in most cases not been actually verified empirically to exist
referring to conduction partington writes if a hot body is brought in conducting contact with a cold body the temperature of the hot body falls and that of the cold body rises and it is said that a quantity of heat has passed from the hot body to the cold body
referring to radiation maxwell writes in radiation the hotter body loses heat and the colder body receives heat by means of a process occurring in some intervening medium which does not itself thereby become hot
maxwell writes that convection as such is not a purely thermal phenomenon
in thermodynamics convection in general is regarded as transport of internal energy
if however the convection is enclosed and circulatory then it may be regarded as an intermediary that transfers energy as heat between source and destination bodies because it transfers only energy and not matter from the source to the destination body
in accordance with the first law for closed systems energy transferred solely as heat leaves one body and enters another changing the internal energies of each
transfer between bodies of energy as work is a complementary way of changing internal energies
though it is not logically rigorous from the viewpoint of strict physical concepts a common form of words that expresses this is to say that heat and work are interconvertible
cyclically operating engines that use only heat and work transfers have two thermal reservoirs a hot and a cold one
they may be classified by the range of operating temperatures of the working body relative to those reservoirs
in a heat engine the working body is at all times colder than the hot reservoir and hotter than the cold reservoir
in a sense it uses heat transfer to produce work
in a heat pump the working body at stages of the cycle goes both hotter than the hot reservoir and colder than the cold reservoir
in a sense it uses work to produce heat transfer
in classical thermodynamics a commonly considered model is the heat engine
it consists of four bodies the working body the hot reservoir the cold reservoir and the work reservoir
a cyclic process leaves the working body in an unchanged state and is envisaged as being repeated indefinitely often
work transfers between the working body and the work reservoir are envisaged as reversible and thus only one work reservoir is needed
but two thermal reservoirs are needed because transfer of energy as heat is irreversible
a single cycle sees energy taken by the working body from the hot reservoir and sent to the two other reservoirs the work reservoir and the cold reservoir
the hot reservoir always and only supplies energy and the cold reservoir always and only receives energy
the second law of thermodynamics requires that no cycle can occur in which no energy is received by the cold reservoir
heat engines achieve higher efficiency when the ratio of the initial and final temperature is greater
another commonly considered model is the heat pump or refrigerator
again there are four bodies the working body the hot reservoir the cold reservoir and the work reservoir
a single cycle starts with the working body colder than the cold reservoir and then energy is taken in as heat by the working body from the cold reservoir
then the work reservoir does work on the working body adding more to its internal energy making it hotter than the hot reservoir
the hot working body passes heat to the hot reservoir but still remains hotter than the cold reservoir
then by allowing it to expand without passing heat to another body the working body is made colder than the cold reservoir
it can now accept heat transfer from the cold reservoir to start another cycle
the device has transported energy from a colder to a hotter reservoir but this is not regarded as by an inanimate agency rather it is regarded as by the harnessing of work
this is because work is supplied from the work reservoir not just by a simple thermodynamic process but by a cycle of thermodynamic operations and processes which may be regarded as directed by an animate or harnessing agency
accordingly the cycle is still in accord with the second law of thermodynamics
the efficiency of a heat pump which exceeds unity is best when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is least
functionally such engines are used in two ways distinguishing a target reservoir and a resource or surrounding reservoir
a heat pump transfers heat to the hot reservoir as the target from the resource or surrounding reservoir
a refrigerator transfers heat from the cold reservoir as the target to the resource or surrounding reservoir
the target reservoir may be regarded as leaking when the target leaks heat to the surroundings heat pumping is used when the target leaks coldness to the surroundings refrigeration is used
the engines harness work to overcome the leaks
according to planck there are three main conceptual approaches to heat
one is the microscopic or kinetic theory approach
the other two are macroscopic approaches
one is the approach through the law of conservation of energy taken as prior to thermodynamics with a mechanical analysis of processes for example in the work of helmholtz
this mechanical view is taken in this article as currently customary for thermodynamic theory
the other macroscopic approach is the thermodynamic one which admits heat as a primitive concept which contributes by scientific induction to knowledge of the law of conservation of energy
this view is widely taken as the practical one quantity of heat being measured by calorimetry
bailyn also distinguishes the two macroscopic approaches as the mechanical and the thermodynamic
the thermodynamic view was taken by the founders of thermodynamics in the nineteenth century
it regards quantity of energy transferred as heat as a primitive concept coherent with a primitive concept of temperature measured primarily by calorimetry
a calorimeter is a body in the surroundings of the system with its own temperature and internal energy when it is connected to the system by a path for heat transfer changes in it measure heat transfer
the mechanical view was pioneered by helmholtz and developed and used in the twentieth century largely through the influence of max born
it regards quantity of heat transferred as heat as a derived concept defined for closed systems as quantity of heat transferred by mechanisms other than work transfer the latter being regarded as primitive for thermodynamics defined by macroscopic mechanics
according to born the transfer of internal energy between open systems that accompanies transfer of matter cannot be reduced to mechanics
it follows that there is no well founded definition of quantities of energy transferred as heat or as work associated with transfer of matter
nevertheless for the thermodynamical description of non equilibrium processes it is desired to consider the effect of a temperature gradient established by the surroundings across the system of interest when there is no physical barrier or wall between system and surroundings that is to say when they are open with respect to one another
the impossibility of a mechanical definition in terms of work for this circumstance does not alter the physical fact that a temperature gradient causes a diffusive flux of internal energy a process that in the thermodynamic view might be proposed as a candidate concept for transfer of energy as heat
in this circumstance it may be expected that there may also be active other drivers of diffusive flux of internal energy such as gradient of chemical potential which drives transfer of matter and gradient of electric potential which drives electric current and iontophoresis such effects usually interact with diffusive flux of internal energy driven by temperature gradient and such interactions are known as cross effects
if cross effects that result in diffusive transfer of internal energy were also labeled as heat transfers they would sometimes violate the rule that pure heat transfer occurs only down a temperature gradient never up one
they would also contradict the principle that all heat transfer is of one and the same kind a principle founded on the idea of heat conduction between closed systems
one might to try to think narrowly of heat flux driven purely by temperature gradient as a conceptual component of diffusive internal energy flux in the thermodynamic view the concept resting specifically on careful calculations based on detailed knowledge of the processes and being indirectly assessed
in these circumstances if perchance it happens that no transfer of matter is actualized and there are no cross effects then the thermodynamic concept and the mechanical concept coincide as if one were dealing with closed systems
but when there is transfer of matter the exact laws by which temperature gradient drives diffusive flux of internal energy rather than being exactly knowable mostly need to be assumed and in many cases are practically unverifiable
consequently when there is transfer of matter the calculation of the pure heat flux component of the diffusive flux of internal energy rests on practically unverifiable assumptions
this is a reason to think of heat as a specialized concept that relates primarily and precisely to closed systems and applicable only in a very restricted way to open systems
in many writings in this context the term heat flux is used when what is meant is therefore more accurately called diffusive flux of internal energy such usage of the term heat flux is a residue of older and now obsolete language usage that allowed that a body may have a heat content
in the kinetic theory heat is explained in terms of the microscopic motions and interactions of constituent particles such as electrons atoms and molecules
the immediate meaning of the kinetic energy of the constituent particles is not as heat
it is as a component of internal energy
in microscopic terms heat is a transfer quantity and is described by a transport theory not as steadily localized kinetic energy of particles
heat transfer arises from temperature gradients or differences through the diffuse exchange of microscopic kinetic and potential particle energy by particle collisions and other interactions
an early and vague expression of this was made by francis bacon
precise and detailed versions of it were developed in the nineteenth century
in statistical mechanics for a closed system no transfer of matter heat is the energy transfer associated with a disordered microscopic action on the system associated with jumps in occupation numbers of the energy levels of the system without change in the values of the energy levels themselves
it is possible for macroscopic thermodynamic work to alter the occupation numbers without change in the values of the system energy levels themselves but what distinguishes transfer as heat is that the transfer is entirely due to disordered microscopic action including radiative transfer
a mathematical definition can be formulated for small increments of quasi static adiabatic work in terms of the statistical distribution of an ensemble of microstates
quantity of heat transferred can be measured by calorimetry or determined through calculations based on other quantities
calorimetry is the empirical basis of the idea of quantity of heat transferred in a process
the transferred heat is measured by changes in a body of known properties for example temperature rise change in volume or length or phase change such as melting of ice
a calculation of quantity of heat transferred can rely on a hypothetical quantity of energy transferred as adiabatic work and on the first law of thermodynamics
such calculation is the primary approach of many theoretical studies of quantity of heat transferred
the discipline of heat transfer typically considered an aspect of mechanical engineering and chemical engineering deals with specific applied methods by which thermal energy in a system is generated or converted or transferred to another system
although the definition of heat implicitly means the transfer of energy the term heat transfer encompasses this traditional usage in many engineering disciplines and laymen language
heat transfer is generally described as including the mechanisms of heat conduction heat convection thermal radiation but may include mass transfer and heat in processes of phase changes
convection may be described as the combined effects of conduction and fluid flow
from the thermodynamic point of view heat flows into a fluid by diffusion to increase its energy the fluid then transfers advects this increased internal energy not heat from one location to another and this is then followed by a second thermal interaction which transfers heat to a second body or system again by diffusion
this entire process is often regarded as an additional mechanism of heat transfer although technically heat transfer and thus heating and cooling occurs only on either end of such a conductive flow but not as a result of flow
thus conduction can be said to transfer heat only as a net result of the process but may not do so at every time within the complicated convective process
in an lecture entitled on matter living force and heat james prescott joule characterized the terms latent heat and sensible heat as components of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles respectively
he described latent energy as the energy possessed via a distancing of particles where attraction was over a greater distance i e
a form of potential energy and the sensible heat as an energy involving the motion of particles i e
kinetic energy
latent heat is the heat released or absorbed by a chemical substance or a thermodynamic system during a change of state that occurs without a change in temperature
such a process may be a phase transition such as the melting of ice or the boiling of water
heat capacity is a measurable physical quantity equal to the ratio of the heat added to an object to the resulting temperature change
the molar heat capacity is the heat capacity per unit amount si unit mole of a pure substance and the specific heat capacity often called simply specific heat is the heat capacity per unit mass of a material
heat capacity is a physical property of a substance which means that it depends on the state and properties of the substance under consideration
the specific heats of monatomic gases such as helium are nearly constant with temperature
diatomic gases such as hydrogen display some temperature dependence and triatomic gases e g carbon dioxide still more
before the development of the laws of thermodynamics heat was measured by changes in the states of the participating bodies
some general rules with important exceptions can be stated as follows
in general most bodies expand on heating
in this circumstance heating a body at a constant volume increases the pressure it exerts on its constraining walls while heating at a constant pressure increases its volume
beyond this most substances have three ordinarily recognized states of matter solid liquid and gas
some can also exist in a plasma
many have further more finely differentiated states of matter such as glass and liquid crystal
in many cases at fixed temperature and pressure a substance can exist in several distinct states of matter in what might be viewed as the same body
for example ice may float in a glass of water
then the ice and the water are said to constitute two phases within the body
definite rules are known telling how distinct phases may coexist in a body
mostly at a fixed pressure there is a definite temperature at which heating causes a solid to melt or evaporate and a definite temperature at which heating causes a liquid to evaporate
in such cases cooling has the reverse effects
all of these the commonest cases fit with a rule that heating can be measured by changes of state of a body
such cases supply what are called thermometric bodies that allow the definition of empirical temperatures
before all temperatures were defined in this way
there was thus a tight link apparently logically determined between heat and temperature though they were recognized as conceptually thoroughly distinct especially by joseph black in the later eighteenth century
there are important exceptions
they break the obviously apparent link between heat and temperature
they make it clear that empirical definitions of temperature are contingent on the peculiar properties of particular thermometric substances and are thus precluded from the title absolute
for example water contracts on being heated near k
it cannot be used as a thermometric substance near that temperature
also over a certain temperature range ice contracts on heating
moreover many substances can exist in metastable states such as with negative pressure that survive only transiently and in very special conditions
such facts sometimes called anomalous are some of the reasons for the thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature
in the early days of measurement of high temperatures another factor was important and used by josiah wedgwood in his pyrometer
the temperature reached in a process was estimated by the shrinkage of a sample of clay
the higher the temperature the more the shrinkage
this was the only available more or less reliable method of measurement of temperatures above c f
but such shrinkage is irreversible
the clay does not expand again on cooling
that is why it could be used for the measurement
but only once
it is not a thermometric material in the usual sense of the word
nevertheless the thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature does make essential use of the concept of heat with proper circumspection
according to denbigh the property of hotness is a concern of thermodynamics that should be defined without reference to the concept of heat
consideration of hotness leads to the concept of empirical temperature
all physical systems are capable of heating or cooling others
with reference to hotness the comparative terms hotter and colder are defined by the rule that heat flows from the hotter body to the colder
if a physical system is inhomogeneous or very rapidly or irregularly changing for example by turbulence it may be impossible to characterize it by a temperature but still there can be transfer of energy as heat between it and another system
if a system has a physical state that is regular enough and persists long enough to allow it to reach thermal equilibrium with a specified thermometer then it has a temperature according to that thermometer
an empirical thermometer registers degree of hotness for such a system
such a temperature is called empirical
for example truesdell writes about classical thermodynamics at each time the body is assigned a real number called the temperature
this number is a measure of how hot the body is
physical systems that are too turbulent to have temperatures may still differ in hotness
a physical system that passes heat to another physical system is said to be the hotter of the two
more is required for the system to have a thermodynamic temperature
its behavior must be so regular that its empirical temperature is the same for all suitably calibrated and scaled thermometers and then its hotness is said to lie on the one dimensional hotness manifold
this is part of the reason why heat is defined following carath odory and born solely as occurring other than by work or transfer of matter temperature is advisedly and deliberately not mentioned in this now widely accepted definition
this is also the reason that the zeroth law of thermodynamics is stated explicitly
if three physical systems a b and c are each not in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium it is possible that with suitable physical connections being made between them a can heat b and b can heat c and c can heat a
in non equilibrium situations cycles of flow are possible
it is the special and uniquely distinguishing characteristic of internal thermodynamic equilibrium that this possibility is not open to thermodynamic systems as distinguished amongst physical systems which are in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium this is the reason why the zeroth law of thermodynamics needs explicit statement
that is to say the relation is not colder than between general non equilibrium physical systems is not transitive whereas in contrast the relation has no lower a temperature than between thermodynamic systems in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is transitive
it follows from this that the relation is in thermal equilibrium with is transitive which is one way of stating the zeroth law
just as temperature may be undefined for a sufficiently inhomogeneous system so also may entropy be undefined for a system not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium
for example the temperature of the solar system is not a defined quantity
likewise the entropy of the solar system is not defined in classical thermodynamics
it has not been possible to define non equilibrium entropy as a simple number for a whole system in a clearly satisfactory way
