information security sometimes shortened to infosec is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks
it is part of information risk management
it typically involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized inappropriate access to data or the unlawful use disclosure disruption deletion corruption modification inspection recording or devaluation of information
it also involves actions intended to reduce the adverse impacts of such incidents
protected information may take any form e g
electronic or physical tangible e g
paperwork or intangible e g
knowledge
information security s primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality integrity and availability of data also known as the cia triad while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation all without hampering organization productivity
this is largely achieved through a structured risk management process that involves
identifying information and related assets plus potential threats vulnerabilities and impacts
evaluating the risks
deciding how to address or treat the risks i e
to avoid mitigate share or accept them
where risk mitigation is required selecting or designing appropriate security controls and implementing them
monitoring the activities making adjustments as necessary to address any issues changes and improvement opportunitiesto standardize this discipline academics and professionals collaborate to offer guidance policies and industry standards on password antivirus software firewall encryption software legal liability security awareness and training and so forth
this standardization may be further driven by a wide variety of laws and regulations that affect how data is accessed processed stored transferred and destroyed
however the implementation of any standards and guidance within an entity may have limited effect if a culture of continual improvement isn t adopted
various definitions of information security are suggested below summarized from different sources
preservation of confidentiality integrity and availability of information
note in addition other properties such as authenticity accountability non repudiation and reliability can also be involved iso iec

information security is the protection of information and minimizes the risk of exposing information to unauthorized parties venter and eloff
information security is a multidisciplinary area of study and professional activity which is concerned with the development and implementation of security mechanisms of all available types technical organizational human oriented and legal in order to keep information in all its locations within and outside the organization s perimeter and consequently information systems where information is created processed stored transmitted and destroyed free from threats
threats to information and information systems may be categorized and a corresponding security goal may be defined for each category of threats
a set of security goals identified as a result of a threat analysis should be revised periodically to ensure its adequacy and conformance with the evolving environment
the currently relevant set of security goals may include confidentiality integrity availability privacy authenticity trustworthiness non repudiation accountability and auditability cherdantseva and hilton
information and information resource security using telecommunication system or devices means protecting information information systems or books from unauthorized access damage theft or destruction kurose and ross at the core of information security is information assurance the act of maintaining the confidentiality integrity and availability cia of information ensuring that information is not compromised in any way when critical issues arise
these issues include but are not limited to natural disasters computer server malfunction and physical theft
while paper based business operations are still prevalent requiring their own set of information security practices enterprise digital initiatives are increasingly being emphasized with information assurance now typically being dealt with by information technology it security specialists
these specialists apply information security to technology most often some form of computer system
it is worthwhile to note that a computer does not necessarily mean a home desktop
a computer is any device with a processor and some memory
such devices can range from non networked standalone devices as simple as calculators to networked mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablet computers
it security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise establishment due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses
they are responsible for keeping all of the technology within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to acquire critical private information or gain control of the internal systems
the field of information security has grown and evolved significantly in recent years
it offers many areas for specialization including securing networks and allied infrastructure securing applications and databases security testing information systems auditing business continuity planning electronic record discovery and digital forensics
information security professionals are very stable in their employment
as of more than percent of professionals had no change in employer or employment over a period of a year and the number of professionals is projected to continuously grow more than percent annually from to
information security threats come in many different forms
some of the most common threats today are software attacks theft of intellectual property theft of identity theft of equipment or information sabotage and information extortion
most people have experienced software attacks of some sort
viruses worms phishing attacks and trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks
the theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the information technology it field
identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person s personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information through social engineering
theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today due to the fact that most devices today are mobile are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data capacity increases
sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization s website in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers
information extortion consists of theft of a company s property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner as with ransomware
there are many ways to help protect yourself from some of these attacks but one of the most functional precautions is conduct periodical user awareness
the number one threat to any organisation are users or internal employees they are also called insider threats
governments military corporations financial institutions hospitals non profit organisations and private businesses amass a great deal of confidential information about their employees customers products research and financial status
should confidential information about a business customers or finances or new product line fall into the hands of a competitor or a black hat hacker a business and its customers could suffer widespread irreparable financial loss as well as damage to the company s reputation
from a business perspective information security must be balanced against cost the gordon loeb model provides a mathematical economic approach for addressing this concern
for the individual information security has a significant effect on privacy which is viewed very differently in various cultures
possible responses to a security threat or risk are
reduce mitigate implement safeguards and countermeasures to eliminate vulnerabilities or block threats
assign transfer place the cost of the threat onto another entity or organization such as purchasing insurance or outsourcing
accept evaluate if the cost of the countermeasure outweighs the possible cost of loss due to the threatsince the early days of communication diplomats and military commanders understood that it was necessary to provide some mechanism to protect the confidentiality of correspondence and to have some means of detecting tampering
julius caesar is credited with the invention of the caesar cipher c
b c which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands
however for the most part protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls
sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be protected and transported by trusted persons guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong box
as postal services expanded governments created official organizations to intercept decipher read and reseal letters e g the u k s secret office founded in
in the mid nineteenth century more complex classification systems were developed to allow governments to manage their information according to the degree of sensitivity
for example the british government codified this to some extent with the publication of the official secrets act in
section of the law concerned espionage and unlawful disclosures of information while section dealt with breaches of official trust
a public interest defense was soon added to defend disclosures in the interest of the state
a similar law was passed in india in the indian official secrets act which was associated with the british colonial era and used to crack down on newspapers that opposed the raj s policies
a newer version was passed in that extended to all matters of confidential or secret information for governance
by the time of the first world war multi tier classification systems were used to communicate information to and from various fronts which encouraged greater use of code making and breaking sections in diplomatic and military headquarters
encoding became more sophisticated between the wars as machines were employed to scramble and unscramble information
the establishment of computer security inaugurated the history of information security
the need for such appeared during world war ii
the volume of information shared by the allied countries during the second world war necessitated formal alignment of classification systems and procedural controls
an arcane range of markings evolved to indicate who could handle documents usually officers rather than enlisted troops and where they should be stored as increasingly complex safes and storage facilities were developed
the enigma machine which was employed by the germans to encrypt the data of warfare and was successfully decrypted by alan turing can be regarded as a striking example of creating and using secured information
procedures evolved to ensure documents were destroyed properly and it was the failure to follow these procedures which led to some of the greatest intelligence coups of the war e g the capture of u
various mainframe computers were connected online during the cold war to complete more sophisticated tasks in a communication process easier than mailing magnetic tapes back and forth by computer centers
as such the advanced research projects agency arpa of the united states department of defense started researching the feasibility of a networked system of communication to trade information within the united states armed forces
in the arpanet project was formulated by dr
larry roberts which would later evolve into what is known as the internet
in important elements of arpanet security were found by internet pioneer robert metcalfe to have many flaws such as the vulnerability of password structure and formats lack of safety procedures for dial up connections and nonexistent user identification and authorizations aside from the lack of controls and safeguards to keep data safe from unauthorized access
hackers had effortless access to arpanet as phone numbers were known by the public
due to these problems coupled with the constant violation of computer security as well as the exponential increase in the number of hosts and users of the system network security was often alluded to as network insecurity
the end of the twentieth century and the early years of the twenty first century saw rapid advancements in telecommunications computing hardware and software and data encryption
the availability of smaller more powerful and less expensive computing equipment made electronic data processing within the reach of small business and home users
the establishment of transfer control protocol internetwork protocol tcp ip in the early s enabled different types of computers to communicate
these computers quickly became interconnected through the internet
the rapid growth and widespread use of electronic data processing and electronic business conducted through the internet along with numerous occurrences of international terrorism fueled the need for better methods of protecting the computers and the information they store process and transmit
the academic disciplines of computer security and information assurance emerged along with numerous professional organizations all sharing the common goals of ensuring the security and reliability of information systems
the cia triad of confidentiality integrity and availability is at the heart of information security
the members of the classic infosec triad confidentiality integrity and availability are interchangeably referred to in the literature as security attributes properties security goals fundamental aspects information criteria critical information characteristics and basic building blocks however debate continues about whether or not this cia triad is sufficient to address rapidly changing technology and business requirements with recommendations to consider expanding on the intersections between availability and confidentiality as well as the relationship between security and privacy
other principles such as accountability have sometimes been proposed it has been pointed out that issues such as non repudiation do not fit well within the three core concepts
the triad seems to have first been mentioned in a nist publication in
in and revised in the oecd s guidelines for the security of information systems and networks proposed the nine generally accepted principles awareness responsibility response ethics democracy risk assessment security design and implementation security management and reassessment
building upon those in the nist s engineering principles for information technology security proposed principles
from each of these derived guidelines and practices
in donn parker proposed an alternative model for the classic cia triad that he called the six atomic elements of information
the elements are confidentiality possession integrity authenticity availability and utility
the merits of the parkerian hexad are a subject of debate amongst security professionals
in the open group published the information security management standard o ism
this standard proposed an operational definition of the key concepts of security with elements called security objectives related to access control availability data quality compliance and technical
in dod software protection initiative archived at the wayback machine released the three tenets of cybersecurity archived at the wayback machine which are system susceptibility access to the flaw and capability to exploit the flaw
neither of these models are widely adopted
in information security confidentiality is the property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals entities or processes
while similar to privacy the two words are not interchangeable
rather confidentiality is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers
examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft password theft or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals
in it security data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle
this means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner
this is not the same thing as referential integrity in databases although it can be viewed as a special case of consistency as understood in the classic acid model of transaction processing
information security systems typically incorporate controls to ensure their own integrity in particular protecting the kernel or core functions against both deliberate and accidental threats
multi purpose and multi user computer systems aim to compartmentalize the data and processing such that no user or process can adversely impact another the controls may not succeed however as we see in incidents such as malware infections hacks data theft fraud and privacy breaches
more broadly integrity is an information security principle that involves human social process and commercial integrity as well as data integrity
as such it touches on aspects such as credibility consistency truthfulness completeness accuracy timeliness and assurance
for any information system to serve its purpose the information must be available when it is needed
this means the computing systems used to store and process the information the security controls used to protect it and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly
high availability systems aim to remain available at all times preventing service disruptions due to power outages hardware failures and system upgrades
ensuring availability also involves preventing denial of service attacks such as a flood of incoming messages to the target system essentially forcing it to shut down
in the realm of information security availability can often be viewed as one of the most important parts of a successful information security program
ultimately end users need to be able to perform job functions by ensuring availability an organization is able to perform to the standards that an organization s stakeholders expect
this can involve topics such as proxy configurations outside web access the ability to access shared drives and the ability to send emails
executives oftentimes do not understand the technical side of information security and look at availability as an easy fix but this often requires collaboration from many different organizational teams such as network operations development operations incident response and policy change management
a successful information security team involves many different key roles to mesh and align for the cia triad to be provided effectively
in law non repudiation implies one s intention to fulfill their obligations to a contract
it also implies that one party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction nor can the other party deny having sent a transaction
it is important to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non repudiation efforts the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology
it is not for instance sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender s private key and thus only the sender could have sent the message and nobody else could have altered it in transit data integrity
the alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised
the fault for these violations may or may not lie with the sender and such assertions may or may not relieve the sender of liability but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity
as such the sender may repudiate the message because authenticity and integrity are pre requisites for non repudiation
broadly speaking risk is the likelihood that something bad will happen that causes harm to an informational asset or the loss of the asset
a vulnerability is a weakness that could be used to endanger or cause harm to an informational asset
a threat is anything man made or act of nature that has the potential to cause harm
the likelihood that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause harm creates a risk
when a threat does use a vulnerability to inflict harm it has an impact
in the context of information security the impact is a loss of availability integrity and confidentiality and possibly other losses lost income loss of life loss of real property
the certified information systems auditor cisa review manual defines risk management as the process of identifying vulnerabilities and threats to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives and deciding what countermeasures if any to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level based on the value of the information resource to the organization
there are two things in this definition that may need some clarification
first the process of risk management is an ongoing iterative process
it must be repeated indefinitely
the business environment is constantly changing and new threats and vulnerabilities emerge every day
second the choice of countermeasures controls used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity cost effectiveness of the countermeasure and the value of the informational asset being protected
furthermore these processes have limitations as security breaches are generally rare and emerge in a specific context which may not be easily duplicated
thus any process and countermeasure should itself be evaluated for vulnerabilities
it is not possible to identify all risks nor is it possible to eliminate all risk
the remaining risk is called residual risk
a risk assessment is carried out by a team of people who have knowledge of specific areas of the business
membership of the team may vary over time as different parts of the business are assessed
the assessment may use a subjective qualitative analysis based on informed opinion or where reliable dollar figures and historical information is available the analysis may use quantitative analysis
research has shown that the most vulnerable point in most information systems is the human user operator designer or other human
the iso iec code of practice for information security management recommends the following be examined during a risk assessment
security policy
organization of information security
asset management
human resources security
physical and environmental security
communications and operations management
access control
information systems acquisition development and maintenance
information security incident management
business continuity management
regulatory compliance in broad terms the risk management process consists of
identification of assets and estimating their value
include people buildings hardware software data electronic print other supplies
conduct a threat assessment
include acts of nature acts of war accidents malicious acts originating from inside or outside the organization
conduct a vulnerability assessment and for each vulnerability calculate the probability that it will be exploited
evaluate policies procedures standards training physical security quality control technical security
calculate the impact that each threat would have on each asset
use qualitative analysis or quantitative analysis
identify select and implement appropriate controls
provide a proportional response
consider productivity cost effectiveness and value of the asset
evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures
ensure the controls provide the required cost effective protection without discernible loss of productivity for any given risk management can choose to accept the risk based upon the relative low value of the asset the relative low frequency of occurrence and the relative low impact on the business
or leadership may choose to mitigate the risk by selecting and implementing appropriate control measures to reduce the risk
in some cases the risk can be transferred to another business by buying insurance or outsourcing to another business
the reality of some risks may be disputed
in such cases leadership may choose to deny the risk
selecting and implementing proper security controls will initially help an organization bring down risk to acceptable levels
control selection should follow and should be based on the risk assessment
controls can vary in nature but fundamentally they are ways of protecting the confidentiality integrity or availability of information
iso iec has defined controls in different areas
organizations can implement additional controls according to requirement of the organization
iso iec offers a guideline for organizational information security standards
administrative controls also called procedural controls consist of approved written policies procedures standards and guidelines
administrative controls form the framework for running the business and managing people
they inform people on how the business is to be run and how day to day operations are to be conducted
laws and regulations created by government bodies are also a type of administrative control because they inform the business
some industry sectors have policies procedures standards and guidelines that must be followed the payment card industry data security standard pci dss required by visa and mastercard is such an example
other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy password policy hiring policies and disciplinary policies
administrative controls form the basis for the selection and implementation of logical and physical controls
logical and physical controls are manifestations of administrative controls which are of paramount importance
logical controls also called technical controls use software and data to monitor and control access to information and computing systems
passwords network and host based firewalls network intrusion detection systems access control lists and data encryption are examples of logical controls
an important logical control that is frequently overlooked is the principle of least privilege which requires that an individual program or system process not be granted any more access privileges than are necessary to perform the task
a blatant example of the failure to adhere to the principle of least privilege is logging into windows as user administrator to read email and surf the web
violations of this principle can also occur when an individual collects additional access privileges over time
this happens when employees job duties change employees are promoted to a new position or employees are transferred to another department
the access privileges required by their new duties are frequently added onto their already existing access privileges which may no longer be necessary or appropriate
physical controls monitor and control the environment of the work place and computing facilities
they also monitor and control access to and from such facilities and include doors locks heating and air conditioning smoke and fire alarms fire suppression systems cameras barricades fencing security guards cable locks etc
separating the network and workplace into functional areas are also physical controls
an important physical control that is frequently overlooked is separation of duties which ensures that an individual can not complete a critical task by himself
for example an employee who submits a request for reimbursement should not also be able to authorize payment or print the check
an applications programmer should not also be the server administrator or the database administrator these roles and responsibilities must be separated from one another
information security must protect information throughout its lifespan from the initial creation of the information on through to the final disposal of the information
the information must be protected while in motion and while at rest
during its lifetime information may pass through many different information processing systems and through many different parts of information processing systems
there are many different ways the information and information systems can be threatened
to fully protect the information during its lifetime each component of the information processing system must have its own protection mechanisms
the building up layering on and overlapping of security measures is called defense in depth in contrast to a metal chain which is famously only as strong as its weakest link the defense in depth strategy aims at a structure where should one defensive measure fail other measures will continue to provide protection
recall the earlier discussion about administrative controls logical controls and physical controls
the three types of controls can be used to form the basis upon which to build a defense in depth strategy
with this approach defense in depth can be conceptualized as three distinct layers or planes laid one on top of the other
additional insight into defense in depth can be gained by thinking of it as forming the layers of an onion with data at the core of the onion people the next outer layer of the onion and network security host based security and application security forming the outermost layers of the onion
both perspectives are equally valid and each provides valuable insight into the implementation of a good defense in depth strategy
an important aspect of information security and risk management is recognizing the value of information and defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements for the information
not all information is equal and so not all information requires the same degree of protection
this requires information to be assigned a security classification
the first step in information classification is to identify a member of senior management as the owner of the particular information to be classified
next develop a classification policy
the policy should describe the different classification labels define the criteria for information to be assigned a particular label and list the required security controls for each classification
some factors that influence which classification information should be assigned include how much value that information has to the organization how old the information is and whether or not the information has become obsolete
laws and other regulatory requirements are also important considerations when classifying information
the information systems audit and control association isaca and its business model for information security also serves as a tool for security professionals to examine security from a systems perspective creating an environment where security can be managed holistically allowing actual risks to be addressed
the type of information security classification labels selected and used will depend on the nature of the organization with examples being
in the business sector labels such as public sensitive private confidential
in the government sector labels such as unclassified unofficial protected confidential secret top secret and their non english equivalents
in cross sectoral formations the traffic light protocol which consists of white green amber and red all employees in the organization as well as business partners must be trained on the classification schema and understand the required security controls and handling procedures for each classification
the classification of a particular information asset that has been assigned should be reviewed periodically to ensure the classification is still appropriate for the information and to ensure the security controls required by the classification are in place and are followed in their right procedures
access to protected information must be restricted to people who are authorized to access the information
the computer programs and in many cases the computers that process the information must also be authorized
this requires that mechanisms be in place to control the access to protected information
the sophistication of the access control mechanisms should be in parity with the value of the information being protected the more sensitive or valuable the information the stronger the control mechanisms need to be
the foundation on which access control mechanisms are built start with identification and authentication
access control is generally considered in three steps identification authentication and authorization
identification is an assertion of who someone is or what something is
if a person makes the statement hello my name is john doe they are making a claim of who they are
however their claim may or may not be true
before john doe can be granted access to protected information it will be necessary to verify that the person claiming to be john doe really is john doe
typically the claim is in the form of a username
by entering that username you are claiming i am the person the username belongs to
authentication is the act of verifying a claim of identity
when john doe goes into a bank to make a withdrawal he tells the bank teller he is john doe a claim of identity
the bank teller asks to see a photo id so he hands the teller his driver s license
the bank teller checks the license to make sure it has john doe printed on it and compares the photograph on the license against the person claiming to be john doe
if the photo and name match the person then the teller has authenticated that john doe is who he claimed to be
similarly by entering the correct password the user is providing evidence that he she is the person the username belongs to
there are three different types of information that can be used for authentication
something you know things such as a pin a password or your mother s maiden name
something you have a driver s license or a magnetic swipe card
something you are biometrics including palm prints fingerprints voice prints and retina eye scansstrong authentication requires providing more than one type of authentication information two factor authentication
the username is the most common form of identification on computer systems today and the password is the most common form of authentication
usernames and passwords have served their purpose but they are increasingly inadequate
usernames and passwords are slowly being replaced or supplemented with more sophisticated authentication mechanisms such as time based one time password algorithms
after a person program or computer has successfully been identified and authenticated then it must be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they will be allowed to perform run view create delete or change
this is called authorization
authorization to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and procedures
the policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed by whom and under what conditions
the access control mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies
different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control mechanisms
some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms
the access control mechanism a system offers will be based upon one of three approaches to access control or it may be derived from a combination of the three approaches
the non discretionary approach consolidates all access control under a centralized administration
the access to information and other resources is usually based on the individuals function role in the organization or the tasks the individual must perform
the discretionary approach gives the creator or owner of the information resource the ability to control access to those resources
in the mandatory access control approach access is granted or denied basing upon the security classification assigned to the information resource
examples of common access control mechanisms in use today include role based access control available in many advanced database management systems simple file permissions provided in the unix and windows operating systems group policy objects provided in windows network systems and kerberos radius tacacs and the simple access lists used in many firewalls and routers
to be effective policies and other security controls must be enforceable and upheld
effective policies ensure that people are held accountable for their actions
the u s
treasury s guidelines for systems processing sensitive or proprietary information for example states that all failed and successful authentication and access attempts must be logged and all access to information must leave some type of audit trail
also the need to know principle needs to be in effect when talking about access control
this principle gives access rights to a person to perform their job functions
this principle is used in the government when dealing with difference clearances
even though two employees in different departments have a top secret clearance they must have a need to know in order for information to be exchanged
within the need to know principle network administrators grant the employee the least amount of privilege to prevent employees from accessing more than what they are supposed to
need to know helps to enforce the confidentiality integrity availability triad
need to know directly impacts the confidential area of the triad
information security uses cryptography to transform usable information into a form that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorized user this process is called encryption
information that has been encrypted rendered unusable can be transformed back into its original usable form by an authorized user who possesses the cryptographic key through the process of decryption
cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure while the information is in transit either electronically or physically and while information is in storage
cryptography provides information security with other useful applications as well including improved authentication methods message digests digital signatures non repudiation and encrypted network communications
older less secure applications such as telnet and file transfer protocol ftp are slowly being replaced with more secure applications such as secure shell ssh that use encrypted network communications
wireless communications can be encrypted using protocols such as wpa wpa or the older and less secure wep
wired communications such as itu t g hn are secured using aes for encryption and x for authentication and key exchange
software applications such as gnupg or pgp can be used to encrypt data files and email
cryptography can introduce security problems when it is not implemented correctly
cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography
the length and strength of the encryption key is also an important consideration
a key that is weak or too short will produce weak encryption
the keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information
they must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and destruction and they must be available when needed
public key infrastructure pki solutions address many of the problems that surround key management
the terms reasonable and prudent person due care and due diligence have been used in the fields of finance securities and law for many years
in recent years these terms have found their way into the fields of computing and information security
federal sentencing guidelines now make it possible to hold corporate officers liable for failing to exercise due care and due diligence in the management of their information systems
in the business world stockholders customers business partners and governments have the expectation that corporate officers will run the business in accordance with accepted business practices and in compliance with laws and other regulatory requirements
this is often described as the reasonable and prudent person rule
a prudent person takes due care to ensure that everything necessary is done to operate the business by sound business principles and in a legal ethical manner
a prudent person is also diligent mindful attentive ongoing in their due care of the business
in the field of information security harris
offers the following definitions of due care and due diligence
due care are steps that are taken to show that a company has taken responsibility for the activities that take place within the corporation and has taken the necessary steps to help protect the company its resources and employees and due diligence are the continual activities that make sure the protection mechanisms are continually maintained and operational
attention should be made to two important points in these definitions
first in due care steps are taken to show this means that the steps can be verified measured or even produce tangible artifacts
second in due diligence there are continual activities this means that people are actually doing things to monitor and maintain the protection mechanisms and these activities are ongoing
organizations have a responsibility with practicing duty of care when applying information security
the duty of care risk analysis standard docra provides principles and practices for evaluating risk
it considers all parties that could be affected by those risks
docra helps evaluate safeguards if they are appropriate in protecting others from harm while presenting a reasonable burden
with increased data breach litigation companies must balance security controls compliance and its mission
the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university in a publication titled governing for enterprise security ges implementation guide defines characteristics of effective security governance
these include
an enterprise wide issue
leaders are accountable
viewed as a business requirement
risk based
roles responsibilities and segregation of duties defined
addressed and enforced in policy
adequate resources committed
staff aware and trained
a development life cycle requirement
planned managed measurable and measured
reviewed and auditedan incident response plan irp is a group of policies that dictate an organizations reaction to a cyber attack
once an security breach has been identified the plan is initiated
it is important to note that there can be legal implications to a data breach
knowing local and federal laws is critical
every plan is unique to the needs of the organization and it can involve skill sets that are not part of an it team
for example a lawyer may be included in the response plan to help navigate legal implications to a data breach
as mentioned above every plan is unique but most plans will include the following
good preparation includes the development of an incident response team irt
skills need to be used by this team would be penetration testing computer forensics network security etc
this team should also keep track of trends in cybersecurity and modern attack strategies
a training program for end users is important as well as most modern attack strategies target users on the network
this part of the incident response plan identifies if there was a security event
when an end user reports information or an admin notices irregularities an investigation is launched
an incident log is a crucial part of this step
all of the members of the team should be updating this log to ensure that information flows as fast as possible
if it has been identified that a security breach has occurred the next step should be activated
in this phase the irt works to isolate the areas that the breach took place to limit the scope of the security event
during this phase it is important to preserve information forensically so it can be analyzed later in the process
containment could be as simple as physically containing a server room or as complex as segmenting a network to not allow the spread of a virus
this is where the threat that was identified is removed from the affected systems
this could include deleting malicious files terminating compromised accounts or deleting other components
some events do not require this step however it is important to fully understand the event before moving to this step
this will help to ensure that the threat is completely removed
this stage is where the systems are restored back to original operation
this stage could include the recovery of data changing user access information or updating firewall rules or policies to prevent a breach in the future
without executing this step the system could still be vulnerable to future security threats
in this step information that has been gathered during this process is used to make future decisions on security
this step is crucial to the ensure that future events are prevented
using this information to further train admins is critical to the process
this step can also be used to process information that is distributed from other entities who have experienced a security event
change management is a formal process for directing and controlling alterations to the information processing environment
this includes alterations to desktop computers the network servers and software
the objectives of change management are to reduce the risks posed by changes to the information processing environment and improve the stability and reliability of the processing environment as changes are made
it is not the objective of change management to prevent or hinder necessary changes from being implemented
any change to the information processing environment introduces an element of risk
even apparently simple changes can have unexpected effects
one of management s many responsibilities is the management of risk
change management is a tool for managing the risks introduced by changes to the information processing environment
part of the change management process ensures that changes are not implemented at inopportune times when they may disrupt critical business processes or interfere with other changes being implemented
not every change needs to be managed
some kinds of changes are a part of the everyday routine of information processing and adhere to a predefined procedure which reduces the overall level of risk to the processing environment
creating a new user account or deploying a new desktop computer are examples of changes that do not generally require change management
however relocating user file shares or upgrading the email server pose a much higher level of risk to the processing environment and are not a normal everyday activity
the critical first steps in change management are a defining change and communicating that definition and b defining the scope of the change system
change management is usually overseen by a change review board composed of representatives from key business areas security networking systems administrators database administration application developers desktop support and the help desk
the tasks of the change review board can be facilitated with the use of automated work flow application
the responsibility of the change review board is to ensure the organization s documented change management procedures are followed
the change management process is as follows
request anyone can request a change
the person making the change request may or may not be the same person that performs the analysis or implements the change
when a request for change is received it may undergo a preliminary review to determine if the requested change is compatible with the organizations business model and practices and to determine the amount of resources needed to implement the change
approve management runs the business and controls the allocation of resources therefore management must approve requests for changes and assign a priority for every change
management might choose to reject a change request if the change is not compatible with the business model industry standards or best practices
management might also choose to reject a change request if the change requires more resources than can be allocated for the change
plan planning a change involves discovering the scope and impact of the proposed change analyzing the complexity of the change allocation of resources and developing testing and documenting both implementation and back out plans
need to define the criteria on which a decision to back out will be made
test every change must be tested in a safe test environment which closely reflects the actual production environment before the change is applied to the production environment
the backout plan must also be tested
schedule part of the change review board s responsibility is to assist in the scheduling of changes by reviewing the proposed implementation date for potential conflicts with other scheduled changes or critical business activities
communicate once a change has been scheduled it must be communicated
the communication is to give others the opportunity to remind the change review board about other changes or critical business activities that might have been overlooked when scheduling the change
the communication also serves to make the help desk and users aware that a change is about to occur
another responsibility of the change review board is to ensure that scheduled changes have been properly communicated to those who will be affected by the change or otherwise have an interest in the change
implement at the appointed date and time the changes must be implemented
part of the planning process was to develop an implementation plan testing plan and a back out plan
if the implementation of the change should fail or the post implementation testing fails or other drop dead criteria have been met the back out plan should be implemented
document all changes must be documented
the documentation includes the initial request for change its approval the priority assigned to it the implementation testing and back out plans the results of the change review board critique the date time the change was implemented who implemented it and whether the change was implemented successfully failed or postponed
post change review the change review board should hold a post implementation review of changes
it is particularly important to review failed and backed out changes
the review board should try to understand the problems that were encountered and look for areas for improvement change management procedures that are simple to follow and easy to use can greatly reduce the overall risks created when changes are made to the information processing environment
good change management procedures improve the overall quality and success of changes as they are implemented
this is accomplished through planning peer review documentation and communication

analysis of requirements e g identifying critical business functions dependencies and potential failure points potential threats and hence incidents or risks of concern to the organization
specification e g maximum tolerable outage periods recovery point objectives maximum acceptable periods of data loss
architecture and design e g an appropriate combination of approaches including resilience e g
engineering it systems and processes for high availability avoiding or preventing situations that might interrupt the business incident and emergency management e g evacuating premises calling the emergency services triage situation assessment and invoking recovery plans recovery e g rebuilding and contingency management generic capabilities to deal positively with whatever occurs using whatever resources are available
implementation e g configuring and scheduling backups data transfers etc duplicating and strengthening critical elements contracting with service and equipment suppliers
testing e g business continuity exercises of various types costs and assurance levels
management e g defining strategies setting objectives and goals planning and directing the work allocating funds people and other resources prioritization relative to other activities team building leadership control motivation and coordination with other business functions and activities e g it facilities human resources risk management information risk and security operations monitoring the situation checking and updating the arrangements when things change maturing the approach through continuous improvement learning and appropriate investment
assurance e g testing against specified requirements measuring analyzing and reporting key parameters conducting additional tests reviews and audits for greater confidence that the arrangements will go to plan if invoked whereas bcm takes a broad approach to minimizing disaster related risks by reducing both the probability and the severity of incidents a disaster recovery plan drp focuses specifically on resuming business operations as quickly as possible after a disaster
a disaster recovery plan invoked soon after a disaster occurs lays out the steps necessary to recover critical information and communications technology ict infrastructure
disaster recovery planning includes establishing a planning group performing risk assessment establishing priorities developing recovery strategies preparing inventories and documentation of the plan developing verification criteria and procedure and lastly implementing the plan
