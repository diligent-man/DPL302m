information security confidentiality property information made available disclosed unauthorized individual entity processes
rather confidentiality component privacy implement protect data unauthorized viewers
example confidentiality electronic data compromised include laptop theft password theft sensitive email sent incorrect individuals
security data integrity mean maintaining assuring accuracy completeness data entire lifecycle
thing referential integrity database although viewed special case consistency understood classic acid model transaction processing
information security system typically incorporate control ensure integrity particular protecting kernel core function deliberate accidental threats
multi-purpose multi-user computer system aim compartmentalize data processing user process adversely impact another control may succeed however see incident malware infection hack data theft fraud privacy breaches
broadly integrity information security principle involves humansocial process commercial integrity well data integrity
touch aspect credibility consistency truthfulness completeness accuracy timeliness assurance
information system serve purpose information must available needed
mean computing system used store process information security control used protect communication channel used access must functioning correctly
high availability system aim remain available time preventing service disruption due power outage hardware failure system upgrades
ensuring availability also involves preventing denial-of-service attack flood incoming message target system essentially forcing shut down

isoiec code practice information security management recommends following examined risk assessment
regulatory compliancein broad term risk management process consists of
include people building hardware software data electronic print supplies
include act nature act war accident malicious act originating inside outside organization
evaluate policy procedure standard training physical security quality control technical security
ensure control provide required cost effective protection without discernible loss productivityfor given risk management choose accept risk based upon relative low value asset relative low frequency occurrence relative low impact business
leadership may choose mitigate risk selecting implementing appropriate control measure reduce risk
case risk transferred another business buying insurance outsourcing another business
selecting implementing proper security control initially help organization bring risk acceptable levels
control vary nature fundamentally way protecting confidentiality integrity availability information
administrative control also called procedural control consist approved written policy procedure standard guidelines
administrative control form framework running business managing people
law regulation created government body also type administrative control inform business
industry sector policy procedure standard guideline must followed payment card industry data security standard pci ds required visa mastercard example
example administrative control include corporate security policy password policy hiring policy disciplinary policies
administrative control form basis selection implementation logical physical controls
logical physical control manifestation administrative control paramount importance
logical control also called technical control use software data monitor control access information computing systems
password network host-based firewall network intrusion detection system access control list data encryption example logical controls
important logical control frequently overlooked principle least privilege requires individual program system process granted access privilege necessary perform task
blatant example failure adhere principle least privilege logging window user administrator read email surf web
violation principle also occur individual collect additional access privilege time
happens employees' job duty change employee promoted new position employee transferred another department
access privilege required new duty frequently added onto already existing access privilege may longer necessary appropriate
physical control monitor control environment work place computing facilities
also monitor control access facility include door lock heating air conditioning smoke fire alarm fire suppression system camera barricade fencing security guard cable lock etc
separating network workplace functional area also physical controls
important physical control frequently overlooked separation duty ensures individual complete critical task himself
example employee submits request reimbursement also able authorize payment print check
application programmer also server administrator database administrator role responsibility must separated one another
information security must protect information throughout lifespan initial creation information final disposal information
lifetime information may pas many different information processing system many different part information processing systems
fully protect information lifetime component information processing system must protection mechanisms
building layering overlapping security measure called defense depth contrast metal chain famously strong weakest link defense depth strategy aim structure one defensive measure fail measure continue provide protection

approach defense depth conceptualized three distinct layer plane laid one top other
additional insight defense depth gained thinking forming layer onion data core onion people next outer layer onion network security host-based security application security forming outermost layer onion
perspective equally valid provides valuable insight implementation good defense depth strategy
important aspect information security risk management recognizing value information defining appropriate procedure protection requirement information
first step information classification identify member senior management owner particular information classified
policy describe different classification label define criterion information assigned particular label list required security control classification

cross-sectoral formation traffic light protocol consists white green amber redall employee organization well business partner must trained classification schema understand required security control handling procedure classification
classification particular information asset ha assigned reviewed periodically ensure classification still appropriate information ensure security control required classification place followed right procedures
access protected information must restricted people authorized access information
computer program many case computer process information must also authorized
sophistication access control mechanism parity value information protected sensitive valuable information stronger control mechanism need be
foundation access control mechanism built start identification authentication
access control generally considered three step identification authentication authorization
person make statement hello name john doe making claim are
john doe granted access protected information necessary verify person claiming john doe really john doe
john doe go bank make withdrawal tell bank teller john doe claim identity
bank teller asks see photo id hand teller driver's license
bank teller check license make sure ha john doe printed compare photograph license person claiming john doe
photo name match person teller ha authenticated john doe claimed be

person program computer ha successfully identified authenticated must determined informational resource permitted access action allowed perform run view create delete change
authorization access information computing service begin administrative policy procedures
different computing system equipped different kind access control mechanisms
may even offer choice different access control mechanisms
access control mechanism system offer based upon one three approach access control may derived combination three approaches
access information resource usually based individual function role organization task individual must perform
discretionary approach give creator owner information resource ability control access resources
mandatory access control approach access granted denied basing upon security classification assigned information resource
example common access control mechanism use today include role-based access control available many advanced database management system simple file permission provided unix window operating system group policy object provided window network system kerberos radius tacacs simple access list used many
treasury's guideline system processing sensitive proprietary information example state failed successful authentication access attempt must logged access information must leave type audit trail
