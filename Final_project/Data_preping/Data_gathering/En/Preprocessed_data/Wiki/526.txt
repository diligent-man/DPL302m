speothos is a genus of canid found in central and south america
the genus includes the living bush dog speothos venaticus and an extinct pleistocene species speothos pacivorus
unusually the fossil species was identified and named before the extant species was discovered with the result that the type species of speothos is s
pacivorus
pacivorus had a larger overall body size and a double rooted second lower molar
it has been proposed that speothos originated in the brazilian highlands sometime during the pleistocene
the paleobiogeography and evolutionary relationships of speothos and other south american canids is unclear
morphological data suggest that speothos is most closely related to another small canid atelocynus short eared dog
the skulls of both speothos and atelocynus have short nasals that terminate rostral to the maxillary frontal suture a character shared with vulpes fox genus
speothos and atelocynus also possess very small frontal sinuses that are minimally expanded
recent analyses of molecular mtdna data alone and in combination with morphological data support a sister taxon relationship between speothos and chrysocyon maned wolf it has been suggested that these highly derived canids diverged at least million years ago invading south america as separate lineages
speothos is distinctive in that it shares similar hypercarnivorous modifications of the dentition with cuon dhole and lycaon african wild dog
the crushing role of the post carnassial molars is reduced
the lower carnassial m of speothos lacks the entoconid creating a trenchant cutting heel on the tooth
the hypoconid on the heel talonid of the m fits into a basin in the m when the teeth are in occlusion
speothos and cuon exhibit reduction in both number and size of the post carnassial molars
