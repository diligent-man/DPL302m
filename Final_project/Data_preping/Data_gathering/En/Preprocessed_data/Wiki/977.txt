brussels belgium is considered the de facto capital of the european union having a long history of hosting a number of principal eu institutions within its european quarter
the eu has no official capital and no plan to declare one but brussels hosts the official seats of the european commission council of the european union and european council as well as a seat officially the second seat but de facto the most important one of the european parliament
in this presence generated about million euros of the regional gdp and jobs of the regional employment
the main rationale for brussels being chosen as capital the european union was its halfway location between france and germany the two countries whose rivalry led to the two world wars and whose reconciliation paved the way for european integration
in the leaders of six european countries belgium luxembourg the netherlands france italy and west germany signed the treaty of paris which created the european coal and steel community ecsc and with this new community came the first institutions the high authority council of ministers court of justice and common assembly
a number of cities were considered and brussels would have been accepted as a compromise but the belgian government put all its effort into backing li ge opposed by all the other members and was unable to formally back brussels due to internal instability
agreement remained elusive and a seat had to be found before the institutions could begin work hence luxembourg was chosen as a provisional seat though with the common assembly in strasbourg as that was the only city with a large enough hemicycle the one used by the council of europe
this agreement was temporary and plans were set to relocate the institutions to saarbr cken which would serve as a european district but this did not occur
the treaties of rome established two new communities the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom
these shared the assembly and court of the ecsc but created two new sets of councils and commissions equivalent to the ecsc s high authority
discussions on the seats of the institutions were left till the last moment before the treaties came into force so as not to interfere with ratification
brussels waited until only a month before talks to enter its application which received unofficial backing by several member states
the members agreed in principle to locate the executives councils and the assembly in one city though could still not decide which city so they put the decision off for six months
in the meantime the assembly would stay in strasbourg and the new commissions would meet alternatively at the ecsc seat and at the ch teau of val duchesse in brussels headquarters of a temporary committee
the councils would meet wherever their presidents wanted to
in practice this was the castle in brussels until autumn when it moved to central brussels at rue ravenstein ravensteinstraat
brussels missed out in its bid for a single seat due to a weak campaign from the government in negotiations despite widespread support from the people
the belgian government eventually pushed its campaign and started large scale construction renting office space in the east of the city for use by the institutions
on february the six governments concluded an unofficial agreement on the setting up of community offices
on the principle that it would take two years after a final agreement to prepare the appropriate office space full services were set up in brussels in expectation of a report from the committee of experts looking into the matter of a final seat
while waiting for the completion of the building on avenue de la joyeuse entr e blijde inkomstlaan offices moved to rue belliard belliardstraat on april later exclusively used by the euratom commission though with the numbers of civil servants rapidly expanding services were set up in buildings on rue du marais broekstraat avenue de broqueville de broquevillelaan avenue de tervueren tervurenlaan rue d arlon aarlenstraat rue joseph ii jozef ii straat rue de la loi wetstraat and avenue de kortenberg kortenberglaan
the belgian government further provided newly built offices on the mont des arts kunstberg rue des sols stuiversstraat for the council of ministers secretariat and european investment bank
a committee of experts deemed brussels to be the one option to have all the necessary features for a european capital a large active metropolis without a congested center or poor quality of housing good communications with other member states capitals including to major commercial and maritime markets vast internal transport links an important international business center plentiful housing for european civil servants and an open economy
furthermore it was located halfway between france and germany as in the case of other seats of european institutions and on the border between the two major european civilizations the latin world french walloon and the germanic world dutch flemish and was at the center of the first post war integration experiment the benelux
as a capital of a small country it also could not claim to use the presence of institutions to exert pressure on other member states it being more of a neutral territory between the major european powers
the committee s report was approved of by the council parliament and commissions however the council was still unable to achieve a final vote on the issue and hence put off the issue for a further three years despite all the institutions now leading in moving to brussels
the decision was put off due to the varied national positions preventing a unanimous decision
luxembourg fought to keep the ecsc or have compensation france fought for strasbourg italy initially backing paris fought for any italian city to thwart luxembourg and strasbourg
meanwhile the parliament passed a series of resolutions complaining about the whole situation of spreading itself across three cities though unable to do anything about it
the merger treaty was seen as an appropriate moment to finally resolve the issue the separate commissions and councils were to be merged
luxembourg concerned about losing the high authority proposed a split between brussels and luxembourg
the commission and council in the former with luxembourg keeping the court and parliamentary assembly together with a few of the commission s departments
this was largely welcomed but opposed by france not wishing to see the parliament leave strasbourg and by the parliament itself which wished to be with the executives and was further annoyed by the fact it was not consulted on the matter of its own location
hence the status quo was maintained with some adjustments the commission with most of its departments would be in brussels as would the council except for april june and october when it would meet in luxembourg
in addition luxembourg would keep the court of justice some of the commission s departments and the secretariat of the european parliament
strasbourg would continue to host the parliament
joining the commission was the merged council secretariat
the ecsc secretariat merged with the eec s and eaec s in the ravenstein building which then moved to the charlemagne building next to the berlaymont in
in brussels staff continued to be spread across a number of buildings on rue belliard avenue de la joyeuse entr e rue du marais and at the mont des arts
the first purpose built building was the berlaymont building in designed to house officials which soon proved too small causing the institution to spread out across the neighborhood
yet despite the agreement to host these institutions in brussels its formal status was still unclear and hence the city sought to strengthen its hand with major investment in buildings and infrastructure including the metro station schuman
however these initial developments were sporadic with little town planning and based on speculation see brusselisation
the agreement was a source of contention for the parliament which wished to be closer to the other institutions so it began moving some of its decision making bodies committee and political group meetings to brussels
in it went further by symbolically holding a plenary session in brussels in the basement of the mont des arts congress centre
however the meeting was a fiasco and the poor facilities partly discredited brussels aim of being the sole seat of the institutions
things looked up for brussels when the parliament gained its own plenary chamber in brussels on rue wiertz wiertzstraat in for some of its part sessions
this was done unofficially due to the sensitive nature of the parliament s seat with the building being constructed under the name of an international conference center
when france unsuccessfully challenged the parliament s half move to brussels in the court of justice the parliament s victory led it to build full facilities in brussels
in response the edinburgh european council of adopted a final agreement on the location of the institutions
according to this decision which was subsequently annexed to the treaty of amsterdam although the parliament was required to hold some of its sessions including its budget session in strasbourg extra sessions and committees could meet in brussels
it also reaffirmed the presence of the commission and council in the city
shortly before this summit the commission moved into the breydel building
this was due to asbestos being discovered in the berlaymont forcing its evacuation in
the commission threatened to move out of the city which would have destroyed brussels s chances of hosting the parliament so the government stepped in to build the breydel building a short distance from the berlaymont in months ensuring the commission could move in before the edinburgh summit
shortly after edinburgh the parliament bought its new building in brussels
with the status of brussels now clear ngos lobbyists advisory bodies and regional offices started basing themselves in the quarter near the institutions
the council which had been expanding into further buildings as it grew consolidated once more in the justus lipsius building and in it was agreed that the european council should also be based in brussels having previously moved between different cities as the eu s presidency rotated
from all councils were meant to be held in brussels however some extraordinary meetings are still held elsewhere
the reason for the move was in part due to the experience of the belgian police in dealing with protesters and the fixed facilities in brussels
the commission employs people and the parliament employs about people
because of this concentration brussels is a preferred location for any move towards a single seat for parliament
despite it not formally being the capital of the eu some commentators see the fact that brussels enticed an increasing number of the parliament s sessions to the city in addition to the main seats of the other two main political institutions as making brussels the de facto capital of the eu
brussels is frequently labelled as the capital of the eu particularly in publications by local authorities the commission and press
indeed brussels interprets the agreement on seats details below as declaring brussels as the capital
there are two further cities hosting major institutions luxembourg judicial and second seats and strasbourg parliament s main seat
authorities in strasbourg and organizations based there also refer to strasbourg as the capital of europe and brussels strasbourg and luxembourg are also referred to as the joint capitals of europe
in then vice president of the united states joe biden while speaking to the european parliament said as you probably know some american politicians and american journalists refer to washington d c
as the capital of the free world but it seems to me that in this great city which boasts years of history and which serves as the capital of belgium the home of the european union and the headquarters for nato this city has its own legitimate claim to that title
brussels is a center of political activity with ambassadors to belgium nato and the european union being based in the city
there s also a greater number of press corps in brussels with media outlets in every union member state having a brussels correspondent and there are lobbyists registered
the total number of journalists accredited to the eu institutions was as of late october
this is marginally higher than when there were reporters and almost the same as after the big bang enlargement of
in addition to the journalists accredited to the eu there are technicians cameramen photographers producers etc bringing the total number of accreditation badges to
belgium supplies by far the largest share of technicians with germany on and france on
brussels is located in one of the most urbanized regions of europe between paris london the rhine ruhr germany and the randstad netherlands
via high speed trains brussels is around hr min from paris hr min from london amsterdam and cologne with adjacent d sseldorf and rhine ruhr and hr from frankfurt
the eurocap rail project plans to improve brussels links to the south to luxembourg city and strasbourg
brussels is also served by brussels airport located in the nearby flemish municipality of zaventem and by the smaller brussels south charleroi airport located near charleroi wallonia some km mi from brussels
most of the european union s brussels based institutions are located within its european quarter french quartier europ en dutch europese wijk which is the unofficial name of the area corresponding to the approximate triangle between brussels park cinquantenaire park and leopold park with the european parliament s hemicycle extending into the latter
the commission and council are located in the heart of this area near schuman station at the schuman roundabout on rue de la loi
the european parliament is located over brussels luxembourg station next to luxembourg square
the area much of which was known as the leopold quarter for much of its history was historically residential an aspect which was rapidly lost as the institutions moved in although the change from a residential area to a more office oriented one had already been underway for some time before the arrival of the european institutions
historical and residential buildings although still present have been largely replaced by modern offices
these buildings were built not according to a high quality master plan or government initiative but according to speculative private sector construction of office space without which most buildings of the institutions would not have been built
however due to brussels s attempts to consolidate its position there was large government investment in infrastructure in the quarter
authorities are keen to stress that the previous chaotic development has ended being replaced by planned architecture competitions and a master plan see future below
architect benoit moritz has argued that the area has been an elite enclave surrounded by poorer districts since the mid th century and that the contrast today is comparable to an indian city
however he also said that the city has made progress over the last decade in mixing land uses bringing in more businesses and residences and that the institutions are more open to interacting with the city
the quarter s land use is very homogenous and criticised by some for example former commission president romano prodi for being an administrative ghetto isolated from the rest of the city though this view is not shared by all
there is also a perceived lack of symbolism with some such as rem koolhaas proposing that brussels needs an architectural symbol to represent europe akin to the eiffel tower or colosseum
others do not think this is in keeping with the idea of the eu with umberto eco viewing brussels as a soft capital rather than it being an imperial city of an empire it should reflect the eu s position as the server of europe
despite this the plans for redevelopment intend to deal with a certain extent of visual identity in the quarter
the most iconic structure is the berlaymont the primary seat of the commission
it was the first building to be constructed for the community originally built in the s
it was designed by lucien de vestel jean gilson andr polak and jean polak and paid for by the belgian government who could occupy it if the commission left brussels
it was inspired by the unesco headquarters building in paris designed as a four pointed star on supporting columns and at the time an ambitious design
originally built with flock asbestos the building was renovated in the s to remove it and renovate the ageing building to cope with enlargement
after a period of exile in the breydel building on avenue d auderghem oudergemlaan the commission reoccupied the berlaymont in and bought the building for million
the president of the commission occupies the largest office near the commission s meeting room on the top th floor
although the main commission building it houses only out of the commission officials based in brussels
in addition to the commissioners and their cabinets the berlaymont also houses the commission s secretariat general and legal service
across the quarter the commission occupies m sq ft in buildings with the berlaymont and charlemagne buildings the only ones over m sq ft
across rue de la loi from the berlayont is the europa building which the council of the european union and the european council have used as their headquarters since the beginning of
their former home in the adjacent justus lipsius building is still used for low level meetings and to house the council secretariat which has been located in brussels city centre and the charlemagne building during the course of its history
the renovation and construction of the new council building was intended to change the image the european quarter and was designed by the architect philippe samyn to be a feminine and jazzy building to contrast with the hard more masculine architecture of other eu buildings
the building features a lantern shaped structure surrounded by a glass atrium made up of recycled windows from across europe intended to appear united from afar but showing their diversity up close
the european parliament s buildings are located to the south between leopold park and luxembourg square over brussels luxembourg station which is underground
the complex known as the espace l opold or leopoldsruimte in dutch has two main buildings paul henri spaak and altiero spinelli which cover m sq ft
the complex is not the official seat of the parliament with its work being split with strasbourg its official seat and luxembourg its secretariat
however the decision making bodies of the parliament along with its committees and some of its plenary sessions are held in brussels to the extent that three quarters of its activity take place in brussels
the parliament buildings were extended with the new d and d buildings being completed and occupied in and
it is believed the complex now provides enough space for parliament with no major new building projects foreseen the european external action service eeas has been based in the triangle building since december
the eeas s bodies related to the common security and defence policy csdp are situated in the kortenberg building
the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions together occupy the delors building which is next to leopold park and used to be occupied by the parliament
they also use the office building bertha von suttner
both buildings were named in
brussels also hosts two agencies the european defence agency located on rue des drapiers lakenweversstraat and the executive agency for competitiveness and innovation in madou tower
there is also eurocontrol a semi eu air traffic control agency covering much of europe and the western european union which is a non eu military organisation which is merging into the eu s cfsp
the eu s presence in brussels has created significant social and economic impact
jean luc vanraes nl member of the brussels parliament responsible for the city s external relations goes as far to say the prosperity of brussels is a consequence of the european presence
as well as the institutions themselves large companies are drawn to the city due to the eu s presence
in total about of the city has a connection to the international community
in terms of demographics of the population of brussels is from outside belgium of this half is from other eu member states
about of european civil servants live in the brussels capital region with in the municipalities around the european district in the flemish region and in the walloon region
half of civil servants are home owners
the institutions draw in directly employed and employed by representatives people to work in the city
a further people are working in brussels due to the presence of the institutions generating billion a year and foreign companies drawn into the city employ multilingual locals
in brussels there are m sq ft of occupied office space half of this is taken up by the eu institutions alone accounting for a quarter of available office space in the city
the majority of eu office space is concentrated in the leopold quarter
running costs of the eu institutions total billion a year half of which benefit brussels directly and a further come from the expenses of diplomats journalists etc
business tourism in the city generates million annual hotel room nights
there are thirty international schools pupils run by employees costing million a year
however there is considerable division between the two communities with local brussels residents feeling excluded from the eu quarter a white collar ghetto
the communities often do not mix much with expatriates having their own society
this is in part down to that many expatriates in brussels stay for short periods only and do not always learn the local languages supplanted by english globish remaining in expatriate communities and sending their children to european schools rather than local belgian ones
in september the commissioner for administrative affairs siim kallas together with minister president of the brussels capital region charles picqu unveiled plans for rebuilding the district
it would involve new buildings m sq ft of new office space but also more efficient use of existing space
this is primarily through replacing numerous smaller buildings with fewer larger buildings
in march a french belgian british team led by french architect christian de portzamparc won a competition to redesign rue de la loi between maalbeek maelbeek garden and the residence palace in the east to the small ring in the west
siim kallas stated that the project which would be put into action over a few a long period rather than all at once would create a symbolic area for the eu institutions giving body and soul to the european political project and providing the commission with extra office space
the road would be reduced from four lanes to two and be returned to two way traffic rather than all west bound and the architects proposed a tram line to run down the centre
a series of high rise buildings would be built on either side with three taller flagship high rises at the east end on the north side
charles picqu described the towers as iconic buildings that will be among the highest in brussels and that building higher allows you to turn closed blocks into open spaces the tallest buildings will be up to metres feet high though most between and but the higher the building the further back it will be set from the road
the freed up space some m sq ft would be given over to housing shops services and open spaces to give the area a more human feel
a sixth european school may also be built
on the western edge of the quarter on the small ring there would be gates to europe to add visual impact
given the delays and cost of the berlaymont and other projects the commissioner emphasises that the new plans would offer better value for money and that the designs would be subject to an international architecture competition
he also pushed that controlling the buildings carbon footprint would be an integral part of the programme
there were plans to pedestrianise parts of rue de la loi next to the berlaymont
a new place schuman schumanplein currently the schuman roundabout would be one of three new pedestrian squares
schuman would focus on policy and politics and schuman station itself will be redesigned
coverings over nearby motorways and railways would be extended to shield them from view
however the planned pedestrianisation of the schuman roundabout was cancelled in late
a pedestrian and visual link would be created between the berlaymont and leopold park by demolishing sections of the ground to fourth floors of justus lipsius the south bland facade of which would be redesigned
further pedestrian and cycle links would be created around the quarter
pedestrian routes would also be created for demonstrations
next to the parliament at leopold park the block of buildings between rue d arlon aarlenstraat and rue de tr ves trierstraat would be removed creating a broad boulevard like extension of luxembourg square the second pedestrian square focusing on citizens
the third pedestrian square would be the esplanade du cinquantenaire or esplanade van het jubelpark for events and festivities
wider development may also surround cinquantenaire park with plans for a new metro station underground car park and the europeanisation of part of the cinquantenaire complex with a socio cultural facility
it is possible that the european council may have to move to this area from the europa building for security reasons
the concentration of offices in the main quarter has led to increase real estate prices due to the increased demand and reduced space
in response to this problem the commission has since begun decentralising across the city to areas such as avenue de beaulieu beaulieulaan in auderghem and rue de gen ve genevestraat in evere
this has reduced price increases but it is still one of the most expensive areas in the city per square metre compared to per on average
neither the parliament nor the council have followed suit however and the policy of decentralisation is unpopular among the commission s staff
nevertheless the commission intends to develop two or three large poles outside the quarter each greater than m sq ft
heysel park has been proposed as one of the new poles by the city of brussels which intends to develop the area as an international district regardless
the park built around the atomium landmark already hosts a european school has the largest parking facilities in belgium a metro station an exhibition hall and the mini europe park
the city intends to build an international conference centre with seats and an important commercial centre the commission will respond to the proposal in the first half of
as for the existing beaulieu pole which is to the south east of the main european quarter there is a proposal to link it with the main quarter by covering the railway lines between beaulieu and the european parliament the esplanade of which sits on top of brussels luxembourg railway station
traffic on the lines is expected to increase creating environmental problems that would be solved by covering the lines
the surface would then be covered by flagstones in the same manner as parliament s esplanade to create a pedestrian cyclist path between the two districts
the plan proposes that this promenade of europeans of metres feet be divided into areas dedicated to each of the member states
belgium operates a complex federal system and is divided into three regions with the brussels capital region being an independent region alongside flanders and wallonia
the regions are mostly responsible for the economy mobility and other territory related matters
belgium is also divided into three communities the flemish community the french community and the german speaking community
these communities are responsible for language related matters such as culture or education
brussels does not belong to any community but has a bilingual status so brussels inhabitants may enjoy education cultural affairs and education organized by the flemish and or the french community
this structure is the result of many compromises in the political spectrum going from separatism to unionism while also combining the wishes of the brussels population to have a degree of independence as well as those of the flemish and walloon populations to having a level of influence over brussels
the system has been criticised by some but it has also been compared to the eu as a laboratory of europe
in the hypothetical scenario of a separation of belgium the future status of brussels is unknown
it might become an eu member state or jointly run by the nations formed from belgium and the eu itself
the possible status of brussels as a city state has also been suggested by charles picqu former minister president of the brussels capital region who sees a tax on the eu institutions as a way of enriching the city
however the belgian issue has very little discussion within the eu bodies
the boundaries of the brussels capital region were determined from the language census data
this was the last time that some municipalities were legally converted from monolingual dutch speaking into bilingual municipalities joined with the brussels agglomeration
the suggestive nature of the questions led to massive protests in flanders especially around brussels causing it to be unlikely to ever hold a language related census again in belgium
the result is that the brussels region is now a lot smaller than the french speaking influence around the capital and that there is very little space left in brussels for important expansions of its infrastructure
enlarging the territory of brussels could potentially give it around million inhabitants an airport a bigger forest and bring the brussels ring road onto brussels territory
a large and independent status may also help brussels in its claim as the capital of the eu
