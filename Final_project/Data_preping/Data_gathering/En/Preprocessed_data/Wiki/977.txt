brussels belgium considered de facto capital european union long history hosting number principal eu institution within european quarter
eu ha official capital plan declare one brussels host official seat european commission council european union european council well seat officially second seat de facto important one european parliament
presence generated million euro regional gdp job regional employment
main rationale brussels chosen capital european union wa halfway location france germany two country whose rivalry led two world war whose reconciliation paved way european integration
leader six european country belgium luxembourg netherlands france italy west germany signed treaty paris created european coal steel community ecsc new community came first institution high authority council minister court justice common assembly
number city considered brussels would accepted compromise belgian government put effort backing lige opposed member wa unable formally back brussels due internal instability
agreement remained elusive seat found institution could begin work hence luxembourg wa chosen provisional seat though common assembly strasbourg wa city large enough hemicycle one used council europe
agreement wa temporary plan set relocate institution saarbrcken would serve european district occur
treaty rome established two new community european economic community eec european atomic energy community euratom
shared assembly court ecsc created two new set council commission equivalent ecsc's high authority
discussion seat institution left till last moment treaty came force interfere ratification
brussels waited month talk enter application received unofficial backing several member states
member agreed principle locate executive council assembly one city though could still decide city put decision six months
meantime assembly would stay strasbourg new commission would meet alternatively ecsc seat chteau val-duchesse brussels headquarters temporary committee
practice wa castle brussels autumn moved central brussels rue ravensteinravensteinstraat
brussels missed bid single seat due weak campaign government negotiation despite widespread support people
belgian government eventually pushed campaign started large-scale construction renting office space east city use institutions
february six government concluded unofficial agreement setting-up community offices
principle would take two year final agreement prepare appropriate office space full service set brussels expectation report committee expert looking matter final seat
waiting completion building avenue de la joyeuse entreblijde inkomstlaan office moved rue belliardbelliardstraat april later exclusively used euratom commission though number civil servant rapidly expanding service set building rue du maraisbroekstraat avenue de broquevillede broquevillelaan avenue de tervuerentervurenlaan rue d'arlonaarlenstraat
belgian government provided newly built office mont de artskunstberg rue de solsstuiversstraat council ministers' secretariat european investment bank
committee expert deemed brussels one option necessary feature european capital large active metropolis without congested center poor quality housing good communication member states' capital including major commercial maritime market vast internal transport link important international business center plentiful housing european
furthermore wa located halfway france germany case seat european institution border two major european civilization latin world french walloon germanic world dutch flemish wa center first post-war integration experiment benelux
capital small country also could claim use presence institution exert pressure member state neutral territory major european powers
committee's report wa approved council parliament commission however council wa still unable achieve final vote issue hence put issue three year despite institution leading moving brussels
decision wa put due varied national position preventing unanimous decision
luxembourg fought keep ecsc compensation france fought strasbourg italy initially backing paris fought italian city thwart luxembourg strasbourg
meanwhile parliament passed series resolution complaining whole situation spreading across three city though unable anything it
merger treaty wa seen appropriate moment finally resolve issue separate commission council merged
luxembourg concerned losing high authority proposed split brussels luxembourg
commission council former luxembourg keeping court parliamentary assembly together commission's departments
wa largely welcomed opposed france wishing see parliament leave strasbourg parliament wished executive wa annoyed fact wa consulted matter location
hence status quo wa maintained adjustment commission department would brussels would council except april june october would meet luxembourg
addition luxembourg would keep court justice commission's department secretariat european parliament
ecsc secretariat merged eec's eaec's ravenstein building moved charlemagne building next berlaymont in
brussels staff continued spread across number building rue belliard avenue de la joyeuse entre rue du marais mont de arts
first purpose-built building wa berlaymont building designed house official soon proved small causing institution spread across neighborhood
yet despite agreement host institution brussels formal status wa still unclear hence city sought strengthen hand major investment building infrastructure including metro station schuman
however initial development sporadic little town planning based speculation see brusselisation
agreement wa source contention parliament wished closer institution began moving decision making body committee political group meeting brussels
went symbolically holding plenary session brussels basement mont de art congress centre
however meeting wa fiasco poor facility partly discredited brussels' aim sole seat institutions
thing looked brussels parliament gained plenary chamber brussels rue wiertzwiertzstraat part-sessions
wa done unofficially due sensitive nature parliament's seat building constructed name international conference center
france unsuccessfully challenged parliament's half-move brussels court justice parliament's victory led build full facility brussels
response edinburgh european council adopted final agreement location institutions
according decision wa subsequently annexed treaty amsterdam although parliament wa required hold session including budget session strasbourg extra session committee could meet brussels
wa due asbestos discovered berlaymont forcing evacuation in
commission threatened move city would destroyed brussels's chance hosting parliament government stepped build breydel building short distance berlaymont month ensuring commission could move edinburgh summit
status brussels clear ngo lobbyist advisory body regional office started basing quarter near institutions
council expanding building grew consolidated justus lipsius building wa agreed european council also based brussels previously moved different city eu's presidency rotated
council meant held brussels however extraordinary meeting still held elsewhere
reason move wa part due experience belgian police dealing protester fixed facility brussels
concentration brussels preferred location move towards single seat parliament
despite formally capital eu commentator see fact brussels enticed increasing number parliament's session city addition main seat two main political institution making brussels de facto capital eu
brussels frequently labelled capital eu particularly publication local authority commission press
indeed brussels interprets agreement seat detail declaring brussels capital
two city hosting major institution luxembourg judicial second seat strasbourg parliament's main seat
authority strasbourg organization based also refer strasbourg capital europe brussels strasbourg luxembourg also referred joint capital europe
