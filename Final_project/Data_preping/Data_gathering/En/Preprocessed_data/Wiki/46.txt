the city of london is a city ceremonial county and local government district that contains the historic centre and constitutes alongside canary wharf the primary central business district cbd of london
it constituted most of london from its settlement by the romans in the st century ad to the middle ages but the modern area named london has since grown far beyond the city of london boundary
the city is now only a small part of the metropolis of greater london though it remains a notable part of central london
administratively the city of london is not one of the london boroughs a status reserved for the other districts including greater london s only other city the city of westminster
it is also a separate ceremonial county being an enclave surrounded by greater london and is the smallest ceremonial county in the united kingdom
the city of london is widely referred to simply as the city differentiated from the phrase the city of london by capitalising city and known as the square mile as it is sq mi acres km in area
both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the united kingdom s trading and financial services industries which continue a notable history of being largely based in the city
the name london is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the city
london most often denotes the sprawling london metropolis or the greater london boroughs in addition to the city of london itself
this wider usage of london is documented as far back as when the county of london was created
the local authority for the city namely the city of london corporation is unique in the uk and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council such as being the police authority
it is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries
the corporation is headed by the lord mayor of the city of london an office separate from and much older than the mayor of london
the lord mayor as of november is vincent keaveny
the city is made up of wards with administration at the historic guildhall
other historic sites include st paul s cathedral royal exchange mansion house old bailey and smithfield market
although not within the city the adjacent tower of london is part of its old defensive perimeter
the city has responsibility for five bridges in its capacity as trustee of the bridge house estates blackfriars bridge millennium bridge southwark bridge london bridge and tower bridge
the city is a major business and financial centre and the bank of england is headquartered in the city
throughout the th century the city was the world s primary business centre and it continues to be a major meeting point for businesses
london came top in the worldwide centres of commerce index published in
the insurance industry is located in the eastern side of the city around lloyd s building
a secondary financial district exists outside the city at canary wharf miles km to the east
the city has a resident population of ons estimate mid but over are employed there and some estimates put the number of workers in the city to be over million
about three quarters of the jobs in the city of london are in the financial professional and associated business services sectors
the legal profession forms a major component of the northern and western sides of the city especially in the temple and chancery lane areas where the inns of court are located of which two inner temple and middle temple fall within the city of london boundary
the roman legions established a settlement known as londinium on the current site of the city of london around ad
its bridge over the river thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port serving as a major commercial centre in roman britain until its abandonment during the th century
archaeologist leslie wallace notes that because extensive archaeological excavation has not revealed any signs of a significant pre roman presence arguments for a purely roman foundation of london are now common and uncontroversial
at its height the roman city had a population of approximately inhabitants
londinium was an ethnically diverse city with inhabitants from across the roman empire including natives of britannia continental europe the middle east and north africa
the romans built the london wall some time between ad and
the boundaries of the roman city were similar to those of the city of london today though the city extends further west than londinium s ludgate and the thames was undredged and thus wider than it is today with londinium s shoreline slightly north of the city s present shoreline
the romans built a bridge across the river as early as ad near to today s london bridge
by the time the london wall was constructed the city s fortunes were in decline and it faced problems of plague and fire
the roman empire entered a long period of instability and decline including the carausian revolt in britain
in the rd and th centuries the city was under attack from picts scots and saxon raiders
the decline continued both for londinium and the empire and in ad the romans withdrew entirely from britain
many of the roman public buildings in londinium by this time had fallen into decay and disuse and gradually after the formal withdrawal the city became almost if not at times entirely uninhabited
the centre of trade and population moved away from the walled londinium to lundenwic london market a settlement to the west roughly in the modern day strand aldwych covent garden area
during the anglo saxon heptarchy the london area came in turn under the kingdoms of essex mercia and later wessex though from the mid th century it was frequently under the control of or threat from the vikings
bede records that in ad st augustine consecrated mellitus as the first bishop to the anglo saxon kingdom of the east saxons and their king s berht
s berht s uncle and overlord thelberht king of kent built a church dedicated to st paul in london as the seat of the new bishop
it is assumed although unproven that this first anglo saxon cathedral stood on the same site as the later medieval and the present cathedrals
alfred the great king of wessex occupied and began the resettlement of the old roman walled area in and appointed his son in law earl thelred of mercia over it as part of their reconquest of the viking occupied parts of england
the refortified anglo saxon settlement was known as lundenburh london fort a borough
the historian asser said that alfred king of the anglo saxons restored the city of london splendidly
and made it habitable once more alfred s restoration entailed reoccupying and refurbishing the nearly deserted roman walled city building quays along the thames and laying a new city street plan
alfred s taking of london and the rebuilding of the old roman city was a turning point in history not only as the permanent establishment of the city of london but also as part of a unifying moment in early england with wessex becoming the dominant english kingdom and the repelling to some degree of the viking occupation and raids
while london and indeed england were afterwards subjected to further periods of viking and danish raids and occupation the establishment of the city of london and the kingdom of england prevailed
in the th century athelstan permitted eight mints to be established compared with six in his capital winchester indicating the wealth of the city
london bridge which had fallen into ruin following the roman evacuation and abandonment of londinium was rebuilt by the saxons but was periodically destroyed by viking raids and storms
as the focus of trade and population was moved back to within the old roman walls the older saxon settlement of lundenwic was largely abandoned and gained the name of ealdwic the old settlement
the name survives today as aldwych the old market place a name of a street and an area of the city of westminster between westminster and the city of london
following the battle of hastings william the conqueror marched on london reaching as far as southwark but failed to get across london bridge or to defeat the londoners
he eventually crossed the river thames at wallingford pillaging the land as he went
rather than continuing the war edgar the theling edwin of mercia and morcar of northumbria surrendered at berkhamsted
william granted the citizens of london a charter in the city was one of a few examples of the english retaining some authority
the city was not covered by the domesday book
william built three castles around the city to keep londoners subdued
tower of london which is still a major establishment
baynard s castle which no longer exists but gave its name to a city ward
montfichet s tower or castle on ludgate hill which was dismantled and sold off in the th century about henry i granted a sheriff to the people of london along with control of the county of middlesex this meant that the two entities were regarded as one administratively not that the county was a dependency of the city until the local government act
by the whole body of the citizenry was considered to constitute a single community
this commune was the origin of the city of london corporation and the citizens gained the right to appoint with the king s consent a mayor in and to directly elect the mayor from
from medieval times the city has been composed of ancient wards each headed by an alderman who chairs wardmotes which still take place at least annually
a folkmoot for the whole of the city held at the outdoor cross of st paul s cathedral was formerly also held
many of the medieval offices and traditions continue to the present day demonstrating the unique nature of the city and its corporation
in the peasants revolt affected london
the rebels took the city and the tower of london but the rebellion ended after its leader wat tyler was killed during a confrontation that included lord mayor william walworth
in rebel forces again occupied the city during jack cade s rebellion before being ousted by london citizens following a bloody battle on london bridge
the city was burnt severely on a number of occasions the worst being in and in the great fire of london in
both of these fires were referred to as the great fire
after the fire of a number of plans were drawn up to remodel the city and its street pattern into a renaissance style city with planned urban blocks squares and boulevards
these plans were almost entirely not taken up and the medieval street pattern re emerged almost intact
in the s the crown sought to have the corporation of the city of london extend its jurisdiction to surrounding areas
in what is sometimes called the great refusal the corporation said no to the king which in part accounts for its unique government structure to the present
by the late th century london increasingly became a major centre for banking international trade and commerce
the royal exchange was founded in by sir thomas gresham as a centre of commerce for london s merchants and gained royal patronage in
although no longer used for its original purpose its location at the corner of cornhill and threadneedle street continues to be the geographical centre of the city s core of banking and financial services with the bank of england moving to its present site in opposite the royal exchange
immediately to the south of cornhill lombard street was the location from of lloyd s coffee house which became the world leading insurance market
london s insurance sector continues to be based in the area particularly in lime street
in christopher wren s masterpiece st paul s cathedral was completed on his birthday
the first service had been held on december more than years earlier
it replaced the original st paul s which had been completely destroyed in the great fire of london and is considered to be one of the finest cathedrals in britain and a fine example of baroque architecture
the th century was a period of rapid growth for london reflecting an increasing national population the early stirrings of the industrial revolution and london s role at the centre of the evolving british empire
the urban area expanded beyond the borders of the city of london most notably during this period towards the west end and westminster
expansion continued and became more rapid by the beginning of the th century with london growing in all directions
to the east the port of london grew rapidly during the century with the construction of many docks needed as the thames at the city could not cope with the volume of trade
the arrival of the railways and the tube meant that london could expand over a much greater area
by the mid th century with london still rapidly expanding in population and area the city had already become only a small part of the wider metropolis
an attempt was made in with the royal commission on the amalgamation of the city and county of london to end the distinction between the city and the surrounding county of london but a change of government at westminster meant the option was not taken up
the city as a distinct polity survived despite its position within the london conurbation and numerous local government reforms
supporting this status the city was a special parliamentary borough that elected four members to the unreformed house of commons who were retained after the reform act reduced to two under the redistribution of seats act and ceased to be a separate constituency under the representation of the people act
since then the city is a minority in terms of population and area of the cities of london and westminster
the city s population fell rapidly in the th century and through most of the th century as people moved outwards in all directions to london s vast suburbs and many residential buildings were demolished to make way for office blocks
like many areas of london and other british cities the city fell victim to large scale and highly destructive aerial bombing during world war ii especially in the blitz
whilst st paul s cathedral survived the onslaught large swathes of the area did not and the particularly heavy raids of late december led to a firestorm called the second great fire of london
there was a major rebuilding programme in the decades following the war in some parts such as at the barbican dramatically altering the urban landscape
but the destruction of the older historic fabric allowed the construction of modern and larger scale developments whereas in those parts not so badly affected by bomb damage the city retains its older character of smaller buildings
the street pattern which is still largely medieval was altered slightly in places although there is a more recent trend of reversing some of the post war modernist changes made such as at paternoster square
the city suffered terrorist attacks including the bishopsgate bombing ira and the july london bombings islamist
in response to the bombing a system of road barriers checkpoints and surveillance cameras referred to as the ring of steel has been maintained to control entry points to the city
the s saw the construction of tall office buildings including the foot m storey natwest tower the first skyscraper in the uk
office space development has intensified especially in the central northern and eastern parts with skyscrapers including st
mary axe the gherkin leadenhall building the cheesegrater fenchurch street the walkie talkie the broadgate tower the heron tower and bishopsgate which is the tallest building in the city
the main residential section of the city today is the barbican estate constructed between and
the museum of london is based there as are a number of other services provided by the corporation
the city has a unique political status a legacy of its uninterrupted integrity as a corporate city since the anglo saxon period and its singular relationship with the crown
historically its system of government was not unusual but it was not reformed by the municipal reform act and little changed by later reforms so that it is the only local government in the uk where elections are not run on the basis of one vote for every adult citizen
it is administered by the city of london corporation headed by the lord mayor of london not to be confused with the separate mayor of london an office created only in the year which is responsible for a number of functions and has interests in land beyond the city s boundaries
unlike other english local authorities the corporation has two council bodies the now largely ceremonial court of aldermen and the court of common council
the court of aldermen represents the wards with each ward irrespective of size returning one alderman
the chief executive of the corporation holds the ancient office of town clerk of london
the city is a ceremonial county which has a commission of lieutenancy headed by the lord mayor instead of a lord lieutenant and has two sheriffs instead of a high sheriff see list of sheriffs of london quasi judicial offices appointed by the livery companies an ancient political system based on the representation and protection of trades guilds
senior members of the livery companies are known as liverymen and form the common hall which chooses the lord mayor the sheriffs and certain other officers
the city is made up of wards
they are survivors of the medieval government system that allowed a very local area to exist as a self governing unit within the wider city
they can be described as electoral political divisions ceremonial geographic and administrative entities sub divisions of the city
each ward has an alderman who until the mid s held office for life but since put themselves up for re election at least every years
wards continue to have a beadle an ancient position which is now largely ceremonial whose main remaining function is the running of an annual wardmote of electors representatives and officials
at the wardmote the ward s alderman appoints at least one deputy for the year ahead
each ward also has a ward club which is similar to a residents association
the wards are ancient and their number has changed three times since time immemorial
in farringdon was divided into farringdon within and farringdon without
in the ward of bridge without south of the river was created the ward of bridge becoming bridge within
in these bridge wards were merged as bridge ward following boundary changes in and later reform of the business vote in the city there was a major boundary and electoral representation revision of the wards in and they were reviewed again in for change in though not to such a dramatic extent
the review was conducted by senior officers of the corporation and senior judges of the old bailey the wards are reviewed by this process to avoid malapportionment
the procedure of review is unique in the united kingdom as it is not conducted by the electoral commission or a local government boundary commission every to years which is the case for all other wards in great britain
particular churches livery company halls and other historic buildings and structures are associated with a ward such as st paul s cathedral with castle baynard and london bridge with bridge boundary changes in removed some of these historic connections
each ward elects an alderman to the court of aldermen and commoners the city equivalent of a councillor to the court of common council of the corporation
only electors who are freemen of the city of london are eligible to stand
the number of commoners a ward sends to the common council varies from two to ten depending on the number of electors in each ward
since the review it has been agreed that the four more residential wards portsoken queenhithe aldersgate and cripplegate together elect of the commoners whereas the business dominated remainder elect the remaining commoners
and boundary changes have increased the residential emphasis of the mentioned four wards
census data provides eight nominal rather than real wards all of varying size and population
being subject to renaming and definition at any time these census wards are notable in that four of the eight wards accounted for of the square mile and held of the population and these were in fact similar to and named after four city of london wards
the city has a unique electoral system
most of its voters are representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the city
its ancient wards have very unequal numbers of voters
in elections both the businesses based in the city and the residents of the city vote
the city of london corporation was not reformed by the municipal corporations act because it had a more extensive electoral franchise than any other borough or city in fact it widened this further with its own equivalent legislation allowing one to become a freeman without being a liveryman
in the city had a population of about but increasing development of the city as a central business district led to this falling to below after the second world war
it has risen slightly to around since largely due to the development of the barbican estate
in the business vote was about greatly exceeding residential voters
as the city of london corporation has not been affected by other municipal legislation over the period of time since then its electoral practice has become increasingly anomalous
uniquely for city or borough elections its elections remain independent dominated
the business or non residential vote was abolished in other uk local council elections by the representation of the people act but was preserved in the city of london
the principal reason given by successive uk governments for retaining this mechanism for giving businesses representation is that the city is primarily a place for doing business
about non residents constitute the day time population and use most of its services far outnumbering residents who number around
by contrast opponents of the retention of the business vote argue that it is a cause of institutional inertia
the city of london ward elections act a private act of parliament reformed the voting system and greatly increased the business franchise allowing many more businesses to be represented
under the new system the number of non resident voters has doubled from to
previously disenfranchised firms and other organisations are entitled to nominate voters in addition to those already represented and all such bodies are now required to choose their voters in a representative fashion
bodies employing fewer than people may appoint voter those employing to people voter for every employees those employing more than people voters and additional voter for each employees beyond the first
the act also removed other anomalies which had been unchanged since the s
inner temple and middle temple which neighbour each other are two of the few remaining liberties an old name for a geographic division
they are independent extra parochial areas historically not governed by the city of london corporation and are today regarded as local authorities for most purposes and equally outside the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the bishop of london
they are within the boundaries and liberties of the city but can be thought of as independent enclaves
they are both part of farringdon without
within the city the corporation owns and runs both smithfield market and leadenhall market
it owns land beyond its boundaries including open spaces parks forests and commons in and around greater london including most of epping forest and hampstead heath
the corporation owns old spitalfields market and billingsgate fish market in the neighbouring london borough of tower hamlets
it owns and helps fund the old bailey the central criminal court for england and wales as a gift to the nation having begun as the city and middlesex sessions
the honourable the irish society a body closely linked with the corporation also owns many public spaces in northern ireland
the city has its own independent police force the city of london police the common council the main body of the corporation is the police authority
the corporation also run the hampstead heath constabulary epping forest keepers and the city of london market constabularies whose members are no longer attested as constables but retain the historic title
the majority of greater london is policed by the metropolitan police service based at new scotland yard
the city has one hospital st bartholomew s hospital also known as barts
founded in it is located at smithfield and is undergoing a long awaited regeneration after doubts as to its continuing use during the s
the city is the third largest uk patron of the arts
it oversees the barbican centre and subsidises several important performing arts companies
the london port health authority which is the responsibility of the corporation is responsible for all port health functions on the tidal part of the thames including various seaports and london city airport
the corporation oversees the bridge house estates which maintains blackfriars bridge millennium bridge southwark bridge london bridge and tower bridge
the city s flag flies over tower bridge although neither footing is in the city
the size of the city was constrained by a defensive perimeter wall known as london wall which was built by the romans in the late nd century to protect their strategic port city
however the boundaries of the city of london no longer coincide with the old city wall as the city expanded its jurisdiction slightly over time
during the medieval era the city s jurisdiction expanded westwards crossing the historic western border of the original settlement the river fleet along fleet street to temple bar
the city also took in the other city bars which were situated just beyond the old walled area such as at holborn aldersgate west smithfield bishopsgate and aldgate
these were the important entrances to the city and their control was vital in maintaining the city s special privileges over certain trades
most of the wall has disappeared but several sections remain visible
a section near the museum of london was revealed after the devastation of an air raid on december at the height of the blitz
other visible sections are at st alphage and there are two sections near the tower of london
the river fleet was canalised after the great fire of and then in stages was bricked up and has been since the th century one of london s lost rivers or streams today underground as a storm drain
the boundary of the city was unchanged until minor boundary changes on april when it expanded slightly to the west north and east taking small parcels of land from the london boroughs of westminster camden islington hackney and tower hamlets
the main purpose of these changes was to tidy up the boundary where it had been rendered obsolete by changes in the urban landscape
in this process the city also lost small parcels of land though there was an overall net gain the city grew from to square miles
most notably the changes placed the then recently developed broadgate estate entirely in the city
southwark to the south of the city on the other side of the thames was within the city between and as the ward of bridge without a situation connected with the guildable manor
the city s administrative responsibility there had in practice disappeared by the mid victorian period as various aspects of metropolitan government were extended into the neighbouring areas
today it is part of the london borough of southwark
the tower of london has always been outside the city and comes under the london borough of tower hamlets
the corporation of the city of london has a full achievement of armorial bearings consisting of a shield on which the arms are displayed a crest displayed on a helm above the shield supporters on either side and a motto displayed on a scroll beneath the arms
the coat of arms is anciently recorded at the college of arms
the arms consist of a silver shield bearing a red cross with a red upright sword in the first quarter
they combine the emblems of the patron saints of england and london the cross of st george with the symbol of the martyrdom of saint paul
the sword is often erroneously supposed to commemorate the killing of peasants revolt leader wat tyler by lord mayor of london william walworth
however the arms were in use some months before tyler s death and the tradition that walworth s dagger is depicted may date from the late th century
the latin motto of the city is domine dirige nos which translates as lord direct us
it is thought to have been adopted in the th century as the earliest record of it is in
a banner of the arms the design on the shield is flown as a flag
the city of london is the smallest ceremonial county of england by area and population and the fourth most densely populated
of the english districts it is the second smallest by population after the isles of scilly and the smallest by area
it is also the smallest english city by population and in britain only two cities in wales are smaller and the smallest in the uk by area
the elevation of the city ranges from sea level at the thames to metres ft at the junction of high holborn and chancery lane
two small but notable hills are within the historic core ludgate hill to the west and cornhill to the east
between them ran the walbrook one of the many lost rivers or streams of london another is the fleet
official boundary mapbeginning in the west where the city borders westminster the boundary crosses the victoria embankment from the thames passes to the west of middle temple then turns for a short distance along strand and then north up chancery lane where it borders camden
it turns east along holborn to holborn circus and then goes northeast to charterhouse street
as it crosses farringdon road it becomes the boundary with islington
it continues to aldersgate goes north and turns east into some back streets soon after aldersgate becomes goswell road since embracing all of the corporation s golden lane estate
here at baltic street west is the most northerly extent
the boundary includes all of the barbican estate and continues east along ropemaker street and its continuation on the other side of moorgate becomes south place
it goes north reaching the border with hackney then east north east on back streets with worship street forming a northern boundary so as to include the broadgate estate
the boundary then turns south at norton folgate and becomes the border with tower hamlets
it continues south into bishopsgate and takes some backstreets to middlesex street petticoat lane where it continues south east then south
it then turns south west crossing the minories so as to exclude the tower of london and then reaches the river
it then runs up the centre of the thames with the exception that blackfriars bridge falls within the city the city controls london bridge as part of bridge ward but only half of the river underneath it
the boundaries are marked by black bollards bearing the city s emblem and by dragon boundary marks at major entrances such as holborn
a more substantial monument marks the boundary at temple bar on fleet street
in some places the financial district extends slightly beyond the boundaries notably to the north and east into the london boroughs of tower hamlets hackney and islington and informally these locations are seen as part of the square mile
since the s the eastern fringe extending into hackney and tower hamlets has increasingly been a focus for large office developments due to the availability of large sites compared to within the city
the city has no sizeable parks within its boundary but does have a network of a large number of gardens and small open spaces many of them maintained by the corporation
these range from formal gardens such as the one in finsbury circus containing a bowling green and bandstand to churchyards such as st olave hart street to water features and artwork in courtyards and pedestrianised lanes
gardens include
barber surgeon s hall garden london wall
cleary garden queen victoria street
finsbury circus blomfield street london wall moorgate
jubilee garden houndsditch
portsoken street garden portsoken street goodman s yard
postman s park little britain
seething lane garden seething lane
st dunstan in the east st dunstan s hill
st mary aldermanbury aldermanbury
st olave hart street churchyard seething lane
st paul s churchyard st paul s cathedral
west smithfield garden west smithfield
whittington gardens college streetthere are a number of private gardens and open spaces often within courtyards of the larger commercial developments
two of the largest are those of the inner temple and middle temple inns of court in the far southwest
the thames and its riverside walks are increasingly being valued as open space and in recent years efforts have been made to increase the ability for pedestrians to access and walk along the river
the nearest weather station has historically been the london weather centre at kingsway holborn although observations ceased in
now st
james park provides the nearest official readings
the city has an oceanic climate k ppen cfb modified by the urban heat island in the centre of london
this generally causes higher night time minima than outlying areas
for example the august mean minimum of c f compares to a figure of c f for greenwich and heathrow whereas is c f at wisley in the middle of several square miles of metropolitan green belt
all figures refer to the observation period
accordingly the weather station holds the record for the uk s warmest overnight minimum temperature c f recorded on august
the maximum is c f set on august
the absolute minimum for the weather station is a mere c f compared to readings around c f towards the edges of london
unusually this temperature was during a windy and snowy cold spell mid january rather than a cold clear night cold air drainage is arrested due to the vast urban area surrounding the city
the station holds the record for the highest british mean monthly temperature c f mean maximum c f mean minimum c f during july
