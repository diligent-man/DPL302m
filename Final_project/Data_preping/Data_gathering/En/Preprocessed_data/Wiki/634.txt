a federated state which may also be referred to as a state a province a region a canton a land a governorate an oblast an emirate or a country is a territorial and constitutional community forming part of a federation
such states differ from fully sovereign states in that they do not have full sovereign powers as the sovereign powers have been divided between the federated states and the central or federal government
importantly federated states do not have standing as entities of international law
instead the federal union as a single entity is the sovereign state for purposes of international law
depending on the constitutional structure of a particular federation a federated state can hold various degrees of legislative judicial and administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory and is a form of regional government
in some cases a federation is created from a union of political entities which are either independent or dependent territories of another sovereign entity most commonly a colonial power
in other cases federated states have been created out of the administrative divisions of previously unitary states
once a federal constitution is formed the rules governing the relationship between federal and regional powers become part of the country s constitutional law and not international law
in countries with federal constitutions there is a division of power between the central government and the component states
these entities states provinces counties cantons l nder etc
are partially self governing and are afforded a degree of constitutionally guaranteed autonomy that varies substantially from one federation to another
depending on the form the decentralization of powers takes a federated state s legislative powers may or may not be overruled or vetoed by the federal government
laws governing the relationship between federal and regional powers can be amended through the national or federal constitution and if they exist state constitutions as well
in terms of internal politics federated states can have republican or monarchical forms of government
those of republican form federated republics are usually called states like states of the usa or republics like republics in the former ussr
