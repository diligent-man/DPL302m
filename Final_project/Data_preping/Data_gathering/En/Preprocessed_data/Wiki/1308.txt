Throughout the s Jimmy Swaggart Ministries was one of many American Evangelical leaders who promoted the South African backed Mozambican National Resistance aka RENAMO which was accused of committing systematic war crimes during Mozambique's year long civil war In addition to moral support and publicity Swaggart Ministries was repeatedly accused of providing funding and material support to the group In September government forces supported by Zimbabwe captured RENAMO's main HQ inside Mozambique Casa Banana in Gorongosa district Among the materials left behind by retreating rebels were piles of Swaggart's publication How to Receive The Baptism in the Holy Spirit translated into Portuguese During the trial of Australian missionary Ian Grey who coordinated much of the private support to RENAMO it was claimed by the defendant that Swaggart Ministries worked through ex Rhodesian soldier Michael T Howard's Shekinah Ministries to provide support to RENAMO That year extensive media coverage of Swaggart and his businesses in the wake of a sex scandal largely excluded these allegations In Covert Action Magazine and the government of Zimbabwe both accused Swaggart ministries of continuing to fund RENAMO
In Swaggart was accused of a sex scandal involving a prostitute initially resulting in his suspension and ultimately defrocking by the Assemblies of God Three years later Swaggart was implicated in another scandal involving prostitution As a result Swaggart's ministry became nonaffiliated nondenominational and significantly smaller than it was in the ministry's pre scandal years
Swaggart's first exposure was in retaliation for an incident in when he exposed fellow Assemblies of God minister Marvin Gorman whom he accused of having several affairs Once he was exposed Gorman was defrocked from the Assemblies of God and his ministry was all but ended Gorman filed a successful lawsuit against Swaggart for defamation and conspiracy to ruin his reputation which led to the award of damages amounting to million in reduced after an appeal and an out of court settlement to million
However as a retaliatory measure Gorman hired his son Randy and son in law Garland Bilbo to watch the Travel Inn on Airline Highway in Metairie a suburb of New Orleans A camera with a telephoto lens was placed in the window of the motel's Room and draped with a black cloth When Swaggart arrived he reportedly went into Room Randy Gorman and Garland Bilbo let the air out of the tires on Swaggart's vehicle They called Marvin Gorman whose church was located nearby Randy Gorman and Garland Bilbo had taken photos of Swaggart outside Room with Debra Murphree a local prostitute Gorman arrived at the Travel Inn a short while later and confronted Swaggart although on details accounts from both sides differed
According to Swaggart The Unauthorized Biography of an American Evangelist by Ann Rowe Seaman Gorman secured a promise from Swaggart that he would publicly apologize to Gorman and start the process of Gorman's reinstatement to the Assemblies of God Gorman offered to remain silent if Swaggart would state publicly that he lied about Gorman's affairs Gorman waited almost a year then hand delivered a note to Swaggart informing him his time was up Swaggart did not respond On February Gorman contacted James Hamil one of the man Executive Presbytery of the Assemblies of God who called G Raymond Carlson the Assemblies Superintendent Carlson summoned Hamill and Gorman to fly to Assemblies of God headquarters in Springfield Missouri and arranged for an emergency meeting of the presbyters He was shown photos of several men coming in and going out of Room at the Travel Inn Motel in New Orleans This was done to establish that the room was being used for prostitution One of the men shown leaving Room was Swaggart The presbytery leadership of the Assemblies of God decided that Swaggart should be suspended from broadcasting his television program for three months
According to the Associated Press Murphree who claimed to have posed nude for Swaggart failed a polygraph test administered by a New York City Police Department polygraph expert The test administrator concluded that Murphree had failed to tell the truth on all key questions concerning her statement The test was administered after Murphree offered to sell the story to the National Enquirer for Paul Levy senior editor for the Enquirer stated that the polygraph examiner had concluded Murphree was not truthful on six key questions including one in which she was reportedly asked if she had fabricated the story Levy stated that the Enquirer decided not to print her story due to the test results her drug use and the fact that she had arrest warrants in three states Murphree failed questions about whether she was paid or promised money to set up Swaggart and whether she made up the story to make money from it
On February without giving any details regarding his transgressions Swaggart delivered what came to be known as his I have sinned speech on live television He spoke tearfully to his family congregation TV audience and ended it with a prayer I have sinned against You my Lord and I would ask that Your Precious Blood would wash and cleanse every stain until it is in the seas of God's forgetfulness never to be remembered against me any more
The Louisiana presbytery of the Assemblies of God initially suspended Swaggart from the ministry for three months The national presbytery of the Assemblies of God soon extended the suspension to their standard two year suspension for sexual immorality His return to the pulpit coincided with the end of a three month suspension originally ordered by the denomination Believing that Swaggart was not genuinely repentant in submitting to their authority the hierarchy of the Assemblies of God defrocked him removing his credentials and ministerial license

On October Swaggart was found in the company of a prostitute for a second time He was pulled over by a police officer in Indio California for driving on the wrong side of the road With him in the vehicle was a woman named Rosemary Garcia According to Garcia Swaggart had stopped to propose sex to her on the side of the road She later told reporters He asked me for sex I mean that's why he stopped me That's what I do I'm a prostitute This time rather than confessing of his sins to his congregation Swaggart told those at Family Worship Center The Lord told me it's flat none of your business Swaggart's son Donnie then announced to the audience that his father would be temporarily stepping down as head of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries for a time of healing and counseling
