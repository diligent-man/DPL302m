being too poor to own a home the swaggarts lived in church basements homes of pastors and small motels
sun records producer sam phillips wanted to start a gospel line of music for the label perhaps to remain in competition with rca victor and columbia who also had gospel lines at the time and wanted swaggart for sun as the first gospel artist for the label
his cousin jerry lee lewis who had previously signed with sun was reportedly earning per week at the time
although the offer meant a promise for significant income for him and his family swaggart turned phillips down stating that he was called to preach the gospel
preaching from a flatbed trailer donated to him swaggart began full time evangelistic work in
he began developing a revival meeting following throughout the american south
in he began recording gospel music record albums and transmitting on christian radio stations
in swaggart was ordained by the assemblies of god a year later he began his radio ministry
the statement made above the television ministry which began in and originally known as the camp meeting hour is incorrect
the television ministry did begin in but it was never known as the campmeeting hour that was the name of swaggart s minute weekday radio program that began in
the two earliest tv programs were called the jimmy swaggart telecast minutes at first then minutes and a study in the word the minute weekday teaching program
in the late s swaggart founded what was then a small church named the family worship center in baton rouge louisiana the church eventually became district affiliated with the assemblies of god
in swaggart began transmitting a weekly minute telecast over various local television stations in baton rouge and also purchased a local am radio station wlux now wpfc
the station broadcast christian feature stories preaching and teaching to various fundamentalist and pentecostal denominations and playing black gospel southern gospel and inspirational music
as contemporary christian music became more prevalent the station avoided playing it
swaggart sold many of his radio stations gradually throughout the s and early s
jimmy swaggart ministries still operates several radio stations that operate under the name sonlife radio
however he is known for his cover of chuck girard s song sometimes alleluia which swaggart used as the theme to his weekly and flagship namesake program
girard himself being one of the pioneers of contemporary christian music
swaggart wrote a book religious rock n roll a wolf in sheep s clothing in
in his monthly periodical known as the evangelist he wrote against worldliness in worship music particularly referring to a carman concert
he also mentioned in the article that christian leaders were in terrible opposition with him for preaching the truth against contemporary christian music and its artists
swaggart has often preached that god does not borrow from the world to reach the youth but has since changed his position on contemporary christian music and has integrated its sound and style in his worship services such as hillsong
by the television ministry had expanded to more stations around the united states and he began to use television as his primary preaching forum
in the weekly telecast was increased to an hour
in swaggart began a daily weekday telecast featuring bible study and music and the weekend hour long telecast included a service from either family worship center swaggart s church or an on location crusade in a major city
in the early s the broadcasts expanded to major cities nationwide
by more than television stations broadcast the telecast
throughout the s jimmy swaggart ministries was one of many american evangelical leaders who promoted the south african backed mozambican national resistance aka renamo which was accused of committing systematic war crimes during mozambique s year long civil war
in addition to moral support and publicity swaggart ministries was repeatedly accused of providing funding and material support to the group
in september government forces supported by zimbabwe captured renamo s main hq inside mozambique casa banana in gorongosa district
among the materials left behind by retreating rebels were piles of swaggart s publication how to receive the baptism in the holy spirit translated into portuguese
during the trial of australian missionary ian grey who coordinated much of the private support to renamo it was claimed by the defendant that swaggart ministries worked through ex rhodesian soldier michael t howard s shekinah ministries to provide support to renamo
that year extensive media coverage of swaggart and his businesses in the wake of a sex scandal largely excluded these allegations
in covert action magazine and the government of zimbabwe both accused swaggart ministries of continuing to fund renamo
in swaggart was accused of a sex scandal involving a prostitute initially resulting in his suspension and ultimately defrocking by the assemblies of god
three years later swaggart was implicated in another scandal involving prostitution
as a result swaggart s ministry became nonaffiliated nondenominational and significantly smaller than it was in the ministry s pre scandal years
swaggart s first exposure was in retaliation for an incident in when he exposed fellow assemblies of god minister marvin gorman whom he accused of having several affairs
once he was exposed gorman was defrocked from the assemblies of god and his ministry was all but ended
gorman filed a successful lawsuit against swaggart for defamation and conspiracy to ruin his reputation which led to the award of damages amounting to million in reduced after an appeal and an out of court settlement to million
however as a retaliatory measure gorman hired his son randy and son in law garland bilbo to watch the travel inn on airline highway in metairie a suburb of new orleans
a camera with a telephoto lens was placed in the window of the motel s room and draped with a black cloth
when swaggart arrived he reportedly went into room
randy gorman and garland bilbo let the air out of the tires on swaggart s vehicle
they called marvin gorman whose church was located nearby
randy gorman and garland bilbo had taken photos of swaggart outside room with debra murphree a local prostitute
gorman arrived at the travel inn a short while later and confronted swaggart although on details accounts from both sides differed
according to swaggart the unauthorized biography of an american evangelist by ann rowe seaman gorman secured a promise from swaggart that he would publicly apologize to gorman and start the process of gorman s reinstatement to the assemblies of god
gorman offered to remain silent if swaggart would state publicly that he lied about gorman s affairs
gorman waited almost a year then hand delivered a note to swaggart informing him his time was up swaggart did not respond
on february gorman contacted james hamil one of the man executive presbytery of the assemblies of god who called g
raymond carlson the assemblies superintendent
carlson summoned hamill and gorman to fly to assemblies of god headquarters in springfield missouri and arranged for an emergency meeting of the presbyters
he was shown photos of several men coming in and going out of room at the travel inn motel in new orleans
this was done to establish that the room was being used for prostitution
one of the men shown leaving room was swaggart
the presbytery leadership of the assemblies of god decided that swaggart should be suspended from broadcasting his television program for three months
according to the associated press murphree who claimed to have posed nude for swaggart failed a polygraph test administered by a new york city police department polygraph expert
the test administrator concluded that murphree had failed to tell the truth on all key questions concerning her statement
the test was administered after murphree offered to sell the story to the national enquirer for
paul levy senior editor for the enquirer stated that the polygraph examiner had concluded murphree was not truthful on six key questions including one in which she was reportedly asked if she had fabricated the story
levy stated that the enquirer decided not to print her story due to the test results her drug use and the fact that she had arrest warrants in three states
murphree failed questions about whether she was paid or promised money to set up swaggart and whether she made up the story to make money from it
on february without giving any details regarding his transgressions swaggart delivered what came to be known as his i have sinned speech on live television
he spoke tearfully to his family congregation tv audience and ended it with a prayer i have sinned against you my lord and i would ask that your precious blood
would wash and cleanse every stain until it is in the seas of god s forgetfulness never to be remembered against me any more
the louisiana presbytery of the assemblies of god initially suspended swaggart from the ministry for three months
the national presbytery of the assemblies of god soon extended the suspension to their standard two year suspension for sexual immorality
his return to the pulpit coincided with the end of a three month suspension originally ordered by the denomination
believing that swaggart was not genuinely repentant in submitting to their authority the hierarchy of the assemblies of god defrocked him removing his credentials and ministerial license
swaggart then became an independent and non denominational pentecostal minister establishing jimmy swaggart ministries based at the family worship center in baton rouge louisiana and the sonlife broadcasting network sbn which can be seen in the united states and other countries
on october swaggart was found in the company of a prostitute for a second time
he was pulled over by a police officer in indio california for driving on the wrong side of the road
with him in the vehicle was a woman named rosemary garcia
according to garcia swaggart had stopped to propose sex to her on the side of the road
she later told reporters he asked me for sex
i mean that s why he stopped me
that s what i do
i m a prostitute this time rather than confessing of his sins to his congregation swaggart told those at family worship center the lord told me it s flat none of your business swaggart s son donnie then announced to the audience that his father would be temporarily stepping down as head of jimmy swaggart ministries for a time of healing and counseling
the scandals inspired the ozzy osbourne song miracle man on osbourne s album no rest for the wicked and a reference in the iron maiden song holy smoke a uk number three hit single from the album no prayer for the dying
during his concerts bruce hornsby would begin his song defenders of the flag from scenes from the southside with a tongue in cheek dedication to swaggart
similarities were also noted between heel world wrestling federation character brother love and swaggart s style of preaching
