The Embassy of the United States of America in Luxembourg City is the diplomatic mission on the United States in Luxembourg Since following the liberation of Luxembourg in World War II both the embassy and Ambassador's residence have been located in the Dolibois House named after John E Dolibois Ambassador to Luxembourg
steel magnate Alfred Lefevre and Albertine Reckinger purchased the property at Boulevard Emmanuel Servais and built a maison de maître — a grand family house Designed by Luxembourgish architect Gust Schopen the house's opulence reflected the wealth Luxembourg’s steel industry centered in Esch sur Alzette However for unknown reasons the Lefevres never inhabited their new estate and in sold it to the German government who used it as their embassy
At am on May Nazi Germany invaded Luxembourg Within hours the tiny nation had been annexed entirely Adolf Hitler then appointed Gustaf Simon as gauleiter governor and he set up base at the Lefevre mansion Simon began a campaign to wipe out Luxembourgish language and culture all the while hosting such names as composer Richard Strauss at the residence
On September the United States Army liberated Luxembourg City The Lefevre house in the meanwhile was used as barracks for American soldiers In the days following the Battle of the Bulge the American Chargé d'Affaires to Luxembourg George Platt Waller returned after having been forced out in reestablishing the diplomatic connection between the US and Luxembourg
Just before leaving Luxembourg permanently Chargé Waller signed the papers sealing the purchase of the Lefevre mansion from the Luxembourgish government on June for million in dollars In fact the American government got the property for free as Belgium covered the cost as part of its repayment to the United States under the Lend Lease program
The Embassy in Luxembourg has been the home of several 'first of their kind' US ambassadors including Perle Mesta one of the first female ambassadors Patricia Roberts Harris the first African American female ambassador and John E Dolibois the first and only native born Luxembourger Indeed of such quality was his service that in October the United States Senate passed a resolution officially naming the embassy building the Dolibois House in his honor
In June the Luxembourg embassy along with several other American diplomatic missions flew the rainbow flag in honor of LGBT Pride Month which was officially endorsed by US President Barack Obama
