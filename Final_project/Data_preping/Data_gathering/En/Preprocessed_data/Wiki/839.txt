In calculus the constant of integration often denoted by
is a constant term added to an antiderivative of a function
to indicate that the indefinite integral of
i e the set of all antiderivatives of
on a connected domain is only defined up to an additive constant This constant expresses an ambiguity inherent in the construction of antiderivatives
More specifically if a function
is defined on an interval and
then the set of all antiderivatives of
is given by the functions
is an arbitrary constant meaning that any value of
a valid antiderivative For that reason the indefinite integral is often written as
textstyle int f x dx F x C
although the constant of integration might be sometimes omitted in lists of integrals for simplicity
The derivative of any constant function is zero Once one has found one antiderivative
adding or subtracting any constant
will give us another antiderivative because
textstyle frac d dx F x C frac d dx F x frac d dx C F' x f x
The constant is a way of expressing that every function with at least one antiderivative will have an infinite number of them

displaystyle G mathbb R to mathbb R
be two everywhere differentiable functions Suppose that
displaystyle F ' x G ' x
for every real number x Then there exists a real number
displaystyle F x G x C
for every real number x
To prove this notice that
displaystyle F x G x '
making the goal to prove that an everywhere differentiable function whose derivative is always zero must be constant
For any x the fundamental theorem of calculus together with the assumption that the derivative of

Two facts are crucial in this proof First the real line is connected If the real line were not connected we would not always be able to integrate from our fixed a to any given x For example if we were to ask for functions defined on the union of intervals and and if a were then it would not be possible to integrate from to because the function is not defined between and Here there will be two constants one for each connected component of the domain In general by replacing constants with locally constant functions we can extend this theorem to disconnected domains For example there are two constants of integration for
textstyle int tan x dx
so for example the general form for the integral of x is
displaystyle int frac dx x begin cases ln left x right C x ln left x right C x end cases
were assumed to be everywhere differentiable If
are not differentiable at even one point then the theorem might fail As an example let
be the Heaviside step function which is zero for negative values of x and one for non negative values of x and let
is zero where it is defined and the derivative of
is always zero Yet it's clear that
do not differ by a constant even if it is assumed that
are everywhere continuous and almost everywhere differentiable the theorem still fails As an example take
to be the Cantor function and again let
For example suppose one wants to find antiderivatives of
Each of these has derivative
so they are all antiderivatives of
It turns out that adding and subtracting constants is the only flexibility we have in finding different antiderivatives of the same function That is all antiderivatives are the same up to a constant To express this fact for
displaystyle int cos x dx sin x C
by a number will produce an antiderivative By writing
instead of a number however a compact description of all the possible antiderivatives of
is called the constant of integration It is easily determined that all of these functions are indeed antiderivatives of
displaystyle begin aligned frac d dx sin x C frac d dx sin x frac d dx C cos x cos x end aligned
At first glance it may seem that the constant is unnecessary since it can be set to zero Furthermore when evaluating definite integrals using the fundamental theorem of calculus the constant will always cancel with itself
However trying to set the constant to zero does not always make sense For example
displaystyle sin x cos x
can be integrated in at least three different ways
displaystyle begin aligned int sin x cos x dx sin x C cos x C frac cos x C int sin x cos x dx cos x C sin x C frac cos x C int sin x cos x dx frac cos x C sin x C cos x C end aligned
to zero can still leave a constant This means that for a given function there is no simplest antiderivative
equal to zero is that sometimes we want to find an antiderivative that has a given value at a given point as in an initial value problem For example to obtain the antiderivative of
that has the value at x then only one value of
will work in this case
This restriction can be rephrased in the language of differential equations Finding an indefinite integral of a function
is the same as solving the differential equation
textstyle frac dy dx f x
Any differential equation will have many solutions and each constant represents the unique solution of a well posed initial value problem Imposing the condition that our antiderivative takes the value at x is an initial condition Each initial condition corresponds to one and only one value of
it would be impossible to solve the problem
There is another justification coming from abstract algebra The space of all suitable real valued functions on the real numbers is a vector space and the differential operator
is a linear operator The operator
maps a function to zero if and only if that function is constant Consequently the kernel of
is the space of all constant functions The process of indefinite integration amounts to finding a pre image of a given function There is no canonical pre image for a given function but the set of all such pre images forms a coset Choosing a constant is the same as choosing an element of the coset In this context solving an initial value problem is interpreted as lying in the hyperplane given by the initial conditions
