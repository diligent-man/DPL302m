although constant integration might sometimes omitted list integral simplicity
constant way expressing every function least one antiderivative infinite number them
making goal prove everywhere differentiable function whose derivative always zero must constant
x fundamental theorem calculus together assumption derivative of
real line connected would always able integrate fixed given x
example ask function defined union interval would possible integrate function defined and
general replacing constant locally constant function extend theorem disconnected domains
heaviside step function zero negative value x one non-negative value x let
everywhere continuous almost everywhere differentiable theorem still fails
turn adding subtracting constant flexibility finding different antiderivatives function
instead number however compact description possible antiderivatives of
first glance may seem constant unnecessary since set zero
furthermore evaluating definite integral using fundamental theorem calculus constant always cancel itself
however trying set constant zero doe always make sense
