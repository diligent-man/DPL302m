in calculus the constant of integration often denoted by
displaystyle c
is a constant term added to an antiderivative of a function
displaystyle f x
to indicate that the indefinite integral of
displaystyle f x
i e the set of all antiderivatives of
displaystyle f x
on a connected domain is only defined up to an additive constant
this constant expresses an ambiguity inherent in the construction of antiderivatives
more specifically if a function
displaystyle f x
is defined on an interval and
displaystyle f x
is an antiderivative of
displaystyle f x
then the set of all antiderivatives of
displaystyle f x
is given by the functions
displaystyle f x c
where
displaystyle c
is an arbitrary constant meaning that any value of
displaystyle c
would make
displaystyle f x c
a valid antiderivative
for that reason the indefinite integral is often written as
textstyle int f x dx f x c
although the constant of integration might be sometimes omitted in lists of integrals for simplicity
the derivative of any constant function is zero
once one has found one antiderivative
displaystyle f x
for a function
displaystyle f x
adding or subtracting any constant
displaystyle c
will give us another antiderivative because
textstyle frac d dx f x c frac d dx f x frac d dx c f x f x
the constant is a way of expressing that every function with at least one antiderivative will have an infinite number of them
displaystyle f mathbb r to mathbb r
displaystyle g mathbb r to mathbb r
be two everywhere differentiable functions
suppose that
displaystyle f x g x
for every real number x
then there exists a real number
displaystyle c
such that
displaystyle f x g x c
for every real number x
to prove this notice that
displaystyle f x g x
displaystyle f
can be replaced by
displaystyle f g
displaystyle g
by the constant function
displaystyle
making the goal to prove that an everywhere differentiable function whose derivative is always zero must be constant
choose a real number
displaystyle a
and let
displaystyle c f a
for any x the fundamental theorem of calculus together with the assumption that the derivative of
displaystyle f
vanishes implies that
displaystyle begin aligned int a x f t dt f x f a f x c f x c end aligned
thereby showing that
displaystyle f
is a constant function
two facts are crucial in this proof
first the real line is connected
if the real line were not connected we would not always be able to integrate from our fixed a to any given x
for example if we were to ask for functions defined on the union of intervals and and if a were then it would not be possible to integrate from to because the function is not defined between and
here there will be two constants one for each connected component of the domain
in general by replacing constants with locally constant functions we can extend this theorem to disconnected domains
for example there are two constants of integration for
textstyle int dx x
and infinitely many for
textstyle int tan x dx
so for example the general form for the integral of x is
displaystyle int frac dx x begin cases ln left x right c x ln left x right c x end cases
second
displaystyle f
displaystyle g
were assumed to be everywhere differentiable
displaystyle f
displaystyle g
are not differentiable at even one point then the theorem might fail
as an example let
displaystyle f x
be the heaviside step function which is zero for negative values of x and one for non negative values of x and let
displaystyle g x
then the derivative of
displaystyle f
is zero where it is defined and the derivative of
displaystyle g
is always zero
yet it s clear that
displaystyle f
displaystyle g
do not differ by a constant even if it is assumed that
displaystyle f
displaystyle g
are everywhere continuous and almost everywhere differentiable the theorem still fails
as an example take
displaystyle f
to be the cantor function and again let
displaystyle g
for example suppose one wants to find antiderivatives of
displaystyle cos x
one such antiderivative is
displaystyle sin x
another one is
displaystyle sin x
a third is
displaystyle sin x pi
each of these has derivative
displaystyle cos x
so they are all antiderivatives of
displaystyle cos x
it turns out that adding and subtracting constants is the only flexibility we have in finding different antiderivatives of the same function
that is all antiderivatives are the same up to a constant
to express this fact for
displaystyle cos x
we write
displaystyle int cos x dx sin x c
replacing
displaystyle c
by a number will produce an antiderivative
by writing
displaystyle c
instead of a number however a compact description of all the possible antiderivatives of
displaystyle cos x
is obtained
displaystyle c
is called the constant of integration
it is easily determined that all of these functions are indeed antiderivatives of
displaystyle cos x
displaystyle begin aligned frac d dx sin x c frac d dx sin x frac d dx c cos x cos x end aligned
at first glance it may seem that the constant is unnecessary since it can be set to zero
furthermore when evaluating definite integrals using the fundamental theorem of calculus the constant will always cancel with itself
however trying to set the constant to zero does not always make sense
for example
displaystyle sin x cos x
can be integrated in at least three different ways
displaystyle begin aligned int sin x cos x dx sin x c cos x c frac cos x c int sin x cos x dx cos x c sin x c frac cos x c int sin x cos x dx frac cos x c sin x c cos x c end aligned
so setting
displaystyle c
to zero can still leave a constant
this means that for a given function there is no simplest antiderivative
another problem with setting
displaystyle c
equal to zero is that sometimes we want to find an antiderivative that has a given value at a given point as in an initial value problem
for example to obtain the antiderivative of
displaystyle cos x
that has the value at x then only one value of
displaystyle c
will work in this case
displaystyle c
this restriction can be rephrased in the language of differential equations
finding an indefinite integral of a function
displaystyle f x
is the same as solving the differential equation
textstyle frac dy dx f x
any differential equation will have many solutions and each constant represents the unique solution of a well posed initial value problem
imposing the condition that our antiderivative takes the value at x is an initial condition
each initial condition corresponds to one and only one value of
displaystyle c
so without
displaystyle c
it would be impossible to solve the problem
there is another justification coming from abstract algebra
the space of all suitable real valued functions on the real numbers is a vector space and the differential operator
textstyle frac d dx
is a linear operator
the operator
textstyle frac d dx
maps a function to zero if and only if that function is constant
consequently the kernel of
textstyle frac d dx
is the space of all constant functions
the process of indefinite integration amounts to finding a pre image of a given function
there is no canonical pre image for a given function but the set of all such pre images forms a coset
choosing a constant is the same as choosing an element of the coset
in this context solving an initial value problem is interpreted as lying in the hyperplane given by the initial conditions
