The history of science and technology HST is a field of history that examines the understanding of the natural world science and the ability to manipulate it technology at different points in time This academic discipline also studies the cultural economic and political impacts of and contexts for scientific practices
History of science is an academic discipline with an international community of specialists Main professional organizations for this field include the History of Science Society the British Society for the History of Science and the European Society for the History of Science
Much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science is how it functions and whether it exhibits large scale patterns and trends
Histories of science were originally written by practicing and retired scientists starting primarily with William Whewell's History of the Inductive Sciences as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public
Auguste Comte proposed that there should be a specific discipline to deal with the history of science
The development of the distinct academic discipline of the history of science and technology did not occur until the early th century Historians have suggested that this was bound to the changing role of science during the same time period
After World War II extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world
In the decades since the end of World War II history of science became an academic discipline with graduate schools research institutes public and private patronage peer reviewed journals and professional societies
In the United States a more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was initiated by George Sarton's publications Introduction to the History of Science and the journal Isis founded in Sarton exemplified the early th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress
The study of the history of science continued to be a small effort until the rise of Big Science after World War II With the work of I Bernard Cohen at Harvard the history of science began to become an established subdiscipline of history in the United States
In the United States the influential bureaucrat Vannevar Bush and the president of Harvard James Conant both encouraged the study of the history of science as a way of improving general knowledge about how science worked and why it was essential to maintain a large scientific workforce
