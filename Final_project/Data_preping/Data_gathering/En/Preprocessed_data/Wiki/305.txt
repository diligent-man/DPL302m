much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science is how it functions and whether it exhibits large scale patterns and trends
histories of science were originally written by practicing and retired scientists starting primarily with william whewell s history of the inductive sciences as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public
auguste comte proposed that there should be a specific discipline to deal with the history of science
the development of the distinct academic discipline of the history of science and technology did not occur until the early th century
historians have suggested that this was bound to the changing role of science during the same time period
after world war ii extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both science and technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world
in the decades since the end of world war ii history of science became an academic discipline with graduate schools research institutes public and private patronage peer reviewed journals and professional societies
in the united states a more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was initiated by george sarton s publications introduction to the history of science and the journal isis founded in
sarton exemplified the early th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas
he shared with many of his contemporaries a whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress
the study of the history of science continued to be a small effort until the rise of big science after world war ii
with the work of i
