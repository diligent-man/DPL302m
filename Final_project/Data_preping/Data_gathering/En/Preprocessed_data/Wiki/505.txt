the wbz fm studios are located at the morrissey boulevard in dorchester while the station transmitter resides in the boston suburb of newton
in addition to a standard analog transmission wbz fm broadcasts over two hd radio channels and is available online
despite the call sign wbz fm has no connection to either wbz tv or wbz wbz tv owner paramount global holds the trademark for wbz and has licensed the rights to the wbz call letters to beasley under a long term agreement that followed cbs corporation s divestiture of cbs radio wbz fm s previous owner to entercom
the station signed on in october as wnac fm under the ownership of the yankee network division of general tire and rubber which also owned wnac am and wnac tv channel now occupied by whdh
the station originally transmitted from wnac tv s tower in medford using a transmitter originally used for wmne the yankee network s fm station on mount washington which was originally considered a boston station but was eventually refocused to portland maine which operated from december to september when it signed off due to increasing costs and a lack of listener interest
as at most fm stations wnac fm initially served as a full time simulcast of wnac
the station along with general tire s other broadcast holdings came under the general teleradio banner in the division became rko teleradio pictures in and rko general by december
in may general teleradio bought wlaw am and wlaw fm fm from hildreth and rogers publishers of the lawrence daily eagle and evening tribune for
the deal was made to facilitate a move of the wnac call letters and programming onto wlaw s signal as wnac am to comply with existing fcc ownership regulations wnac was spun off to vic diehm and associates and became wvda wlaw fm had its license surrendered in the transaction as wnac fm was retained
on may the call sign was changed to wrko fm even though the station was still simulcasting wnac as rko teleradio sought to keep the wrko call letters out of the hands of its competitors
while separate programming was inaugurated for half of the broadcast day in due to then upcoming federal communications commission fcc regulations prohibiting am and fm stations from simulcasting for more than half of the day this programming was initially a middle of the road format identical to that of wnac
a year later wrko fm along with wnac tv moved to a new tower in newton
on october wrko fm dropped its simulcast of wnac by then predominantly a talk station and introduced a top format reliant on automation
playing the top hits of the day including the number one song in boston every hour on the hour and using recorded announcing altered to sound like a robot since the station was positioned as r ko pronounced arko the shy but friendly robot wrko fm quickly became the most popular fm radio station in the boston area
as a result of this success when wnac dropped its talk format in favor of a live top format on march rko general changed its call letters to wrko
its programming was then simulcast on wrko fm from a m
to p m with the r ko programming continuing for the rest of the day
wrko fm s top programming came to an end in november when it joined sister stations khj fm in los angeles and kfrc fm in san francisco in airing an automated soft rock format from drake chenault enterprises hit parade which incorporated both current music and oldies
a month earlier on october the station changed its call sign to wror as part an effort by rko general to give their fm stations a distinct identity from their am sister stations
wror switched to another drake chenault format solid gold rock and roll on november evenly splitting the oldies and current music
rko general reached a tentative deal to sell off wror to cecil heftel and his wife joyce heftel for million in august
while approved by the fcc the agency concurrently rejected a secondary agreement between heftel and the boston community media committee whereupon heftel would make programming and minority employment commitments for wror in exchange for an annual payment to the bcmc of or of wror s before tax profits whichever was greater
the bcmc and another boston citizens group opposed to the transaction subsequently filed challenges that led to a lengthy delay resulting in rko and heftel mutually agreeing to terminate the sale
in early wror went to a full time oldies format still playing a new song per hour and a couple recent hits an hour eventually parting ways with drake chenault later that year and adopting the name the golden great drake chenault s services were later utilized by wcop fm now wzlx which competed with wror in the oldies format from to
starting in march wror gradually began to position the station as an ac station rather than oldies and by september was more of a gold based adult contemporary station leading to its branding changing to the great and then and a half station management felt that there was a hole in the market for an fm ac station to compete against wbz and whdh now weei
still the station was mostly oldies from the s playing a couple currents and a couple recent hits an hour plus a couple of pre oldies as well
after rko general lost its license to operate wnac tv in wror was forced to move to another tower in newton as the new owners of channel renamed wnev tv did not lease space on its tower
however in the wake of the loss of the license the fcc announced in february that it would solicit competing applications for rko s remaining stations including wror
finally fcc administrative law judge edward kuhlmann ruled on august that wror s license along with all of rko general s broadcast licenses be denied renewal while parent company gencorp initially appealed the ruling the company was advised by the fcc that any appeal would be denied and that to avoid the indignity of further license forfeitures without compensation their stations should be divested instead
in the station along with wrko was acquired by atlantic ventures for million split between gencorp and the challengers for the licenses
during the s wror continued as a gold based ac station throughout the week
the station played one to two currents an hour that were huge hits
they played several s songs an hour and several s songs an hour
nearly half the songs played were from the s along with a pre oldie an hour
on weekends the station played strictly oldies mostly from the s with a couple of early s songs an hour plus several pre oldies as well
for a few months late in and early in wror ran a smooth jazz new age music show in the evening
in wror modified its oldies ac format to bright adult contemporary and changed its on air identity to ror fm the station discontinued its the oldies weekends began playing more currents eliminated nearly all pre oldies and focused on s and s music despite these changes wror continued to air its saturday night oldies show
however after finding that listeners continued to perceive wror as an oldies station atlantic ventures decided to relaunch the station under a new identity
at noon on february after playing roy orbison s it s over the station became mix and shifted closer to a rhythmic leaning hot adult contemporary format heavy on motown oldies and hot ac currents
the first song on mix was i can t help myself by the four tops
a few weeks later on february the station took the wbmx call letters from an am station in zeeland michigan which had been using them since signing on the previous year this am station received the wror calls in return
barry scott and the lost s retro radio show was a sunday night staple before moving to wods
the wror fm call letters are now used on a classic hits station in boston at fm owned by beasley broadcast group
atlantic ventures merged with two other radio groups stoner broadcasting systems and multi market communications on june to form american radio systems ars
in the following years like many hot ac stations wbmx began to emphasize more modern rock music to the exclusion of the remaining oldies and was considered one of the first modern adult contemporary stations in the country
american radio systems announced a merger with cbs radio in
wbmx was the company s only boston station to be acquired by cbs in the deal completed in june owing to cbs existing presence in the market ars other boston stations were required to be sold off by either the fcc or the department of justice doj
cbs radio stations including wbmx were spun off into a new public company infinity broadcasting corporation in viacom announced its acquisition of the publicly held stake in infinity on august shortly after it merged with cbs corporation a transaction completed on february though viacom and cbs before the merger had always held a majority stake in infinity
when viacom split into two companies on december infinity became part of the new cbs corporation and reverted to the cbs radio name
on july cbs radio announced that it would change wbmx s format to sports radio under the the sports hub branding and change call letters to wbz fm this would be the third distinct usage of the wbz calls on the fm dial in boston having previously been used on an experimental fm station from to and again on the current wmjx from to
in addition cbs announced that the wbmx call letters hot ac format and mix branding and intellectual properties would move to fm as mix replacing wbcn on august
the next day the sports talk format officially launched on
ahead of the changes wbmx added an fm suffix to its call sign on july allowing cbs to place the call sign on an am station it owned in charlotte north carolina then changed to wbz fm on august a week before the launch of the sports hub
wbcn s active rock format was re established on an hd radio subchannel of wbz fm branded as wbcn its call sign was parked on the charlotte station in a swap with
with the sports format s launch wbz fm became the flagship for the boston bruins radio network taking those duties from wbz in addition to becoming the flagship for the new england patriots radio network assuming those play by play rights from the former wbcn wbcn s morning show toucher and rich was also moved over to wbz fm in the same time slot
within two years of wbz fm s launch the sports hub outrated weei am the longer established sports station in the boston market in three key male demographics this led weei s owner entercom to move its programming to fm in september
on february cbs announced that they would be selling their radio division to entercom which could have made wbz fm a direct sister to weei
the sale would be conducted using a reverse morris trust so that it would be tax free
while cbs shareholders retain a ownership stake in the combined company entercom was the surviving entity separating both wbz and wbz fm from wbz tv and wsbk tv
however the combined company would have to shed some of its boston stations in order to satisfy fcc and doj requirements
on october cbs disclosed that as part of the process of obtaining regulatory approval of the merger wbz fm would be one of sixteen stations that would be divested by entercom along with sister stations wbz and wzlx and entercom stations wrko and wkaf with entercom retaining weei am and fm wbmx wods and waaf
