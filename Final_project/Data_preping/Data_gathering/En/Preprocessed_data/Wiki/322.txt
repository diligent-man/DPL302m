unemployment according to the oecd organisation for economic co operation and development is people above a specified age usually not being in paid employment or self employment but currently available for work during the reference period
unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the labour force the total number of people employed added to those unemployed
unemployment can have many sources such as the following
new technologies and inventions
the status of the economy which can be influenced by a recession
competition caused by globalization and international trade
policies of the government
regulation and marketunemployment and the status of the economy can be influenced by a country through for example fiscal policy
furthermore the monetary authority of a country such as the central bank can influence the availability and cost for money through its monetary policy
in addition to theories of unemployment a few categorisations of unemployment are used for more precisely modelling the effects of unemployment within the economic system
some of the main types of unemployment include structural unemployment frictional unemployment cyclical unemployment involuntary unemployment and classical unemployment
structural unemployment focuses on foundational problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labor markets including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets
structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to disruptive technologies and globalization
discussions of frictional unemployment focus on voluntary decisions to work based on individuals valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates added to the time and effort required to find a job
causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates
according to the un s international labour organization ilo there were million people worldwide or of the reported global workforce without work in
because of the difficulty in measuring the unemployment rate by for example using surveys as in the united states or through registered unemployed citizens as in some european countries statistical figures such as the employment to population ratio might be more suitable for evaluating the status of the workforce and the economy if they were based on people who are registered for example as taxpayers
the state of being without any work yet looking for work is called unemployment
economists distinguish between various overlapping types of and theories of unemployment including cyclical or keynesian unemployment frictional unemployment structural unemployment and classical unemployment
some additional types of unemployment that are occasionally mentioned are seasonal unemployment hardcore unemployment and hidden unemployment
though there have been several definitions of voluntary and involuntary unemployment in the economics literature a simple distinction is often applied
voluntary unemployment is attributed to the individual s decisions but involuntary unemployment exists because of the socio economic environment including the market structure government intervention and the level of aggregate demand in which individuals operate
in these terms much or most of frictional unemployment is voluntary since it reflects individual search behavior
voluntary unemployment includes workers who reject low wage jobs but involuntary unemployment includes workers fired because of an economic crisis industrial decline company bankruptcy or organizational restructuring
on the other hand cyclical unemployment structural unemployment and classical unemployment are largely involuntary in nature
however the existence of structural unemployment may reflect choices made by the unemployed in the past and classical natural unemployment may result from the legislative and economic choices made by labour unions or political parties
the clearest cases of involuntary unemployment are those with fewer job vacancies than unemployed workers even when wages are allowed to adjust and so even if all vacancies were to be filled some unemployed workers would still remain
that happens with cyclical unemployment as macroeconomic forces cause microeconomic unemployment which can boomerang back and exacerbate those macroeconomic forces
classical natural or real wage unemployment occurs when real wages for a job are set above the market clearing level causing the number of job seekers to exceed the number of vacancies
on the other hand most economists argue that as wages fall below a livable wage many choose to drop out of the labour market and no longer seek employment
that is especially true in countries in which low income families are supported through public welfare systems
in such cases wages would have to be high enough to motivate people to choose employment over what they receive through public welfare
wages below a livable wage are likely to result in lower labor market participation in the above stated scenario
in addition consumption of goods and services is the primary driver of increased demand for labor
higher wages lead to workers having more income available to consume goods and services
therefore higher wages increase general consumption and as a result demand for labor increases and unemployment decreases
many economists have argued that unemployment increases with increased governmental regulation
for example minimum wage laws raise the cost of some low skill laborers above market equilibrium resulting in increased unemployment as people who wish to work at the going rate cannot as the new and higher enforced wage is now greater than the value of their labour
laws restricting layoffs may make businesses less likely to hire in the first place as hiring becomes more risky
however that argument overly simplifies the relationship between wage rates and unemployment by ignoring numerous factors that contribute to unemployment
some such as murray rothbard suggest that even social taboos can prevent wages from falling to the market clearing level
in out of work unemployment and government in the twentieth century america economists richard vedder and lowell gallaway argue that the empirical record of wages rates productivity and unemployment in america validates classical unemployment theory
their data shows a strong correlation between adjusted real wage and unemployment in the united states from to
however they maintain that their data does not take into account exogenous events
cyclical deficient demand or keynesian unemployment occurs when there is not enough aggregate demand in the economy to provide jobs for everyone who wants to work
demand for most goods and services falls less production is needed and consequently fewer workers are needed wages are sticky and do not fall to meet the equilibrium level and unemployment results
its name is derived from the frequent ups and downs in the business cycle but unemployment can also be persistent such as during the great depression
with cyclical unemployment the number of unemployed workers exceeds the number of job vacancies and so even if all open jobs were filled some workers would still remain unemployed
some associate cyclical unemployment with frictional unemployment because the factors that cause the friction are partially caused by cyclical variables
for example a surprise decrease in the money supply may suddenly inhibit aggregate demand and thus inhibit labor demand
keynesian economists on the other hand see the lack of supply of jobs as potentially resolvable by government intervention
one suggested intervention involves deficit spending to boost employment and goods demand
another intervention involves an expansionary monetary policy to increase the supply of money which should reduce interest rates which in turn should lead to an increase in non governmental spending
in demand based theory it is possible to abolish cyclical unemployment by increasing the aggregate demand for products and workers
however the economy eventually hits an inflation barrier that is imposed by the four other kinds of unemployment to the extent that they exist
historical experience suggests that low unemployment affects inflation in the short term but not the long term
in the long term the velocity of money supply measures such as the mzm money zero maturity representing cash and equivalent demand deposits velocity is far more predictive of inflation than low unemployment
some demand theory economists see the inflation barrier as corresponding to the natural rate of unemployment
the natural rate of unemployment is defined as the rate of unemployment that exists when the labour market is in equilibrium and there is pressure for neither rising inflation rates nor falling inflation rates
an alternative technical term for that rate is the nairu the non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment
whatever its name demand theory holds that if the unemployment rate gets too low inflation will accelerate in the absence of wage and price controls incomes policies
one of the major problems with the nairu theory is that no one knows exactly what the nairu is and it clearly changes over time
the margin of error can be quite high relative to the actual unemployment rate making it hard to use the nairu in policy making
another normative definition of full employment might be called the ideal unemployment rate
it would exclude all types of unemployment that represent forms of inefficiency
this type of full employment unemployment would correspond to only frictional unemployment excluding that part encouraging the mcjobs management strategy and so would be very low
however it would be impossible to attain this full employment target using only demand side keynesian stimulus without getting below the nairu and causing accelerating inflation absent incomes policies
training programs aimed at fighting structural unemployment would help here
to the extent that hidden unemployment exists it implies that official unemployment statistics provide a poor guide to what unemployment rate coincides with full employment
structural unemployment occurs when a labour market is unable to provide jobs for everyone who wants one because there is a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed workers and the skills needed for the available jobs
structural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from frictional unemployment except that it lasts longer
as with frictional unemployment simple demand side stimulus will not work to abolish this type of unemployment easily
structural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent cyclical unemployment if an economy suffers from longlasting low aggregate demand it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened and their skills including job searching skills become rusty and obsolete
problems with debt may lead to homelessness and a fall into the vicious circle of poverty
that means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers
the implication is that sustained high demand may lower structural unemployment
this theory of persistence in structural unemployment has been referred to as an example of path dependence or hysteresis
much technological unemployment caused by the replacement of workers by machines might be counted as structural unemployment
alternatively technological unemployment might refer to the way in which steady increases in labour productivity mean that fewer workers are needed to produce the same level of output every year
the fact that aggregate demand can be raised to deal with the problem suggests that the problem is instead one of cyclical unemployment
as indicated by okun s law the demand side must grow sufficiently quickly to absorb not only the growing labour force but also the workers who are made redundant by the increased labour productivity
seasonal unemployment may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment since it is linked to certain kinds of jobs construction and migratory farm work
the most cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using seasonal adjustment techniques
that results in substantial and permanent structural unemployment
frictional unemployment is the time period between jobs in which a worker searches for or transitions from one job to another
it is sometimes called search unemployment and can be voluntary based on the circumstances of the unemployed individual
frictional unemployment exists because both jobs and workers are heterogeneous and a mismatch can result between the characteristics of supply and demand
such a mismatch can be related to skills payment work time location seasonal industries attitude taste and a multitude of other factors
new entrants such as graduating students and re entrants such as former homemakers can also suffer a spell of frictional unemployment
workers and employers accept a certain level of imperfection risk or compromise but usually not right away
they will invest some time and effort to find a better match
that is in fact beneficial to the economy since it results in a better allocation of resources
however if the search takes too long and mismatches are too frequent the economy suffers since some work will not get done
therefore governments will seek ways to reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment by multiple means including providing education advice training and assistance such as daycare centers
the frictions in the labour market are sometimes illustrated graphically with a beveridge curve a downward sloping convex curve that shows a correlation between the unemployment rate on one axis and the vacancy rate on the other
changes in the supply of or demand for labour cause movements along the curve
an increase or decrease in labour market frictions will shift the curve outwards or inwards
official statistics often underestimate unemployment rates because of hidden or covered unemployment
that is the unemployment of potential workers that are not reflected in official unemployment statistics because of how the statistics are collected
in many countries only those who have no work but are actively looking for work and or qualifying for social security benefits are counted as unemployed
those who have given up looking for work and sometimes those who are on government retraining programs are not officially counted among the unemployed even though they are not employed
the statistic also does not count the underemployed those working fewer hours than they would prefer or in a job that fails to make good use of their capabilities
in addition those who are of working age but are currently in full time education are usually not considered unemployed in government statistics
traditional unemployed native societies who survive by gathering hunting herding and farming in wilderness areas may or may not be counted in unemployment statistics
long term unemployment ltu is defined in european union statistics as unemployment lasting for longer than one year while unemployment lasting over two years is defined as very long term unemployment
the united states bureau of labor statistics bls which reports current long term unemployment rate at percent defines this as unemployment lasting weeks or longer
long term unemployment is a component of structural unemployment which results in long term unemployment existing in every social group industry occupation and all levels of education
in the european commission published recommendations on how to reduce long term unemployment
these advised governments to
encourage long term unemployed people to register with an employment service
provide each registered long term unemployed person with an individual in depth assessment to identify their needs and potential within months
offer a tailor made job integration agreement jia to all registered long term unemployed within months
these might include measures such as mentoring help with job search further education and training support for housing transport child and care services and rehabilitation
each person would have a single point of contact to access this support which would be implemented in partnership with employers in it implemented the long term unemployment project to research solutions implemented by eu member states and produce a toolkit to guide government action
progress was evaluated in
marxists share the keynesian viewpoint of the relationship between economic demand and employment but with the caveat that the market system s propensity to slash wages and reduce labor participation on an enterprise level causes a requisite decrease in aggregate demand in the economy as a whole causing crises of unemployment and periods of low economic activity before the capital accumulation investment phase of economic growth can continue
according to karl marx unemployment is inherent within the unstable capitalist system and periodic crises of mass unemployment are to be expected
he theorized that unemployment was inevitable and even a necessary part of the capitalist system with recovery and regrowth also part of the process
the function of the proletariat within the capitalist system is to provide a reserve army of labour that creates downward pressure on wages
this is accomplished by dividing the proletariat into surplus labour employees and under employment unemployed
this reserve army of labour fight among themselves for scarce jobs at lower and lower wages
at first glance unemployment seems inefficient since unemployed workers do not increase profits but unemployment is profitable within the global capitalist system because unemployment lowers wages which are costs from the perspective of the owners
from this perspective low wages benefit the system by reducing economic rents
yet it does not benefit workers according to karl marx the workers proletariat work to benefit the bourgeoisie through their production of capital
capitalist systems unfairly manipulate the market for labour by perpetuating unemployment which lowers laborers demands for fair wages
workers are pitted against one another at the service of increasing profits for owners
as a result of the capitalist mode of production marx argued that workers experienced alienation and estrangement through their economic identity
according to marx the only way to permanently eliminate unemployment would be to abolish capitalism and the system of forced competition for wages and then shift to a socialist or communist economic system
for contemporary marxists the existence of persistent unemployment is proof of the inability of capitalism to ensure full employment
there are also different ways national statistical agencies measure unemployment
the differences may limit the validity of international comparisons of unemployment data
to some degree the differences remain despite national statistical agencies increasingly adopting the definition of unemployment of the international labour organization
to facilitate international comparisons some organizations such as the oecd eurostat and international labor comparisons program adjust data on unemployment for comparability across countries
though many people care about the number of unemployed individuals economists typically focus on the unemployment rate which corrects for the normal increase in the number of people employed caused by increases in population and increases in the labour force relative to the population
the unemployment rate is expressed as a percentage and calculated as follows
unemployment rate
unemployed workers
total labor force
displaystyle text unemployment rate frac text unemployed workers text total labor force times
as defined by the international labour organization unemployed workers are those who are currently not working but are willing and able to work for pay currently available to work and have actively searched for work
individuals who are actively seeking job placement must make the effort to be in contact with an employer have job interviews contact job placement agencies send out resumes submit applications respond to advertisements or some other means of active job searching within the prior four weeks
simply looking at advertisements and not responding will not count as actively seeking job placement
since not all unemployment may be open and counted by government agencies official statistics on unemployment may not be accurate
in the united states for example the unemployment rate does not take into consideration those individuals who are not actively looking for employment such as those who are still attending college
according to the oecd eurostat and the us bureau of labor statistics the unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force
an unemployed person is defined by eurostat according to the guidelines of the international labour organization as
someone aged to in italy spain the united kingdom iceland norway to years
without work during the reference week
available to start work within the next two weeks or has already found a job to start within the next three months
actively having sought employment at some time during the last four weeks the labour force or workforce includes both employed employees and self employed and unemployed people but not the economically inactive such as pre school children school children students and pensioners
the unemployment rate of an individual country is usually calculated and reported on a monthly quarterly and yearly basis by the national agency of statistics
organisations like the oecd report statistics for all of its member states
certain countries provide unemployment compensation for a certain period of time for unemployed citizens who are registered as unemployed at the government employment agency
furthermore pension receivables or claims could depend on the registration at the government employment agency
in many countries like in germany the unemployment rate is based on the number of people who are registered as unemployed
other countries like the united states use a labour force survey to calculate the unemployment rate
the ilo describes four different methods to calculate the unemployment rate
labour force sample surveys are the most preferred method of unemployment rate calculation since they give the most comprehensive results and enables calculation of unemployment by different group categories such as race and gender
this method is the most internationally comparable
official estimates are determined by a combination of information from one or more of the other three methods
the use of this method has been declining in favor of labour surveys
social insurance statistics such as unemployment benefits are computed base on the number of persons insured representing the total labour force and the number of persons who are insured that are collecting benefits
this method has been heavily criticized because if the expiration of benefits before the person finds work
employment office statistics are the least effective since they include only a monthly tally of unemployed persons who enter employment offices
this method also includes those who are not unemployed by the ilo definition the primary measure of unemployment u allows for comparisons between countries
unemployment differs from country to country and across different time periods
for example in the s and s the united states had lower unemployment levels than many countries in the european union which had significant internal variation with countries like the united kingdom and denmark outperforming italy and france
however large economic events like the great depression can lead to similar unemployment rates across the globe
in the ilo adopted a resolution to introduce new indicators to measure the unemployment rate
lu unemployment rate persons in unemployment labour force
lu combined rate of time related underemployment and unemployment persons in time related underemployment persons in unemployment labour force x
lu combined rate of unemployment and potential labour force persons in unemployment potential labour force extended labour force
lu composite measure of labour underutilization persons in time related underemployment persons in unemployment potentiallabour force extended labour force
eurostat the statistical office of the european union defines unemployed as those persons between age and who are not working have looked for work in the last four weeks and are ready to start work within two weeks this definition conforms to ilo standards
both the actual count and the unemployment rate are reported
statistical data are available by member state for the european union as a whole eu as well as for the eurozone ea
eurostat also includes a long term unemployment rate which is defined as part of the unemployed who have been unemployed for more than one year
the main source used is the european union labour force survey eu lfs
it collects data on all member states each quarter
for monthly calculations national surveys or national registers from employment offices are used in conjunction with quarterly eu lfs data
the exact calculation for individual countries resulting in harmonized monthly data depends on the availability of the data
the bureau of labor statistics measures employment and unemployment of those over years of age by using two different labor force surveys conducted by the united states census bureau within the united states department of commerce and or the bureau of labor statistics within the united states department of labor that gather employment statistics monthly
the current population survey cps or household survey conducts a survey based on a sample of households
the survey measures the unemployment rate based on the ilo definition
the current employment statistics survey ces or payroll survey conducts a survey based on a sample of businesses and government agencies which represent individual employers
since the survey measures only civilian nonagricultural employment it does not calculate an unemployment rate and it differs from the ilo unemployment rate definition
both sources have different classification criteria and usually produce differing results
additional data are also available from the government such as the unemployment insurance weekly claims report available from the office of workforce security within the u s
department of labor s employment and training administration
the bureau of labor statistics provides up to date numbers via a pdf linked here
the bls also provides a readable concise current employment situation summary updated monthly
the bureau of labor statistics also calculates six alternate measures of unemployment u to u which measure different aspects of unemployment
u percentage of labor force unemployed weeks or longer
u percentage of labor force who lost jobs or completed temporary work
u official unemployment rate per the ilo definition occurs when people are without jobs and they have actively looked for work within the past four weeks
u u discouraged workers or those who have stopped looking for work because current economic conditions make them believe that no work is available for them
u u other marginally attached workers or loosely attached workers or those who would like and are able to work but have not looked for work recently
u u part time workers who want to work full time but cannot for economic reasons underemployment note marginally attached workers are added to the total labour force for unemployment rate calculation for u u and u
the bls revised the cps in and among the changes the measure representing the official unemployment rate was renamed u instead of u
in representative hunter proposed that the bureau of labor statistics use the u rate instead of the current u rate
statistics for the us economy as a whole hide variations among groups
for example in january the us unemployment rates were for adult men for adult women for caucasians for hispanics or latinos all races for african americans for asian americans and for teenagers
also the us unemployment rate would be at least higher if prisoners and jail inmates were counted
the unemployment rate is included in a number of major economic indices including the us conference board s index of leading indicators a macroeconomic measure of the state of the economy
some critics believe that current methods of measuring unemployment are inaccurate in terms of the impact of unemployment on people as these methods do not take into account the of the available working population incarcerated in us prisons who may or may not be working while they are incarcerated those who have lost their jobs and have become discouraged over time from actively looking for work those who are self employed or wish to become self employed such as tradesmen or building contractors or information technology consultants those who have retired before the official retirement age but would still like to work involuntary early retirees those on disability pensions who do not possess full health but still wish to work in occupations that suitable for their medical conditions or those who work for payment for as little as one hour per week but would like to work full time
the last people are involuntary part time workers those who are underemployed such as a computer programmer who is working in a retail store until he can find a permanent job involuntary stay at home mothers who would prefer to work and graduate and professional school students who are unable to find worthwhile jobs after they graduated with their bachelor s degrees
internationally some nations unemployment rates are sometimes muted or appear less severe because of the number of self employed individuals working in agriculture
small independent farmers are often considered self employed and so cannot be unemployed
that can impact non industrialized economies such as the united states and europe in the early th century since overall unemployment was approximately because so many individuals were self employed independent farmers however non agricultural unemployment was as high as
many economies industrialize and so experience increasing numbers of non agricultural workers
for example the united states non agricultural labour force increased from in to in and in
the shift away from self employment increases the percentage of the population that is included in unemployment rates
when unemployment rates between countries or time periods are compared it is best to consider differences in their levels of industrialization and self employment
additionally the measures of employment and unemployment may be too high in some countries the availability of unemployment benefits can inflate statistics by giving an incentive to register as unemployed
people who do not seek work may choose to declare themselves unemployed to get benefits people with undeclared paid occupations may try to get unemployment benefits in addition to the money that they earn from their work
however in the united states canada mexico australia japan and the european union unemployment is measured using a sample survey akin to a gallup poll
according to the bls a number of eastern european nations have instituted labour force surveys as well
the sample survey has its own problems because the total number of workers in the economy is calculated based on a sample rather than a census
it is possible to be neither employed nor unemployed by ilo definitions by being outside of the labour force such people have no job and are not looking for one
many of them go to school or are retired
family responsibilities keep others out of the labour force
still others have a physical or mental disability that prevents them from participating in the labour force
some people simply elect not to work and prefer to be dependent on others for sustenance
typically employment and the labour force include only work that is done for monetary gain
hence a homemaker is neither part of the labour force nor unemployed
also full time students and prisoners are considered to be neither part of the labour force nor unemployed
the number of prisoners can be important
in economists lawrence f
katz and alan b
krueger estimated that increased incarceration lowered measured unemployment in the united states by between and the late s
in particular as of roughly of the us population is incarcerated of the available working population
additionally children the elderly and some individuals with disabilities are typically not counted as part of the labour force and so are not included in the unemployment statistics
however some elderly and many disabled individuals are active in the labour market
in the early stages of an economic boom unemployment often rises
that is because people join the labour market give up studying start a job hunt etc as a result of the improving job market but until they have actually found a position they are counted as unemployed
similarly during a recession the increase in the unemployment rate is moderated by people leaving the labour force or being otherwise discounted from the labour force such as with the self employed
for the fourth quarter of according to oecd employment outlook isbn normalized unemployment for men aged to was in the us and in france
at the same time and for the same population the employment rate number of workers divided by population was in the us and in france
that example shows that the unemployment rate was higher in france than in the us but more people in that demographic were working in france than in the us which is counterintuitive if it is expected that the unemployment rate reflects the health of the labour market
those deficiencies make many labour market economists prefer to look at a range of economic statistics such as labour market participation rate the percentage of people between and who are currently employed or searching for employment the total number of full time jobs in an economy the number of people seeking work as a raw number and not a percentage and the total number of person hours worked in a month compared to the total number of person hours people would like to work
in particular the national bureau of economic research does not use the unemployment rate but prefers various employment rates to date recessions
the labor force participation rate is the ratio between the labor force and the overall size of their cohort national population of the same age range
in the west during the later half of the th century the labor force participation rate increased significantly because of an increase in the number of women entering the workplace
in the united states there have been four significant stages of women s participation in the labour force increases in the th century and decreases in the st century
male labor force participation decreased from to
since october men have been increasingly joining the labour force
from the late th century to the s very few women worked outside the home
they were young single women who typically withdrew from the labor force at marriage unless family needed two incomes
such women worked primarily in the textile manufacturing industry or as domestic workers
that profession empowered women and allowed them to earn a living wage
at times they were a financial help to their families
between and female labor force participation increased primarily because of the increased demand for office workers women s participation in the high school movement and electrification which reduced the time that was spent on household chores
from the s to the early s most women were secondary earners working mainly as secretaries teachers nurses and librarians pink collar jobs
from the mid s to the late s there was a period of revolution of women in the labor force brought on by various factors many of which arose from the second wave feminism movement
women more accurately planned for their future in the work force by investing in more applicable majors in college that prepared them to enter and compete in the labor market
in the united states the female labor force participation rate rose from approximately in to a peak of in
as of april the female labor force participation is at the male labor force participation rate is at and the total is
a common theory in modern economics claims that the rise of women participating in the us labor force in the s to the s was caused by the introduction of a new contraceptive technology birth control pills as well as the adjustment of age of majority laws
the use of birth control gave women the flexibility of opting to invest and to advance their career while they maintained a relationship
by having control over the timing of their fertility they were not running a risk of thwarting their career choices
however only of the population actually used the birth control pill
that implies that other factors may have contributed to women choosing to invest in advancing their careers
one factor may be that an increasing number of men delayed the age of marriage which allowed women to marry later in life without them worrying about the quality of older men
other factors include the changing nature of work with machines replacing physical labor thus eliminating many traditional male occupations and the rise of the service sector in which many jobs are gender neutral
another factor that may have contributed to the trend was the equal pay act of which aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex
such legislation diminished sexual discrimination and encouraged more women to enter the labor market by receiving fair remuneration to help raising families and children
at the turn of the st century the labor force participation began to reverse its long period of increase
reasons for the change include a rising share of older workers an increase in school enrollment rates among young workers and a decrease in female labor force participation
the labor force participation rate can decrease when the rate of growth of the population outweighs that of the employed and the unemployed together
the labor force participation rate is a key component in long term economic growth almost as important as productivity
a historic shift began around the end of the great recession as women began leaving the labor force in the united states and other developed countries
the female labor force participation rate in the united states has steadily decreased since and as of april the female labor force participation rate has gone back down to levels of
participation rates are defined as follows
the labor force participation rate explains how an increase in the unemployment rate can occur simultaneously with an increase in employment
if a large number of new workers enter the labor force but only a small fraction become employed then the increase in the number of unemployed workers can outpace the growth in employment
the unemployment to population ratio calculates the share of unemployed for the whole population
this is in contrast to the unemployment rate which calculates the percentage of unemployed persons in relation to the active population
particularly many young people between and are studying full time and so are neither working nor looking for a job
that means that they are not part of the labor force which is used as the denominator when the unemployment rate is calculated
the youth unemployment ratios in the european union range from austria to percent spain
they are considerably lower than the standard youth unemployment rates ranging from germany to percent greece
high and the persistent unemployment in which economic inequality increases has a negative effect on subsequent long run economic growth
unemployment can harm growth because it is a waste of resources generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions drives people to poverty constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility and erodes self esteem promoting social dislocation unrest and conflict
the winner of the nobel prize in economics robert j
shiller said that rising inequality in the united states and elsewhere is the most important problem
unemployed individuals are unable to earn money to meet financial obligations
failure to pay mortgage payments or to pay rent may lead to homelessness through foreclosure or eviction
across the united states the growing ranks of people made homeless in the foreclosure crisis are generating tent cities
unemployment increases susceptibility to cardiovascular disease somatization anxiety disorders depression and suicide
in addition unemployed people have higher rates of medication use poor diet physician visits tobacco smoking alcoholic beverage consumption drug use and lower rates of exercise
according to a study published in social indicator research even those who tend to be optimistic find it difficult to look on the bright side of things when unemployed
using interviews and data from german participants aged to including individuals coping with the stresses of real life and not just a volunteering student population the researchers determined that even optimists struggled with being unemployed
harvey brenner found that for every increase in the number of unemployed there is an increase of in total mortality a increase in cardiovascular disease more cirrhosis cases more suicides more arrests and more assaults reported to the police
a study by christopher ruhm in on the effect of recessions on health found that several measures of health actually improve during recessions
as for the impact of an economic downturn on crime during the great depression the crime rate did not decrease
the unemployed in the us often use welfare programs such as food stamps or accumulating debt because unemployment insurance in the us generally does not replace most of the income that was received on the job and one cannot receive such aid indefinitely
not everyone suffers equally from unemployment
in a prospective study of individuals over four years highly conscientious people suffered more than twice as much if they became unemployed
the authors suggested that may because of conscientious people making different attributions about why they became unemployed or through experiencing stronger reactions following failure
there is also the possibility of reverse causality from poor health to unemployment
some researchers hold that many of the low income jobs are not really a better option than unemployment with a welfare state with its unemployment insurance benefits
however since it is difficult or impossible to get unemployment insurance benefits without having worked in the past those jobs and unemployment are more complementary than they are substitutes
they are often held short term either by students or by those trying to gain experience turnover in most low paying jobs is high
another cost for the unemployed is that the combination of unemployment lack of financial resources and social responsibilities may push unemployed workers to take jobs that do not fit their skills or allow them to use their talents
unemployment can cause underemployment and fear of job loss can spur psychological anxiety
as well as anxiety it can cause depression lack of confidence and huge amounts of stress which is increased when the unemployed are faced with health issues poverty and lack of relational support
another personal cost of unemployment is its impact on relationships
a study from covizzi which examined the relationship between unemployment and divorce found that the rate of divorce is greater for couples when one partner is unemployed
however a more recent study has found that some couples often stick together in unhappy or unhealthy marriages when they are unemployed to buffer financial costs
a study by van der meer found that the stigma that comes from being unemployed affects personal well being especially for men who often feel as though their masculine identities are threatened by unemployment
unemployment can also bring personal costs in relation to gender
one study found that women are more likely to experience unemployment than men and that they are less likely to move from temporary positions to permanent positions
another study on gender and unemployment found that men however are more likely to experience greater stress depression and adverse effects from unemployment largely stemming from the perceived threat to their role as breadwinner
the study found that men expect themselves to be viewed as less manly after a job loss than they actually are and so they engage in compensating behaviors such as financial risk taking and increased assertiveness
unemployment has been linked to extremely adverse effects on men s mental health
professor ian hickie of the university of sydney said that evidence showed that men have more restricted social networks than women and that men have are heavily work based
therefore the loss of a job for men means the loss of a whole set of social connections as well
that loss can then lead to men becoming socially isolated very quickly
an australian study on the mental health impacts of graduating during an economic downturn found that the negative mental health outcomes are greater and more scarring for men than women
the effect was particularly pronounced for those with vocational or secondary education
costs of unemployment also vary depending on age
the young and the old are the two largest age groups currently experiencing unemployment
a study from jacob and kleinert found that young people ages to who have fewer resources and limited work experiences are more likely to be unemployed
other researchers have found that today s high school seniors place a lower value on work than those in the past which is likely because they recognize the limited availability of jobs
at the other end of the age spectrum studies have found that older individuals have more barriers than younger workers to employment require stronger social networks to acquire work and are also less likely to move from temporary to permanent positions
additionally some older people see age discrimination as the reason for them not getting hired
an economy with high unemployment is not using all of the resources specifically labour available to it
since it is operating below its production possibility frontier it could have higher output if all of the workforce were usefully employed
however there is a tradeoff between economic efficiency and unemployment if all frictionally unemployed accepted the first job that they were offered they would be likely to be operating at below their skill level reducing the economy s efficiency
during a long period of unemployment workers can lose their skills causing a loss of human capital
being unemployed can also reduce the life expectancy of workers by about seven years
high unemployment can encourage xenophobia and protectionism since workers fear that foreigners are stealing their jobs
efforts to preserve existing jobs of domestic and native workers include legal barriers against outsiders who want jobs obstacles to immigration and or tariffs and similar trade barriers against foreign competitors
high unemployment can also cause social problems such as crime
if people have less disposable income than before it is very likely that crime levels within the economy will increase
a study published in the lancet estimates that unemployment causes suicides a year globally
high levels of unemployment can be causes of civil unrest in some cases leading to revolution particularly totalitarianism
the fall of the weimar republic in and adolf hitler s rise to power which culminated in world war ii and the deaths of tens of millions and the destruction of much of the physical capital of europe is attributed to the poor economic conditions in germany at the time notably a high unemployment rate of above see great depression in central europe for details
however the hyperinflation in the weimar republic is not directly blamed for the nazi rise
hyperinflation occurred primarily in to the year of hitler s beer hall putsch
although hyperinflation has been blamed for damaging the credibility of democratic institutions the nazis did not assume government until ten years after the hyperinflation but in the midst of high unemployment
rising unemployment has traditionally been regarded by the public and the media in any country as a key guarantor of electoral defeat for any government that oversees it
that was very much the consensus in the united kingdom until when thatcher s conservative government won a landslide in the general election despite overseeing a rise in unemployment from million to million since the election
the primary benefit of unemployment is that people are available for hire without being headhunted away from their existing employers
that permits both new and old businesses to take on staff
unemployment is argued to be beneficial to the people who are not unemployed in the sense that it averts inflation which itself has damaging effects by providing in marxian terms a reserve army of labour which keeps wages in check
however the direct connection between full local employment and local inflation has been disputed by some because of the recent increase in international trade that supplies low priced goods even while local employment rates rise to full employment
full employment cannot be achieved because workers would shirk if they were not threatened with the possibility of unemployment
the curve for the no shirking condition labelled nsc thus goes to infinity at full employment
the inflation fighting benefits to the entire economy arising from a presumed optimum level of unemployment have been studied extensively
the shapiro stiglitz model suggests that wages never bid down sufficiently to reach unemployment
that occurs because employers know that when wages decrease workers will shirk and expend less effort
employers avoid shirking by preventing wages from decreasing so low that workers give up and become unproductive
the higher wages perpetuate unemployment but the threat of unemployment reduces shirking
before current levels of world trade were developed unemployment was shown to reduce inflation following the phillips curve or to decelerate inflation following the nairu natural rate of unemployment theory since it is relatively easy to seek a new job without losing a current job
when more jobs are available for fewer workers lower unemployment that may allow workers to find the jobs that better fit their tastes talents and needs
as in the marxian theory of unemployment special interests may also benefit
some employers may expect that employees with no fear of losing their jobs will not work as hard or will demand increased wages and benefit
according to that theory unemployment may promote general labour productivity and profitability by increasing employers rationale for their monopsony like power and profits
optimal unemployment has also been defended as an environmental tool to brake the constantly accelerated growth of the gdp to maintain levels that are sustainable in the context of resource constraints and environmental impacts
however the tool of denying jobs to willing workers seems a blunt instrument for conserving resources and the environment
it reduces the consumption of the unemployed across the board and only in the short term
full employment of the unemployed workforce all focused toward the goal of developing more environmentally efficient methods for production and consumption might provide a more significant and lasting cumulative environmental benefit and reduced resource consumption
some critics of the culture of work such as the anarchist bob black see employment as culturally overemphasized in modern countries
such critics often propose quitting jobs when possible working less reassessing the cost of living to that end creation of jobs that are fun as opposed to work and creating cultural norms in which work is seen as unhealthy
these people advocate an anti work ethic for life
as a result of productivity the work week declined considerably during the th century
by the s the average workweek in the us was hours but it was reduced to hours after which overtime premium was applied as part of the national industrial recovery act
during the great depression the enormous productivity gains caused by electrification mass production and agricultural mechanization were believed to have ended the need for a large number of previously employed workers
societies try a number of different measures to get as many people as possible into work and various societies have experienced close to full employment for extended periods particularly during the post world war ii economic expansion
the united kingdom in the s and s averaged unemployment and in australia the white paper on full employment in australia established a government policy of full employment which lasted until the s
however mainstream economic discussions of full employment since the s suggest that attempts to reduce the level of unemployment below the natural rate of unemployment will fail but result only in less output and more inflation
increases in the demand for labour move the economy along the demand curve increasing wages and employment
the demand for labour in an economy is derived from the demand for goods and services
as such if the demand for goods and services in the economy increases the demand for labour will increase increasing employment and wages
there are many ways to stimulate demand for goods and services
increasing wages to the working class those more likely to spend the increased funds on goods and services rather than various types of savings or commodity purchases is one theory that is proposed
increased wages are believed to be more effective in boosting demand for goods and services than central banking strategies which put the increased money supply mostly into the hands of wealthy persons and institutions
monetarists suggest that increasing money supply in general increases short term demand
as for the long term demand the increased demand is negated by inflation
a rise in fiscal expenditures is another strategy for boosting aggregate demand
providing aid to the unemployed is a strategy that is used to prevent cutbacks in consumption of goods and services which can lead to a vicious cycle of further job losses and further decreases in consumption and demand
many countries aid the unemployed through social welfare programs
such unemployment benefits include unemployment insurance unemployment compensation welfare and subsidies to aid in retraining
the main goal of such programs is to alleviate short term hardships and more importantly to allow workers more time to search for a job
a direct demand side solution to unemployment is government funded employment of the able bodied poor
this was notably implemented in britain from the th century until in the institution of the workhouse which provided jobs for the unemployed with harsh conditions and poor wages to dissuade their use
a modern alternative is a job guarantee in which the government guarantees work at a living wage
temporary measures can include public works programs such as the works progress administration
government funded employment is not widely advocated as a solution to unemployment except in times of crisis
that is attributed to the public sector jobs existence depending directly on the tax receipts from private sector employment
in the us the unemployment insurance allowance is based solely on previous income not time worked family size etc and usually compensates for one third of previous income
to qualify people must reside in their respective state for at least a year and work
the system was established by the social security act of
although of citizens are covered by unemployment insurance less than apply for and receive benefits
however the number applying for and receiving benefits increases during recessions
for highly seasonal industries the system provides income to workers during the off season thus encouraging them to stay attached to the industry
according to classical economic theory markets reach equilibrium where supply equals demand everyone who wants to sell at the market price can do so
those who do not want to sell at that price do not in the labour market this is classical unemployment
monetary policy and fiscal policy can both be used to increase short term growth in the economy increasing the demand for labour and decreasing unemployment
however the labor market is not efficient although it may be more efficient than the bureaucracy
some argue that minimum wages and union activity keep wages from falling which means that too many people want to sell their labour at the going price but cannot
that assumes perfect competition exists in the labour market specifically that no single entity is large enough to affect wage levels and that employees are similar in ability
advocates of supply side policies believe those policies can solve the problem by making the labour market more flexible
these include removing the minimum wage and reducing the power of unions
supply siders argue that their reforms increase long term growth by reducing labour costs
the increased supply of goods and services requires more workers increasing employment
it is argued that supply side policies which include cutting taxes on businesses and reducing regulation create jobs reduce unemployment and decrease labor s share of national income
other supply side policies include education to make workers more attractive to employers
there are relatively limited historical records on unemployment because it has not always been acknowledged or measured systematically
industrialization involves economies of scale which often prevent individuals from having the capital to create their own jobs to be self employed
an individual who cannot join an enterprise or create a job is unemployed
as individual farmers ranchers spinners doctors and merchants are organized into large enterprises those who cannot join or compete become unemployed
recognition of unemployment occurred slowly as economies across the world industrialized and bureaucratized
before that traditional self sufficient native societies had no concept of unemployment
the recognition of the concept of unemployment is best exemplified through the well documented historical records in england
for example in th century england no distinction was made between vagrants and the jobless both were simply categorized as sturdy beggars who were to be punished and moved on
the closing of the monasteries in the s increased poverty as the roman catholic church had helped the poor
in addition there was a significant rise in enclosures during the tudor period
also the population was rising
those unable to find work had a stark choice starve or break the law
in a bill was drawn up calling for the creation of a system of public works to deal with the problem of unemployment which were to be funded by a tax on income and capital
a law that was passed a year later allowed vagabonds to be whipped and hanged
in a bill was passed that subjected vagrants to some of the more extreme provisions of the criminal law two years servitude and branding with a v as the penalty for the first offense and death for the second
during the reign of henry viii as many as people are estimated to have been executed
in the act each town was required to provide work for the unemployed
the elizabethan poor law of one of the world s first government sponsored welfare programs made a clear distinction between those who were unable to work and those able bodied people who refused employment
under the poor law systems of england and wales scotland and ireland a workhouse was a place people unable to support themselves could go to live and work
by some parish and corporation workhouses had been established in england and wales and housed almost paupers
a description of the miserable living standards of the mill workers in england in was given by fredrick engels in the condition of the working class in england in
in the preface to the edition engels noted that the extreme poverty he had written about in had largely disappeared
david ames wells also noted that living conditions in england had improved near the end of the th century and that unemployment was low
the scarcity and the high price of labor in the us in the th century was well documented by contemporary accounts as in the following
the laboring classes are comparatively few in number but this is counterbalanced by and indeed may be one of the causes of the eagerness by which they call in the use of machinery in almost every department of industry
wherever it can be applied as a substitute for manual labor it is universally and willingly resorted to
it is this condition of the labor market and this eager resort to machinery wherever it can be applied to which under the guidance of superior education and intelligence the remarkable prosperity of the united states is due joseph whitworth scarcity of labor was a factor in the economics of slavery in the united states
as new territories were opened and federal land sales were conducted land had to be cleared and new homesteads established
hundreds of thousands of immigrants annually came to the us and found jobs digging canals and building railroads
almost all work during most of the th century was done by hand or with horses mules or oxen since there was very little mechanization
the workweek during most of the th century was hours
unemployment at times was between one and two percent
the tight labor market was a factor in productivity gains by allowing workers to maintain or to increase their nominal wages during the secular deflation that caused real wages to rise at various times in the th century especially in its final decades
there were labor shortages during world war i
ford motor co
doubled wages to reduce turnover
after unemployment gradually began to rise

it hired men and some women off the relief roles dole typically for unskilled labor
during the new deal over three million unemployed young men were taken out of their homes and placed for six months into more than work camps managed by the civilian conservation corps
unemployment in the united kingdom fell later in the s as the depression eased and it remained low in single figures after world war ii
fredrick mills found that in the us of the decline in work hours was due to the fall in production and was from increased productivity
by unemployment in the united kingdom had crept back up above and it was even higher by the end of the decade with inflation also being high
although the monetarist economic policies of margaret thatcher s conservative government saw inflation reduced after unemployment soared in the early s and in it exceeded a level that had not been seen for some years
that represented one in eight of the workforce with unemployment exceeding in some places that had relied on declining industries such as coal mining
however it was a time of high unemployment in all other major industrialised nations as well
by the spring of unemployment had risen by in the previous months compared to in japan in the us and in west germany seven years before reunification
unemployment in the united kingdom remained above until the spring of when the economy enjoyed a boom
by the end of unemployment had fallen to
however inflation had reached and the following year it reached a nine year high of leading to increased interest rates
another recession occurred from to

unemployment has risen in two thirds of european countries since
into the st century unemployment in the united kingdom remained low and the economy remaining strong and several other european economies such as france and germany experienced a minor recession and a substantial rise in unemployment
in when the recession brought on another increase in the united kingdom after years of economic growth and no major rises in unemployment
in early unemployment passed the million mark and economists were predicting it would soon reach million
however the end of the recession was declared in january and unemployment peaked at nearly million in appearing to ease fears of unemployment reaching million
the unemployment rate of britain s young black people was in
has seen the employment rate increase from to as supported by showing the uk is creating more job opportunities and forecasts the rate of increase in will be another
the global recession has been called a mancession because of the disproportionate number of men who lost their jobs as compared to women
the gender gap became wide in the united states in when of men in the labor force were unemployed compared with of women
three quarters of the jobs that were lost in the recession in the us were held by men
a april asia times article noted in regional giant south africa some textile workers have lost their jobs in the past two years due to the influx of chinese goods
