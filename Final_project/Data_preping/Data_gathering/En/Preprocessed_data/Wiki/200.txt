This list also excludes all actors with television or live theatre stars on the Walk of Fame, as well as all animal actors and fictional characters.
The star locations and the years of the induction ceremonies are available on the official Hollywood Walk of Fame website maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce
The years of birth and death are available in the biographical articles on the Los Angeles Times Hollywood Star Walk website, with more accurate birth years from government records—such as birth certificates, census and military records—for some actors via their Wikipedia article sources.

As of 2020, more than 2,600 stars are on the Hollywood Walk of Fame among all five categories: motion pictures, television, recording, radio and live performance
Stars for motion picture actors comprise about one third of all Walk of Fame stars.
four actors—Alice Calhoun, Patty McCormack, Henry O'Neill and Helen Twelvetrees—have no induction year specified on the official site, while Joyce Compton is missing a profile page on the official website, though she appears on the Los Angeles Times website; in all those cases, the year is presumed to be 1960 which was the year of the initial placement of 1,558 stars.
only acting awards are considered in this list; Academy Award information is available on the official Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences database website via dynamically-generated lists.
