After Diokno enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of WWII When the war was over he was granted a special dispensation by the Supreme Court of the Philippines and was allowed to take the Philippine Bar Examination despite having never completed his degree He topped the bar exam together with a year old future ally named Jovito Salonga with a score of the highest since Jose L Quintos of Bulacan set the record in As a reward he took a solo vacation in the United States where he would frequently call Carmen Nena Icasiano a commerce student from Bulacan studying at Far Eastern University They met in at a dinner party hosted by a future mayor named Arsenio Lacson and Diokno started courting her refusing to listen to his father to marry José Abad Santos's daughter Diokno married Carmen at Ermita Church immediately after Diokno returned from his shortened trip He quickly proposed to her after he found out on the telephone that she had tuberculosis and had missed seeing him
Immediately after topping the Bar exam Diokno embarked on his law practice at his father's bupete or law office handling and winning high profile cases including Vera v Avelino GR L on behalf of his father Sen Ramón Diokno who let the young Diokno quickly take over the bupete Diokno also successfully fought libel charges against radio personality and Manila Mayor Arsenio Lacson who was a close friend and would often visit Diokno and his wife in the wee hours at their home in Parañaque to prepare them breakfast Diokno would in turn edit Mayor Lacson's newspaper columns for Free Philippines Historians learned a few years after Mayor Lacson's sudden passing that Lacson even intended for Diokno to be his running mate as the Manila Mayor's fame made him the top presidential candidate for the election By Diokno gained enough stature to be selected to join a special committee to investigate the Department of Finance He was later invited to return to investigate anomalies happening in the Bureau of Supply Corrections
With his reputation as a legal practitioner established and secured in Diokno was appointed Secretary of Justice by President Diosdado Macapagal through Lacson's support
In March Diokno ordered a raid on a firm owned by Harry S Stonehill an American businessman who was suspected of tax evasion and bribing public officials among other crimes Diokno's investigation of Stonehill further revealed corruption within government ranks and as Secretary of Justice he prepared to prosecute those involved However President Macapagal intervened negotiating a deal that absolved Stonehill in exchange for his deportation then ordering Diokno to resign Diokno only learned of his resignation from the news and received death threats from supporters of the president which prompted Mayor Lacson to offer Diokno special security Diokno questioned Macapagal's actions saying How can the government now prosecute the corrupted when it has allowed the corrupter to go Macapagal would become unpopular and eventually lose the next election in to another controversial politician also connected with Stonehill named Ferdinand Marcos
In Diokno ran for senator under the Nacionalista Party and won with almost half of the popular vote
His laws and bills were often considered nationalistic in essence as he called for the creation of the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act which would ban discrimination of Filipinos in American companies The infamous ex president of San Miguel Corp named Andy Soriano who manipulated the Philippine Association and US Ambassador Bill Blair controversially fought to have the bill eventually vetoed before they stepped down from their positions Diokno often fought American policies that involved transfer pricing
For his performance as legislator and fight for nationalism Diokno was named Outstanding Senator by the Philippines Free Press from to making him the only legislator to receive the recognition for four successive years Diokno also served as the delegate for many commissions including the United Nations General Assembly in the middle of the s
Senator Diokno became chairman of the Senate Economic Affairs Committee and worked for the passage of pro Filipino legislation including what is considered to be the most important incentive law in the country RA also known as the Investment Incentives Act of which provides incentives to mostly Filipino investors and entrepreneurs that would place control of the Philippine economy predominantly in the hands of Filipinos The law would also be the first groundbreaking initiative of the Philippine economy to gradually step out of its import substitution mindset It also led to the foundation of the Board of Investments the premier government agency responsible for propagating investments in the Philippines
Diokno then authored RA or the Oil Industry Commission Act of which created the Oil Industry Commission OIC to regulate oil pricing in different companies This eventually led to the dominance of three oil companies in Caltex the alternative name of the American corporation Chevron Petron a local partner of Middle Eastern Saudi Aramco and is owned by the monopoly brewery San Miguel Corporation and Shell based in the Netherlands He also authored Joint Resolution No which set the policies for economic development and social progress In addition to that he sponsored and co authored the Export Incentives Act of and the Revised Election Law among many others
When Marcos suspended the fundamental legal right of the writ of habeas corpus following the president's bombing of the Plaza Miranda gathering of Liberal Party members Diokno resigned from the Nacionalista Party in protest and took to the streets Sen Diokno called on students to start protesting against the administration anticipating that Marcos who was nearing the end of his last term would declare martial law and change the constitution to give himself absolute power
Previously Marcos began building notoriety following the Jabidah massacre where an estimated to as much as alleged Muslim youths were gunned down in Corregidor by unknown armed men in Following this event a Moro insurgency would quickly develop starting in Mindanao it would evolve into a widespread armed conflict that would engulf the nation decades after Marcos's lifetime Marcos tried to suppress the media and block coverage of the event but it was too late Diokno and many other senators sensed Marcos might have developed a hidden agenda From then on Diokno began to put greater emphasis on human rights in public speeches and events In an oft quoted speech he would declare No cause is more worthy than the cause of human rights Human rights are more than legal concepts they are the essence of man They are what make man human That is why they are called human rights deny them and you deny man's humanity
He was the leader of the Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties MCCCL which organized a series of rallies from to The most massive of these rallies involved protestors and was held on September shortly before the imposition of martial law by the Marcos dictatorship During this rally protestors denounced the infamous Oplan Sagittarius the devious operation plan by Marcos to declare martial law Sen Benigno Ninoy Aquino exposed the Oplan Sagittarius scandal earlier in a September speech and spoke to the Senate on September the same day that the MCCCL held their exceptionally large rally at Plaza Miranda Marcos reacted with fear of deposition and immediately finalized Proclamation No which declared nationwide martial law at pm later that evening Exactly the next day on September at pm Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile was told to exit his car near Wack Wack village Another vehicle carrying gunmen arrived and stopped near an electrical post right beside Enrile's vehicle They then alighted from their vehicle and began to fire at the large sedan of Enrile to give an impression of a terrorist ambush setting the stage for Marcos's theatrical television announcement
On September Diokno's second term as senator was officially cut short when Marcos announced martial law on television at pm
At am before the announcement Diokno was arrested by the dictatorship After cutting communication lines in multiple neighborhoods including Diokno's home six carloads carrying forty armed soldiers visited Diokno at his home to invite him for questioning He changed from his pajamas and was sent to Camp Crame They had no warrant After Diokno was brought to Camp Crame he was transferred to Fort Bonifacio where he was detained along with other opposition members such as Aquino and Chino Roces the founder and head of The Manila Times the leading newspaper at the time The military's Defense Minister Enrile offered a security detail to Diokno to protect him from Communist assassins to which Diokno laughed and responded that he really needed protection from the military
Diokno and Aquino whom the dictatorship considered their foremost opponents were later handcuffed blindfolded and transferred via a chopper to solitary confinement at Fort Magsaysay located in the municipality of Laur Nueva Ecija They remained confined to Fort Magsaysay for exactly thirty days They both learned of each other's presence through singing One of them would frequently sing the national anthem Lupang Hinirang or Chosen Land to which the other would reply by singing Bayan Ko or My Country to prove he was still alive To tally the number of days Diokno used knots of ropes from his mosquito net as well as the back of a soap packaging box and crossed out each day in the manner of a calendar His visiting family members were often strip searched by soldiers They would sneak in books in French and Spanish for him to read and he would converse to his wife in Spanish for only them to comprehend Diokno would tell his family not to weep in front of the sadistic soldiers Only his Aunt Paz Wilson a woman in her s and a mother figure since his mother's passing would frequently cry during every visit She continued to visit despite also undergoing strip searches The family would be in tears once they left the prison where the Aquino family would see them This helped the Aquinos prepare themselves emotionally since they never saw the Diokno family manifest much pain before Nena Diokno suspicious of Marcos took most of her husband's books at the library along MH del Pilar and brought them home before the military burned down the library Jose would thank her as he was very familiar with the library and memorized the location of each shelf and book he read Outside the prison Marcos announced at his executive mansion Malacañang Palace that September would be known as National Thanksgiving Day the same day Diokno led his biggest Plaza Miranda rally This declaration has led to a general confusion about the true date of the public announcement of martial law which was actually on September two days after Proclamation No was signed
Diokno spent days or nearly two years in detention mainly at the maximum security compound of Fort Bonifacio While Aquino was charged with subversion no charge was ever filed against Diokno Diokno was released arbitrarily on September —Marcos's th birthday After his release Sen Diokno mentioned in an interview with videographer Andrew Pearson that he served as an instructor teaching law courses at the University of the Philippines UP at their request after he was released from Fort Bonifacio This continued until Marcos found out and had him banned though Diokno continued returning for speeches and conferences and was later honored with a mural of him and other martial law heroes at the school's main college of Palma Hall
A year later in Diokno was chosen as chairman of the Civil Liberties Union a position he held until Later in March Diokno founded the Kilusan sa Kapangyarihan at Karapatan ng Bayan Movement for People's Sovereignty and Democracy Organization or KAAKBAY which was ideologically independent of beliefs like Marxism but was joined by fellow Marxists and Capitalists KAAKBAY influenced the public and fought hard against the Marcos administration using non violent activism or pressure politics KAAKBAY later elevated pressure politics as an important principle for post democracy through its publication called The Plaridel Papers The August edition of The Plaridel Papers popularized the concept of pressure politics and introduced a political system that would involve the parliament of the streets in building a popular democracy KAAKBAY was also one of the main member organizations of the Justice for Aquino Justice for All JAJA coalition which was founded by Diokno on August following Ninoy Aquino's assassination for returning to the country to face Marcos JAJA was the first united front against Marcos but it did not last long KAAKBAY served as the main coalition that kept the other extreme groups from leaving JAJA Unfortunately JAJA was later replaced by the predominantly leftist Coalition of Organizations for the Restoration of Democracy CORD in mid which had almost the same members Before the creation of CORD many former JAJA members who disagreed with the communists also organized a much wider alliance called the Kongreso ng Mamamayang Pilipino KOMPIL or the Congress of the Filipino People and was mainly headed by Diokno
From January to January delegates representing all sectors gathered at the KOMPIL congress to vote on multiple issues One of the decisions voted by of the attendees was to establish a new Commission on Elections COMELEC Elected leaders included statesmen such as Diokno Lorenzo Tañada Aquilino Pimentel Cecilia Muñoz Palma Ambrosio Padilla Salvador Laurel and Jovito Salonga Others came from non political sectors including Makati's Enrique Zobel who was related to Andy Soriano and due to consanguinity was part of the Ayala Corporation Another leader was Jaime Cardinal Sin who would play an important role two years later for the opposition Of all the issues the largest was concerning a letter they made called the Call for Meaningful Elections CAMEL Some including Diokno and Aquino's brother Butz preferred to boycott any election to avoid legitimizing the Marcos rule On the other hand some of the other signatories preferred to participate in the elections including Ninoy Aquino's widow Corazon Cojuangco Aquino
Diokno was a part of multiple organizations and alliances that fought the administration and foreign intervention He continued to attack the different policies of the Marcos administration such as their controversial nuclear programs that led to the sabotaged construction of the costly Bataan Nuclear Power Plant thereby infuriating Marcos Diokno continued to serve as the leader behind ceasing Marcos's numerous incomplete projects
Immediately after his release Diokno set up the Free Legal Assistance Group or FLAG in which gave free legal services to the victims of martial law It was the first and largest association of human rights attorneys ever assembled in the nation In court Diokno personally defended tribal groups peasants social workers threatened by exploitation and military atrocities which he represented pro bono FLAG popularized developmental legal aid and even doled out allowances to its clients This has led to new laws requiring newly sworn in lawyers to provide free legal assistance for a certain amount of time FLAG handled percent of human rights cases in the country as well as built programs to educate citizens about human rights Diokno was also involved in documenting cases of torture summary execution and disappearances under the Marcos regime
Diokno had no fear of being arrested again and went around and outside the Philippines spreading a message of hope and democracy In another oft quoted speech he once quippedAnd so law in the land died I grieve for it but I do not despair over it I know with a certainty no argument can turn no wind can shake that from its dust will rise a new and better law more just more human and more humane When that will happen I know not That it will happen I knowDiokno also held an important role in Southeast Asia leading a group of senior human rights lawyers from Thailand Indonesia Malaysia and the Philippines in forming the Regional Council on Human Rights in Asia The group was one of the first non governmental organizations NGOs built to promote human rights in Southeast Asia On December in Manila the Regional Council formalized the first human rights declaration of Southeast Asia called the Declaration of the Basic Duties of ASEAN Peoples and Governments Although the council paved the way for future human rights declarations by other organizations like the United Nations their momentum gradually declined decades after the Marcos regime ended Diokno was also inter alia the chairman of the first Human Rights Information and Documentation Systems International HURIDOCS assembly in Strasbourg France which was a historic event that involved over two hundred representatives HURIDOCS founder Hans Thoolen said years later in a tribute to Diokno that he witnessed Diokno present novel ideas on practical ways to defend human rights victims at the SOS Torture constituent assembly held in Geneva Switzerland and that Diokno frequently disseminated human rights primers published in the common vernacular for mass audiences
After founding JAJA together with friend and former Sen Lorenzo M Tañada Diokno was chosen to serve as chairman of its executive committee The two leaders were the only members to call for a boycott in the upcoming nationwide Batasan Elections predicting that it would be fixed
Eventually public outcries after the election results came out with Marcos winning led to the People Power Revolution that peacefully ousted the Marcos family out of the country Diokno was appointed by the new President Corazon Cojuangco Aquino or Cory wife of the slain Ninoy Aquino and mother of the future th president Benigno Noynoy Aquino to serve as founding chairman of the Presidential Committee on Human Rights now the Commission on Human Rights CHR and tasked to lead a government panel to negotiate for the return of rebel forces to the government folds Diokno helped write the Constitution particularly Article XIII defining social justice and human rights Diokno was also the principal negotiator in peace talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines the main leftist coalition founded during martial law

Chel Diokno is a human rights lawyer Chairman of FLAG head of the Diokno Law Center and member of the Jose W Diokno Foundation founding Dean of the Tañada Diokno College of Law and former Special Counsel of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Chel Diokno ran for Senator twice and nearly secured enough votes to obtain a seat He joined the Otso Diretso Direct Eight Candidates to the Senate coalition and Leni Robredo's coalition which opposed the Rodrigo Duterte administration Duterte has been compared to the Marcos family without the privileged background or American ties of Marcos but instead he has been seen currying favor with the Chinese Communist Party Duterte has also committed human rights violations and like Marcos shut down the media corporation of ABS CBN FLAG has represented Rappler founder Maria Ressa during court hearings filed against her by the Duterte administration for Rappler's reports on Duterte's War on Drugs and Murder of Drug Addicts

Diokno is generally seen as the intellectual leader contrasted to the fierceness of Ninoy Aquino in opposing the perversion of the Marcos Administration He managed to have the ability to lead rival political factions together As senator Diokno had a strong relationship with technocrats such as Cesar EA Virata Placido Mapa Jr and Vicente Paterno all of whom joined Marcos's administration during martial law According to these economists and technocrats Diokno did not carry preconceived notions of others provided that nationalist goals could be met His willingness to work with people of contrasting ideologies allowed him to adopt the Investment Incentives Act of Diokno was also popular among all social classes and became a liaison between Pres Aquino's new government and the communists whom he led in different coalitions in the past Despite Diokno's seemingly stoic demeanor and very simple lifestyle Diokno was also known to be quite eloquent and was completely blunt with his opinions as he usually avoided any sugarcoating One instance was when he addressed an affluent American audience at the Westchester Country Club in New York Let us do it as we believe it must be done not as you would do it in our place Let us make our mistakes not suffer yours… With your help or despite your hindrance Philippine nationalism will do the job No one else can The audience fell completely silent after his address

There is one dream that all Filipinos share that our children may have a better life than we have had So there is one vision that is distinctly Filipino the vision to make this country our country a nation for our childrenSeveral parts of the book are now accessible online at The Diokno Foundation
No cause is more worthy than the cause of human rights they are what makes a man human Deny them and you deny man's humanity
There is one dream that we all Filipinos share that our children may have a better life than we have had To make this country our country a nation for our children
Law in the land died I grieve for it but I do not despair over it I know with a certainty no argument can turn no wind can shake that from its dust will rise a new and better law more just more human and more humane When that will happen I know not That it will happen I know
We are one nation with one future a future that will be as bright or as dark as we remain united or divided
Authoritarianism does not let people decide its basic premise is that people do not know how to decide It promotes repression that prevents meaningful change and preserves the structure of power and privilege
Yes men are not compatible with democracy We can strengthen our leaders by pointing out what they are doing that is wrong
The point is not to make a perfect world just a better one and that is difficult enough
Do not forget We Filipinos are the first Asian people who revolted against a western imperial power Spain the first who adopted a democratic republican constitution in Asia the Malolos Constitution the first to fight the first major war of the twentieth century against another western imperial power the United States of America There is no insurmountable barrier that could stop us from becoming what we want to be
All of us are Filipinos not only because we are brothers in blood but because we are all brothers in tears not because we all share the same land but because we share the same dream
Reality is often much more beautiful than anything that we can conceive of If we can release the creative energy of our people then we will have a nation full of hope and full of joy full of life and full of love — a nation that may not be a nation for our children but which will be a nation of our childrenAlfreðsson Guðmundur S On the Eve of Dictatorship and Revolution Martinus Nijhoff Publishers ISBN
