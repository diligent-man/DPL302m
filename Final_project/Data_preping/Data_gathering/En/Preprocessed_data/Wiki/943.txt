lancelot du lac is a french fantasy drama film written and directed by robert bresson
it retells the story of lancelot and guinevere s love as camelot and the round table fall apart
it is based on arthurian legend and medieval romances especially the lancelot grail cycle and the works of chr tien de troyes
in common with bresson s later films the cast was composed of amateur actors several of whom did not appear in any other film
bresson s direction demanded a purposeful lack of emotion in the acting style and reduced or eliminated the fantastical elements of the grail legend
while much of the production is intentionally stylised as medieval romance the film is punctuated with moments of graphic violence
king arthur has sent out knights to retrieve the holy grail
arthur is dismayed when it turns out that the mission was futile and knights have died in its course
among those who have returned is lancelot the lover of queen guinevere
soon lancelot again takes part in a tournament
there he gets injured
while lancelot seeks recovery in his own castle arthur learns about his wife s affair and heavily agitated by mordred he puts queen guinevere in prison
with lancelot s help she breaks out
arthur starts immediately a campaign against the castle where the lovers were looking for shelter
during the siege lancelot happens to kill his old mate gawain
driven by sorrow he tries to end the fight and wants to negotiate a treaty with king arthur
when he witnesses how mordred commits an attempt on arthur he joins without hesitating the side of the king
in the final scene many knights among whom arthur lie dead or wounded after the battle
lancelot wounded himself utters guinevere s name before falling over
