Lancelot du Lac is a French fantasy drama film written and directed by Robert Bresson It retells the story of Lancelot and Guinevere's love as Camelot and the Round Table fall apart It is based on Arthurian legend and medieval romances especially the Lancelot Grail cycle and the works of Chr tien de Troyes
In common with Bresson's later films the cast was composed of amateur actors several of whom did not appear in any other film Bresson's direction demanded a purposeful lack of emotion in the acting style and reduced or eliminated the fantastical elements of the Grail legend While much of the production is intentionally stylised as Medieval Romance the film is punctuated with moments of graphic violence
