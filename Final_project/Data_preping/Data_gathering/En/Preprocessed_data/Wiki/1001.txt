real exchange rate rer purchasing power currency relative another current exchange rate prices
ratio number unit given country's currency necessary buy market basket good country acquiring country's currency foreign exchange market number unit given country's currency would necessary buy market basket directly given country
thus real exchange rate exchange rate time relative price market basket good two countries
example purchasing power u dollar relative euro dollar price euro dollar per euro time euro price one unit market basket eurosgoods unit divided dollar price market basket dollar per good unit hence dimensionless
exchange rate expressed dollar per euro time relative price two currency term ability purchase unit market basket euro per good unit divided dollar per good unit
good freely tradable foreign domestic resident purchased identical basket good purchasing power parity ppp would hold exchange rate gdp deflator price level two country real exchange rate would always equal
rate change real exchange rate time euro versus dollar equal rate appreciation euro positive negative percentage rate change dollars-per-euro exchange rate plus inflation rate euro minus inflation rate dollar
real exchange rate rer represents nominal exchange rate adjusted relative price domestic foreign good service thus reflecting competitiveness country respect rest world
detail appreciation currency high level domestic inflation reduces rer thus reducing country's competitiveness lowering current account ca
hand currency depreciation generates opposite effect improving country's ca
evidence rer generally reach steady level long-term process faster small open economy characterized fixed exchange rates
substantial persistent rer deviation long-run equilibrium level so-called rer misalignment ha shown produce negative impact country's balance payments
overvalued rer mean current rer equilibrium value whereas undervalued rer indicates contrary
specifically prolonged rer overvaluation widely considered early sign upcoming crisis due fact country becomes vulnerable speculative attack currency crisis happened thailand asian financial crisis
side protracted rer undervaluation usually generates pressure domestic price changing consumer consumption incentive misallocating resource tradable non-tradable sectors
given rer misalignment particular overvaluation undermine country's export-oriented development strategy equilibrium rer measurement crucial policymakers
common method order estimate equilibrium rer universally accepted purchasing power parity ppp theory according rer equilibrium level assumed remain constant time
nevertheless equilibrium rer fixed value follows trend key economic fundamental different monetary fiscal policy asymmetrical shock home country abroad
consequently ppp doctrine ha largely debated year given may signal natural rer movement towards new equilibrium rer misalignment
starting order overcome limitation approach many researcher tried find alternative equilibrium rer measures
two popular approach economic literature fundamental equilibrium exchange rate feer developed williamson behavioural equilibrium exchange rate beer initially estimated clark macdonald
feer focus long-run determinant rer rather short-term cyclical speculative forces
represents rer consistent macroeconomic balance characterized achievement internal external balance time
internal balance reached level output line full employment available factor production low stable rate inflation
hand external balance hold actual future ca balance compatible long-term sustainable net capital flows
nevertheless feer viewed normative measure rer since based ideal economic condition related internal external balances
particularly since sustainable ca position defined exogenous value approach ha broadly questioned time
contrast beer entail econometric analysis rer behaviour considering significant rer deviation ppp equilibrium level consequence change key economic fundamentals
according method beer rer result economic fundamental equilibrium values
therefore total rer misalignment given extent economic fundamental differ long-run sustainable levels
short beer general approach feer since limited long-term perspective able explain rer cyclical movements
