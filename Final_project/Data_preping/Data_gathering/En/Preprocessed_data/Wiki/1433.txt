personalized medicine also referred to as precision medicine is a medical model that separates people into different groups with medical decisions practices interventions and or products being tailored to the individual patient based on their predicted response or risk of disease
the terms personalized medicine precision medicine stratified medicine and p medicine are used interchangeably to describe this concept though some authors and organisations use these expressions separately to indicate particular nuances
while the tailoring of treatment to patients dates back at least to the time of hippocrates the term has risen in usage in recent years given the growth of new diagnostic and informatics approaches that provide understanding of the molecular basis of disease particularly genomics
this provides a clear evidence base on which to stratify group related patients
among grand challenges for engineering initiative sponsored by national academy of engineering nae personalized medicine has been identified as a key and prospective approach to achieve optimal individual health decisions therefore overcoming the challenge of engineer better medicines
in personalised medicine diagnostic testing is often employed for selecting appropriate and optimal therapies based on the context of a patient s genetic content or other molecular or cellular analysis
the use of genetic information has played a major role in certain aspects of personalized medicine e g
pharmacogenomics and the term was first coined in the context of genetics though it has since broadened to encompass all sorts of personalization measures including the use of proteomics imaging analysis nanoparticle based theranostics among others
every person has a unique variation of the human genome
although most of the variation between individuals has no effect on health an individual s health stems from genetic variation with behaviors and influences from the environment
modern advances in personalized medicine rely on technology that confirms a patient s fundamental biology dna rna or protein which ultimately leads to confirming disease
for example personalised techniques such as genome sequencing can reveal mutations in dna that influence diseases ranging from cystic fibrosis to cancer
another method called rna seq can show which rna molecules are involved with specific diseases
unlike dna levels of rna can change in response to the environment
therefore sequencing rna can provide a broader understanding of a person s state of health
recent studies have linked genetic differences between individuals to rna expression translation and protein levels
the concepts of personalised medicine can be applied to new and transformative approaches to health care
personalised health care is based on the dynamics of systems biology and uses predictive tools to evaluate health risks and to design personalised health plans to help patients mitigate risks prevent disease and to treat it with precision when it occurs
the concepts of personalised health care are receiving increasing acceptance with the veterans administration committing to personalised proactive patient driven care for all veterans
in some instances personalised health care can be tailored to the markup of the disease causing agent instead of the patient s genetic markup examples are drug resistant bacteria or viruses
in order for physicians to know if a mutation is connected to a certain disease researchers often do a study called a genome wide association study gwas
a gwas study will look at one disease and then sequence the genome of many patients with that particular disease to look for shared mutations in the genome
mutations that are determined to be related to a disease by a gwas study can then be used to diagnose that disease in future patients by looking at their genome sequence to find that same mutation
the first gwas conducted in studied patients with age related macular degeneration armd
it found two different mutations each containing only a variation in only one nucleotide called single nucleotide polymorphisms or snps which were associated with armd
gwas studies like this have been very successful in identifying common genetic variations associated with diseases
as of early over gwas studies have been completed
multiple genes collectively influence the likelihood of developing many common and complex diseases
personalised medicine can also be used to predict a person s risk for a particular disease based on one or even several genes
this approach uses the same sequencing technology to focus on the evaluation of disease risk allowing the physician to initiate preventive treatment before the disease presents itself in their patient
for example if it is found that a dna mutation increases a person s risk of developing type diabetes this individual can begin lifestyle changes that will lessen their chances of developing type diabetes later in life
advances in personalised medicine will create a more unified treatment approach specific to the individual and their genome
personalised medicine may provide better diagnoses with earlier intervention and more efficient drug development and more targeted therapies
having the ability to look at a patient on an individual basis will allow for a more accurate diagnosis and specific treatment plan
genotyping is the process of obtaining an individual s dna sequence by using biological assays
by having a detailed account of an individual s dna sequence their genome can then be compared to a reference genome like that of the human genome project to assess the existing genetic variations that can account for possible diseases
a number of private companies such as andme navigenics and illumina have created direct to consumer genome sequencing accessible to the public
having this information from individuals can then be applied to effectively treat them
an individual s genetic make up also plays a large role in how well they respond to a certain treatment and therefore knowing their genetic content can change the type of treatment they receive
an aspect of this is pharmacogenomics which uses an individual s genome to provide a more informed and tailored drug prescription
often drugs are prescribed with the idea that it will work relatively the same for everyone but in the application of drugs there are a number of factors that must be considered
the detailed account of genetic information from the individual will help prevent adverse events allow for appropriate dosages and create maximum efficacy with drug prescriptions
for instance warfarin is the fda approved oral anticoagulant commonly prescribed to patients with blood clots
due to warfarin s significant interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics its rate of adverse events is among the highest of all commonly prescribed drugs
however with the discovery of polymorphic variants in cyp c and vkorc genotypes two genes that encode the individual anticoagulant response physicians can use patients gene profile to prescribe optimum doses of warfarin to prevent side effects such as major bleeding and to allow sooner and better therapeutic efficacy
the pharmacogenomic process for discovery of genetic variants that predict adverse events to a specific drug has been termed toxgnostics
an aspect of a theranostic platform applied to personalized medicine can be the use of diagnostic tests to guide therapy
the tests may involve medical imaging such as mri contrast agents t and t agents fluorescent markers organic dyes and inorganic quantum dots and nuclear imaging agents pet radiotracers or spect agents
or in vitro lab test including dna sequencing and often involve deep learning algorithms that weigh the result of testing for several biomarkers
in addition to specific treatment personalised medicine can greatly aid the advancements of preventive care
for instance many women are already being genotyped for certain mutations in the brca and brca gene if they are predisposed because of a family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer
as more causes of diseases are mapped out according to mutations that exist within a genome the easier they can be identified in an individual
measures can then be taken to prevent a disease from developing
even if mutations were found within a genome having the details of their dna can reduce the impact or delay the onset of certain diseases
having the genetic content of an individual will allow better guided decisions in determining the source of the disease and thus treating it or preventing its progression
this will be extremely useful for diseases like alzheimer s or cancers that are thought to be linked to certain mutations in our dna
a tool that is being used now to test efficacy and safety of a drug specific to a targeted patient group sub group is companion diagnostics
this technology is an assay that is developed during or after a drug is made available on the market and is helpful in enhancing the therapeutic treatment available based on the individual
these companion diagnostics have incorporated the pharmacogenomic information related to the drug into their prescription label in an effort to assist in making the most optimal treatment decision possible for the patient
having an individual s genomic information can be significant in the process of developing drugs as they await approval from the fda for public use
having a detailed account of an individual s genetic make up can be a major asset in deciding if a patient can be chosen for inclusion or exclusion in the final stages of a clinical trial
being able to identify patients who will benefit most from a clinical trial will increase the safety of patients from adverse outcomes caused by the product in testing and will allow smaller and faster trials that lead to lower overall costs
in addition drugs that are deemed ineffective for the larger population can gain approval by the fda by using personal genomes to qualify the effectiveness and need for that specific drug or therapy even though it may only be needed by a small percentage of the population
physicians commonly use a trial and error strategy until they find the treatment therapy that is most effective for their patient
with personalized medicine these treatments can be more specifically tailored by predicting how an individual s body will respond and if the treatment will work based on their genome
this has been summarized as therapy with the right drug at the right dose in the right patient such an approach would also be more cost effective and accurate
for instance tamoxifen used to be a drug commonly prescribed to women with er breast cancer but of women initially taking it developed resistance
after research by people such as david flockhart it was discovered that women with certain mutation in their cyp d gene a gene that encodes the metabolizing enzyme were not able to efficiently break down tamoxifen making it an ineffective treatment for them
women are now genotyped for these specific mutations to select the most effective treatment
screening for these mutations is carried out via high throughput screening or phenotypic screening
several drug discovery and pharmaceutical companies are currently utilizing these technologies to not only advance the study of personalised medicine but also to amplify genetic research
alternative multi target approaches to the traditional approach of forward transfection library screening can entail reverse transfection or chemogenomics
pharmacy compounding is another application of personalised medicine
though not necessarily using genetic information the customized production of a drug whose various properties e g
dose level ingredient selection route of administration etc are selected and crafted for an individual patient is accepted as an area of personalised medicine in contrast to mass produced unit doses or fixed dose combinations
computational and mathematical approaches for predicting drug interactions are also being developed
for example phenotypic response surfaces model the relationships between drugs their interactions and an individual s biomarkers
one active area of research is efficiently delivering personalized drugs generated from pharmacy compounding to the disease sites of the body
for instance researchers are trying to engineer nanocarriers that can precisely target the specific site by using real time imaging and analyzing the pharmacodynamics of the drug delivery
several candidate nanocarriers are being investigated such as iron oxide nanoparticles quantum dots carbon nanotubes gold nanoparticles and silica nanoparticles
alteration of surface chemistry allows these nanoparticles to be loaded with drugs as well as to avoid the body s immune response making nanoparticle based theranostics possible
nanocarriers targeting strategies are varied according to the disease
for example if the disease is cancer a common approach is to identify the biomarker expressed on the surface of cancer cells and to load its associated targeting vector onto nanocarrier to achieve recognition and binding the size scale of the nanocarriers will also be engineered to reach the enhanced permeability and retention effect epr in tumor targeting
if the disease is localized in the specific organ such as the kidney the surface of the nanocarriers can be coated with a certain ligand that binds to the receptors inside that organ to achieve organ targeting drug delivery and avoid non specific uptake
despite the great potential of this nanoparticle based drug delivery system the significant progress in the field is yet to be made and the nanocarriers are still being investigated and modified to meet clinical standards
theranostics is a personalised approach to treating cancer using similar molecules for both imaging diagnosis and therapy
the word theranostics is derived from the combination of the words therapeutics and diagnostics
it is now most commonly applied to the field of nuclear medicine where radioactive molecules are attached to gamma or positron emitters for spect or pet imaging and to beta alpha or auger electrons for therapy
one of the earliest examples is the use of radioactive iodine for treatment of patients with thyroid cancer
other examples include radio labelled anti cd antibodies e g
bexxar for treating lymphoma radium for treating bone metastases lutetium dotatate for treating neuroendocrine tumours and lutetium psma for treating prostate cancer
the most commonly used reagent is fluorodeoxyglucose using the isotope fluorine
radiotheranostics is a subspecialty of theranostics using similar pharmaceuticals for both imaging and therapy with radiation
the pharmaceutical or mechanism of localization action remains the same with the radionuclide being interchangeable with the diagnostic radiopharmaceutical often being a gamma or pet emitter and the therapeutic radiopharmaceutical often being a beta or alpha emitter
the terms theranostics and theragnostics are interchangeable terms with both having the same meaning and intent
similar terms radiotheranostics and radiotheragnostics are interchangeable as well
the terms are derived from the greek words thera from therapeia meaning healing or to heal e g
therapy and gnostic from greek gnos meaning knowledge and to know e g
diagnostic
dosimetry is commonly used to guide clinicians for a personalised precision therapeutic amount for each patient
respiratory diseases affect humanity globally with chronic lung diseases e g asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis among others and lung cancer causing extensive morbidity and mortality
these conditions are
highly heterogeneous and require an early diagnosis
however initial symptoms are nonspecific and the clinical diagnosis is made late frequently
over the last few years personalized medicine has emerged as a medical care approach that uses novel technology aiming to personalize treatments according to the particular patient s medical needs
in specific proteomics is used to analyze a series of protein expressions instead of a single biomarker
proteins control the body s biological activities including health and disease so proteomics is helpful in early diagnosis
in the case of respiratory disease proteomics analyzes several biological samples including serum blood cells bronchoalveolar lavage fluids bal nasal lavage fluids nlf sputum among others
the identification and quantification of complete protein expression from these biological samples are conducted by mass spectrometry and advanced analytical techniques
respiratory proteomics has made significant progress in the development of personalized medicine for supporting health care in recent years
for example in a study conducted by lazzari et al
in the proteomics based approach has made substantial improvement in identifying multiple biomarkers of lung cancer that can be used in tailoring personalized treatments for individual patients
more and more studies have demonstrated the usefulness of proteomics to provide targeted therapies for respiratory disease
over recent decades cancer research has discovered a great deal about the genetic variety of types of cancer that appear the same in traditional pathology
there has also been increasing awareness of tumour heterogeneity or genetic diversity within a single tumour
among other prospects these discoveries raise the possibility of finding that drugs that have not given good results applied to a general population of cases may yet be successful for a proportion of cases with particular genetic profiles
personalized onco genomics is the application of personalized medicine to cancer genomics or oncogenomics
high throughput sequencing methods are used to characterize genes associated with cancer to better understand disease pathology and improve drug development
oncogenomics is one of the most promising branches of genomics particularly because of its implications in drug therapy
examples of this include
trastuzumab trade names herclon herceptin is a monoclonal antibody drug that interferes with the her neu receptor
its main use is to treat certain breast cancers
this drug is only used if a patient s cancer is tested for over expression of the her neu receptor
two tissue typing tests are used to screen patients for possible benefit from herceptin treatment
the tissue tests are immunohistochemistry ihc and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish only her patients will be treated with herceptin therapy trastuzumab
tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib marketed as gleevec have been developed to treat chronic myeloid leukemia cml in which the bcr abl fusion gene the product of a reciprocal translocation between chromosome and chromosome is present in of cases and produces hyperactivated abl driven protein signaling
these medications specifically inhibit the ableson tyrosine kinase abl protein and are thus a prime example of rational drug design based on knowledge of disease pathophysiology
the foundationone cdx report produced by foundation medicine which looks at genes in individual patients tumor biopsies and recommends specific drugs
high mutation burden is indicative of response to immunotherapy and also specific patterns of mutations have been associated with previous exposure to cytotoxic cancer drugs through the use of genomics microarray proteomics tissue array and imaging fmri micro ct technologies molecular scale information about patients can be easily obtained
these so called molecular biomarkers have proven powerful in disease prognosis such as with cancer
the main three areas of cancer prediction fall under cancer recurrence cancer susceptibility and cancer survivability
combining molecular scale information with macro scale clinical data such as patients tumor type and other risk factors significantly improves prognosis
consequently given the use of molecular biomarkers especially genomics cancer prognosis or prediction has become very effective especially when screening a large population
essentially population genomics screening can be used to identify people at risk for disease which can assist in preventative efforts
genetic data can be used to construct polygenic scores which estimate traits such as disease risk by summing the estimated effects of individual variants discovered through a gwas
these have been used for a wide variety of conditions such as cancer diabetes and coronary artery disease
many genetic variants are associated with ancestry and it remains a challenge to both generate accurate estimates and to decouple biologically relevant variants from those that are coincidentally associated
estimates generated from one population do not usually transfer well to others requiring sophisticated methods and more diverse and global data
most studies have used data from those with european ancestry leading to calls for more equitable genomics practices to reduce health disparities
additionally while polygenic scores have some predictive accuracy their interpretations are limited to estimating an individual s percentile and translational research is needed for clinical use
as personalised medicine is practiced more widely a number of challenges arise
the current approaches to intellectual property rights reimbursement policies patient privacy data biases and confidentiality as well as regulatory oversight will have to be redefined and restructured to accommodate the changes personalised medicine will bring to healthcare
for instance a survey performed in the uk concluded that of uk adults are not comfortable with their personal data being used for the sake of utilizing ai in the medical field
furthermore the analysis of acquired diagnostic data is a recent challenge of personalized medicine and its implementation
for example genetic data obtained from next generation sequencing requires computer intensive data processing prior to its analysis
in the future adequate tools will be required to accelerate the adoption of personalised medicine to further fields of medicine which requires the interdisciplinary cooperation of experts from specific fields of research such as medicine clinical oncology biology and artificial intelligence
the fda has already started to take initiatives to integrate personalised medicine into their regulatory policies
an fda report in october entitled paving the way for personalized medicine fda s role in a new era of medical product development in which they outlined steps they would have to take to integrate genetic and biomarker information for clinical use and drug development
they determined that they would have to develop specific regulatory science standards research methods reference material and other tools in order to incorporate personalised medicine into their current regulatory practices
for example they are working on a genomic reference library for regulatory agencies to compare and test the validity of different sequencing platforms in an effort to uphold reliability
a major challenge for those regulating personalized medicine is a way to demonstrate its effectiveness relative to the current standard of care
the new technology must be assessed for both clinical and cost effectiveness and as it stands regulatory agencies have no standardized method
as with any innovation in medicine investment and interest in personalised medicine is influenced by intellectual property rights
there has been a lot of controversy regarding patent protection for diagnostic tools genes and biomarkers
in june the u s supreme court ruled that natural occurring genes cannot be patented while synthetic dna that is edited or artificially created can still be patented
the patent office is currently reviewing a number of issues related to patent laws for personalised medicine such as whether confirmatory secondary genetic tests post initial diagnosis can have full immunity from patent laws
those who oppose patents argue that patents on dna sequences are an impediment to ongoing research while proponents point to research exemption and stress that patents are necessary to entice and protect the financial investments required for commercial research and the development and advancement of services offered
reimbursement policies will have to be redefined to fit the changes that personalised medicine will bring to the healthcare system
some of the factors that should be considered are the level of efficacy of various genetic tests in the general population cost effectiveness relative to benefits how to deal with payment systems for extremely rare conditions and how to redefine the insurance concept of shared risk to incorporate the effect of the newer concept of individual risk factors
the study barriers to the use of personalized medicine in breast cancer took two different diagnostic tests which are bracanalysis and oncotype dx
these tests have over ten day turnaround times which results in the tests failing and delays in treatments
patients are not being reimbursed for these delays which results in tests not being ordered
ultimately this leads to patients having to pay out of pocket for treatments because insurance companies do not want to accept the risks involved
perhaps the most critical issue with the commercialization of personalised medicine is the protection of patients
one of the largest issues is the fear and potential consequences for patients who are predisposed after genetic testing or found to be non responsive towards certain treatments
this includes the psychological effects on patients due to genetic testing results
the right of family members who do not directly consent is another issue considering that genetic predispositions and risks are inheritable
the implications for certain ethnic groups and presence of a common allele would also have to be considered
moreover we could refer to the privacy issue at all layers of personalized medicine from discovery to treatment
one of the leading issues is the consent of the patients to have their information used in genetic testing algorithms primarily ai algorithms
the consent of the institution who is providing the data to be used is of prominent concern as well
in the genetic information nondiscrimination act gina was passed in an effort to minimize the fear of patients participating in genetic research by ensuring that their genetic information will not be misused by employers or insurers
on february fda issued a press release titled fda permits marketing of first direct to consumer genetic carrier test for bloom syndrome
data biases also play an integral role in personalized medicine
it is important to ensure that the sample of genes being tested come from different populations
this is to ensure that the samples do not exhibit the same human biases we use in decision making
consequently if the designed algorithms for personalized medicine are biased then the outcome of the algorithm will also be biased because of the lack of genetic testing in certain populations
for instance the results from the framingham heart study have led to biased outcomes of predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease
this is because the sample was tested only on white people and when applied to the non white population the results were biased with overestimation and underestimation risks of cardiovascular disease
several issues must be addressed before personalized medicine can be implemented
very little of the human genome has been analyzed and even if healthcare providers had access to a patient s full genetic information very little of it could be effectively leveraged into treatment
challenges also arise when processing such large amounts of genetic data
even with error rates as low as per kilobases processing a human genome could have roughly errors
this many errors especially when trying to identify specific markers can make discoveries and verifiability difficult
there are methods to overcome this but they are computationally taxing and expensive
there are also issues from an effectiveness standpoint as after the genome has been processed function in the variations among genomes must be analyzed using genome wide studies
while the impact of the snps discovered in these kinds of studies can be predicted more work must be done to control for the vast amounts of variation that can occur because of the size of the genome being studied
in order to effectively move forward in this area steps must be taken to ensure the data being analyzed is good and a wider view must be taken in terms of analyzing multiple snps for a phenotype
the most pressing issue that the implementation of personalized medicine is to apply the results of genetic mapping to improve the healthcare system
this is not only due to the infrastructure and technology required for a centralized database of genome data but also the physicians that would have access to these tools would likely be unable to fully take advantage of them
in order to truly implement a personalized medicine healthcare system there must be an end to end change
