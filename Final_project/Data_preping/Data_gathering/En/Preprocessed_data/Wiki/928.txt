prostitution in taiwan was made illegal under a law
legislation was introduced in to allow local governments in taiwan to set up special zones where prostitution is permitted
outside these zones prostitution is illegal
as of no special zones had been opened
during the period of japanese rule geisha houses and brothels were authorized to operate in certain districts of taiwan
later geishas evolved into hostesses
as late as the s many girls who were indentured by their parents into prostitution for financial reasons consented out of filial piety
during world war ii the japanese recruited or coerced women into serving as comfort women
during this period korean women came to work as prostitutes for the japanese in taiwan or were coerced into sexual slavery
when the republic of china took control in the chinese nationalist government initially banned most hostesses and prostitutes labeling prostitution an immoral practice encouraged by the japanese
at the same time however the ministry of defense maintained official brothels on outer islands to provide sexual services to the many single military men who arrived from china in
in the government revived the policy of registering and licensing prostitutes under the measures for the administration of taiwan province of prostitutes
rapid industrialization in the s brought an influx of young people into the cities giving rise to a coffee house subculture where female hostesses catered to young male workers
at roughly the same time the opening of two u s
army bases spawned bars and dance halls to cater to the american military population
government concern over immorality led to increased police attention directed at intimacy in public and sometimes in private
the sex trade became increasingly controversial in the government stopped licensing new brothels and in the s a campaign aimed at rescuing taiwanese aborigine girls forced into prostitution grew into an anti prostitution movement that successfully lobbied for outright banning of prostitution across taiwan
the last jurisdiction to outlaw prostitution was the city of taipei in under mayor chen shui bian
however chen lost the next election and his successor ma ying jeou allowed a grace period that extended to april
sex work became illegal in taiwan under article of the social order and maintenance act which replaced the police offence law of the s and criminalized the mainly female population of sex workers
sex workers could be detained for a maximum of three days fined up to nt or sent to a correctional institution for a period of between and months
chen who outlawed sex work in taipei in was president from to
during this time sex workers were prosecuted and advocates like josephine ho also faced discrimination from conservative groups
after a long public debate
cheng li wun introduced a bill in april to decriminalize sex work
in june in response to sex workers demands and academic research and citing a commitment to bring taiwan s legislation into harmony with the international covenant on civil and political rights and the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights the ma ying jeou administration announced that prostitution was to be decriminalized according to jiang yi huah minister of the research development and evaluation commission
announcing that article would be abolished on the grounds of treating prostitution as a matter of human rights the government concluded that punishing sexual transactions only forced them underground leaving sex workers open to abuse
the government stated that while sexual transactions between consenting adults should be governed by personal educational and religious considerations rather than by laws the sex trade should be regulated like any other occupation
the law was also felt to be largely ineffectual
it left the question of where people could engage in prostitution up to local governments
regulations were promised within six months which were to be mainly the responsibility of local government
in the meantime jail terms were to be replaced by fines and police officers would no longer be credited for the arrest of sex workers
subsequent to this the constitutional court declared the existing legislation unconstitutional and ordered that it cease to be in effect within years
again government officials stated there were plans to decriminalize sex work
this was the first pronouncement by the ministry of the interior on the subject but plans to allow local red light districts were opposed by taipei s mayor hau lung bin
however in the government was still debating the subject
in october the government announced it was planning to allow small brothels to operate while meanwhile the laws were no longer being enforced
in may the government announced that a draft bill was imminent
taiwan s approach created renewed hope for those advocating for more liberal policies in china
in taiwan the public narrowly supported the initiative but it was opposed by some women s groups such as the garden of hope foundation
prostitution in taiwan is illegal except in special zones but no special zones have been opened
foreign prostitutes caught by police are charged with prostitution rather than illegal work by foreign national which implies illegality
