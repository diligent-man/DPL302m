organ dysfunction is a condition where an organ does not perform its expected function
organ failure is organ dysfunction to such a degree that normal homeostasis cannot be maintained without external clinical intervention
it is not a diagnosis
it can be classified by the cause but when the cause is not known it can also be classified by whether the onset is chronic or acute
multiple organ failure can be associated with sepsis and is often fatal
countries such as spain have shown a rise in mortality risk due to a large elderly population there
however there are tools physicians use when diagnosing multiple organ failure and when prognosing the outcome
the sequential organ failure assessment sofa score uses early lab values in a patient s hospitalization within hours to predict fatal outcomes for a patient
