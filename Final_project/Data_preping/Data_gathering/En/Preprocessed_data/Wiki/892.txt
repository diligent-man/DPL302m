The United States secretary of defense SecDef is the head of the United States Department of Defense the executive department of the US
Armed Forces and is a high ranking member of the federal cabinet
The secretary of defense's position of command and authority over the military is second only to that of the president of the United States who is the commander-in-chief
This position corresponds to what is generally known as a defense minister in many other countries
The secretary of defense is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate and is by custom a member of the Cabinet and by law a member of the National Security Council
The secretary of defense is a statutory office and the general provision in USC § provides that subject to the direction of the President its occupant has authority direction and control over the Department of Defense
The same statute further designates the secretary as the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to the Department of Defense
To ensure civilian control of the military no one may be appointed as the secretary of defense within seven years of serving as a commissioned officer of a regular military component ie non-reserve without a waiver from Congress
Subject only to the orders of the president the secretary of defense is in the chain of command and exercises command and control for both operational and administrative purposes over all service branches administered by the Department of Defense the Army Marine Corps Navy Air Force and Space Force as well as the Coast Guard when its command and control is transferred to the Department of Defense
Only the secretary of defense or the president or Congress can authorize the transfer of operational control of forces between the three military departments Department of the Army the Navy and the Air Force and the eleven Unified Combatant Commands
Because the secretary of defense is vested with legal powers that exceed those of any commissioned officer and is second only to the president in the military hierarchy its incumbent has sometimes unofficially been referred to as deputy commander-in-chief
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the principal military adviser to the secretary of defense and the president while the chairman may assist the secretary and president in their command functions the chairman is not in the chain of command
The secretary of state the secretary of the treasury the secretary of defense and the attorney general are generally regarded as the four most important cabinet officials because of the size and importance of their respective departments
The current secretary of defense is retired general Lloyd Austin who is the first African American to serve in the position
An Army Navy and Marine Corps were established in in concurrence with the American Revolution
The War Department headed by the secretary of war was created by Act of Congress in and was responsible for both the Army and Navy until the founding of a separate Department of the Navy in
Based on the experiences of World War II proposals were soon made on how to more effectively manage the large combined military establishment
The Army generally favored centralization while the Navy had institutional preferences for decentralization and the status quo
The resulting National Security Act of was largely a compromise between these divergent viewpoints
It renamed the Department of War the Department of the Army and added both it and the Department of the Navy to a newly established National Military Establishment NME
The Act also separated the Army Air Forces from the Army to become its own branch of service the United States Air Force
A new title was coined by the Act for the head of the NME Secretary of Defense
At first each of the service secretaries maintained cabinet status
The first secretary of defense James Forrestal who in his previous capacity as the secretary of the Navy had opposed the creation of the new position found it difficult to exercise authority over the other branches with the limited powers his office had at the time
To address this and other problems the National Security Act was amended in to further consolidate the national defense structure in order to reduce interservice rivalry directly subordinate the secretaries of the Army the Navy and the Air Force to the secretary of defense in the chain of command and rename the National Military Establishment as the Department of Defense making it one Executive Department
The position of the deputy secretary of defense the number two position in the department was also created at this time
The general trend since has been to further centralize management in the Department of Defense elevating the status and authorities of civilian OSD appointees and defense-wide organizations at the expense of the military departments and the services within them
The last major revision of the statutory framework concerning the position was done in the GoldwaterNichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of
In particular it elevated the status of joint service for commissioned officers making it in practice a requirement before appointments to general officer and flag officer grades could be made
As the secretary of defense is a civilian position intended to be independent of the active-duty leadership a secretary is required to have been retired from service for at least seven originally ten years unless a waiver is approved by Congress
Since the creation of the position in such a waiver has been approved only three times for Army general George Marshall in Marine Corps General Jim Mattis in and retired Army general Lloyd J
The secretary of defense appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate is by federal law USC § the head of the Department of Defense the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to Department of Defense and has authority direction and control over the Department of Defense
Because the Constitution vests all military authority in Congress and the president the statutory authority of the secretary of defense is derived from their constitutional authorities
Since it is impractical for either Congress or the president to participate in every piece of Department of Defense affairs the secretary of defense and the secretary's subordinate officials generally exercise military authority
As the head of DoD all officials employees and service members are under the secretary of defense
