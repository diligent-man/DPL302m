when a user joined aardvark aardvark was added to the user s im buddylist
users submitted questions by email or im
aardvark guided the user through the question process by providing messages that confirmed receipt of the question and explained any actions required of the user
im users were able to use a variety of im commands one word messages that could be used to fine tune the question parameters invite new users or get help
there were two main interaction flows available in aardvark for answering a question
the primary flow involved aardvark sending a message to the user via im email etc asking if the user would like to answer a question
periodically aardvark contacted users via email or im when it believed they were well suited to answer another user s question
aardvark searched through one s friends and friends friends also
instead of sending the question to every friend it found it searched a person s profile to see if there were information related to the question
when aardvark sent a question to the user if the user responded affirmatively aardvark relayed the question as well as the name of the questioner
the user could then simply type an answer to the question a friend s name or email address to refer to someone who may know the answer or simply type in pass to pass on the request
aardvark sent such requests for answers less than once a day to a given user and users could easily change contact settings specify preferred frequency and time of the day for such requests
aardvark supported google talk windows live messenger aol instant messenger and yahoo messenger
a secondary flow of answering questions was more similar to traditional bulletin board style interactions a user sent a message to aardvark or visited the answering tab of the website aardvark showed the user a recent question from the user s network which had not yet been answered and which was related to the user s profile topics
this mode involved the user initiating the exchange when the user was in the mood to try to answer a question as such it had the benefit of tapping into users who acted as eager potential answerers
in all of the interfaces wrappers around messages from another user included information about the user to facilitate trust the user s real name age gender the social connection between the two users a section of topics the user had expertise in and summary statistics of the user s activity on aardvark
