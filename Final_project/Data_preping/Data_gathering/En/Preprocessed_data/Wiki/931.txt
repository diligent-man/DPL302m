charles henry noll january june was an american professional football player and head coach
regarded as one of the greatest head coaches of all time his sole head coaching position was for the pittsburgh steelers of the national football league nfl from to
when noll retired after years only three other head coaches in nfl history had longer tenures with one team
after a seven year playing career that included two nfl championships as a member of his hometown cleveland browns and several years as an assistant coach with various teams in noll took the helm of the then moribund steelers which had played in only one post season game in its previous years a loss and turned it into a perennial contender
as a head coach noll won four super bowls four afc titles and nine central division championships compiled a overall record a playoff record and had winning records in of his final seasons
his four super bowl victories rank second behind bill belichick for the most of any head coach in nfl history
his four super bowl wins are the most ever by a coach without a super bowl loss
between his playing and coaching tenures noll won a total of seven nfl championships as well as one afl championship and was elected to the pro football hall of fame in his first year of eligibility
noll built the team through astute drafting and meticulous tutoring
during his career he was notable for the opportunities he gave african americans starting the first black quarterback in franchise history and hiring one of the first black assistant coaches in league history
he was often credited with maintaining the morale of the western pennsylvania region despite its steep economic decline by creating a team of champions in the image of its blue collar fan base
noll was born in cleveland ohio the youngest of three siblings by eight years of william noll a butcher frequently unable to work owing to parkinson s disease and katherine steigerwald noll who worked for a florist
the family lived in the house noll s mother grew up in with her siblings near east th street in a neighborhood with a large african american population a fact that helps account for noll s early championing of opportunity for african americans in the nfl both players from traditionally black colleges and later as coaches
on a local youth football team noll played with harold owens the nephew of olympic star jesse owens
noll attended benedictine high school
he began working in seventh grade and by the time he entered high school he had saved enough for two year s worth of the tuition
throughout high school he continued to work making cent an hour at fisher brothers meat market after school
education was always important to him so despite the schedule he studied enough to graduate th in a class of
he played running back and tackle on the high school football team winning all state honors
during his senior year he was named to the all catholic universe bulletin team by the diocese of cleveland newspaper
noll planned to attend notre dame but during a practice before his freshman year he suffered an epileptic seizure on the field
notre dame coach frank leahy refused to take the risk of allowing noll to play there and so noll accepted a football scholarship to the university of dayton
noll graduated with a degree in secondary education
as a member of the flyers he was a lineman linebacker and a co captain and acquired the nickname the pope for his infallible grasp of the game
noll was selected by the cleveland browns in the th round of the nfl draft th overall
during his first year the browns lost to the detroit lions in the nfl championship
the next two years the browns were nfl champions
although the undersized noll was drafted as a linebacker coach paul brown used him as one of his messenger guards to send play calls to the quarterback beginning with otto graham
brown recalled that noll soon could have called the plays himself without any help from the bench
that s how smart he was according to art rooney jr
director of scouting for the steelers before and during most of noll s tenure however noll felt demeaned by brown s use of him in that way and disliked the term messenger boy so much that as coach of the steelers he entrusted all the play calling to his quarterbacks
noll was paid only per season with the browns and so while there he acted as substitute teacher at holy name high school and sold insurance on the side
during that period noll also attended cleveland marshall college of law at night
he told dan rooney that he decided against becoming a lawyer because he didn t really like the constant confrontation and arguments that come with being a lawyer
instead when noll lost the starting guard position to john wooten he chose to retire at age expecting to begin his coaching career at his alma mater
he was surprised however when he was not offered an open position on the university of dayton coaching staff
he was offered a position by sid gillman on the staff of the los angeles chargers during its inaugural season
noll was an assistant coach for the american football league s then los angeles and later san diego chargers from to
he then became assistant to head coach don shula of the nfl baltimore colts from to when he was selected as the pittsburgh steelers head coach
noll is considered part of sid gillman s coaching tree
he later remembered gillman as one of the game s prime researchers and offensive specialists
in six years i had more exposure to football than i normally would have received in years during noll s six year tenure with the chargers where he was defensive line coach the defensive backfield coach and defensive coordinator the team appeared in five afl championship games
gillman said that noll had a great way with players specifically if a guy didn t do the job expected chuck could climb on his back massive defensive tackle ernie ladd said that noll was a fiery guy but also the best teacher i ever played under he and i were always fighting always squabbling but he had a great way of teaching
i take my hat off to chuck
he was one of the main reasons for our success the defensive line under noll became known as the fearsome foursome and during defensive end earl faison was named afl rookie of the year
during noll s time at chargers al davis was also an assistant and scout
davis would later become coach and general manager of the oakland raiders the principal afc rival of the steelers in the s
with the colts noll was defensive backfield coach and later defensive coordinator
together with assistant coach bill arnsparger the colts employed shifting alignments of rotating zone and maximum blitz defensive packages
in noll s last season as defensive coordinator the baltimore colts compiled a record in the regular season and tied the nfl season record for fewest points allowed
shula was impressed by noll s approach he explained how to do things and wrote up the technique
he was one of the first coaches i was around that wrote up in great detail all of the techniques used by players for example the backpedal and the defensive back s position on the receiver
he was like a classroom teacher
the colts won the nfl championship by routing the cleveland browns in cleveland but were shocked by the upstart afl champion new york jets in super bowl iii at the orange bowl in miami
the next day noll interviewed for the head coach position in pittsburgh
at age noll was named the th head coach of the pittsburgh steelers on january after penn state coach joe paterno turned down an offer for the position
at the time of his hiring he was the youngest head coach in the nfl
steelers owner art rooney would later credit don shula as the person who recommended noll as a head coach
noll implemented a defensive system in pittsburgh that became the legendary steel curtain defense
his coaching style earned him the nickname of the emperor chaz by sports announcer myron cope
noll was the first head coach to win four super bowls ix x xiii xiv
the key to noll s coaching success during this run was the steelers skill in selecting outstanding players in the nfl college player draft
noll s first round one pick was joe greene a defensive tackle from north texas state who went on to become a perennial all pro and anchor the defensive line
during the next few years the steelers drafted quarterback terry bradshaw louisiana tech and running back franco harris penn state as round one picks
in the draft noll and the steelers achieved a level of drafting success never seen before or since when they selected four future hall of fame players with their first five picks wide receivers lynn swann and john stallworth middle linebacker jack lambert and center mike webster
to this day no other draft by any team has included more than two future hall of famers
a meticulous coach noll was known during practice to dwell on fundamentals such as the three point stance things that professional players were expected to know
for instance andy russell already a pro bowl linebacker before noll arrived and one of the few players noll kept after purging the roster his first year was told by noll that he didn t have his feet positioned right
as a result of noll s attention to detail russell went on to become a key member for the first two super bowl teams and started the linebacker tradition that continues today in pittsburgh
noll was a well read man who valued education and expected likewise from his team so he sought players who studied useful or practical subjects in college and had interests outside of football
i didn t want to pick guys who just took wood shop or some other easy course they could breeze through to play football he explained
while most of his contemporaries as well as current nfl head coaches enforced strict curfew rules on its players noll was very lax on off the field behavior
this was shown at super bowl ix
while noll s counterpart minnesota vikings head coach bud grant strictly kept his team in their hotel rooms except for practice before the game noll told his team upon arriving in new orleans to go out on bourbon street and get the partying out of your system now
the hallmark of the team during the s was a stifling defense known as the steel curtain
linemen l
greenwood joe greene as well as ernie holmes and dwight white linebackers jack ham and jack lambert had a collective level of talent unseen before in the nfl
the teams that won super bowls ix and x used a run oriented offense primarily featuring franco harris and blocking back rocky bleier
over the next few years terry bradshaw matured into an outstanding passer and the teams that won super bowls xiii and xiv fully utilized the receiving tandem of lynn swann and john stallworth
noll was notoriously shy and did not like the media or give many interviews
his s teams were so talented that his contributions as head coach and architect of the team often were overlooked
the first half of the s would see the team continue their excellence making the playoffs for three straight years from to even as they failed to reach the super bowl but as the team facing a spate of injuries and departures to their super bowl winning teams by the decade s second half began to skid and would see three losing seasons from the years to
in noll finally achieved some recognition as nfl coach of the year when he guided the steelers into the second round of the playoffs
the team was not especially talented and lost its first two regular season games by scores of and
however noll did a remarkable job in keeping the team focused and steadily improving its play as they made the playoffs and played competitively in two playoff games noll went a combined in his last two seasons at the helm of the steelers
noll retired as steelers head coach after the season with a record of regular season and postseason combined
he was elected to the pro football hall of fame in
the last team he coached gave him a gift of a stationary bicycle which he avidly used
noll maintained a residence in suburban pittsburgh however he spent some time at his florida home
his mobility was limited by chronic back problems
noll held the ceremonial title of administration adviser in the pittsburgh steelers front office but had no real role in the team s operations after his retirement
he spent about half the year in pittsburgh with his wife marianne
their son chris is a teacher in a private high school in connecticut
noll died of natural causes in his suburban pittsburgh condo on june having suffered for years from alzheimer s disease a heart condition and back problems
noll s funeral was held on june at st

noll s legacy includes providing opportunities for african americans
under noll joe gilliam became the league s first african american starting quarterback just a few seasons after the afl started marlin briscoe and james harris gilliam started ahead of terry bradshaw briefly during the season
in franco harris became the first african american to win the super bowl mvp award
during the s tony dungy who briefly played under noll in the late s got his start as an nfl assistant coach initially as the steelers defensive backs coach and later he became the first african american coordinator in the nfl
noll strongly promoted dungy as a well qualified head coaching candidate but it did not happen for dungy with the steelers when noll retired after the season
however dungy did become head coach of the tampa bay buccaneers and later became the first african american coach to win a super bowl xli with the indianapolis colts
on august the field at st
vincent seminary in latrobe pennsylvania was dedicated and renamed chuck noll field in honor of the former coach
