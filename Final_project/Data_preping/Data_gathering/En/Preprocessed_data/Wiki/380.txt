Screen Actors Guild Awards (also known as SAG Awards) are accolades given by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)
The award was founded in 1952 to recognize outstanding performances in movie and prime time television
SAG Awards have been one of the major awards events in the Hollywood film industry since 1995
The awards focus on both individual performances as well as on the work of the entire ensemble of a drama series and comedy series, and the cast of a motion picture.
Nominations for the awards come from two committees, one for film and one for television, each numbering 2100 members of the union, randomly selected anew each year, with the full membership (165,000 as of 2012) available to vote for the winners
It is considered an indicator of success at the Academy Awards in acting categories
The awards have been telecast since 1998 on TNT, and since 2007 have been simulcast on TBS.
The inaugural SAG Awards aired live on February 25, 1995, from Universal Studios' Stage 12
The second SAG awards aired live from the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, while subsequent awards have been held at the Shrine Auditorium
On December 4, 2017, it was announced that the award show would have its first host ever in its twenty-four year history with actress Kristen Bell presiding over the ceremony
As of 2021, Shakespeare in Love is the only film to receive nominations for all four acting categories and the ensemble award.
The statuette given, a nude male figure holding both a mask of comedy and a mask of tragedy, is called "The Actor"
It is 16 inches (41 cm) tall, weighs over 12 pounds (5.4 kg), is cast in solid bronze, and produced by the American Fine Arts Foundry in Burbank, California.
