The Third Order of Saint Francis is a third order in the Franciscan tradition of Christianity, founded by the medieval Italian Catholic friar Francis of Assisi.
The preaching of Francis and his disciples caused many married men and women to want to join the Franciscan First Order as friar or the Second Order as a nun
This being incompatible with their state of life, Francis found a middle way: in 1221 he gave them a rule animated by the Franciscan spirit
Those following this rule became members of the Franciscan Third Order, sometimes called tertiaries.
The Third Order is divided into Third Order Regulars, who live in religious congregations, and Third Order Seculars or the Secular Franciscan Order, who live in fraternities
The latter do not wear a religious habit, take vows, or live in community, but gather together in community on a regular basis
In 1978, the Catholic Third Order of Saint Francis was reorganised and given a new Rule of Life by Pope Paul VI.
Apart from the Third Order of Saint Francis in Catholicism, the Lutheran and Anglican traditions also have Franciscan third orders.
Tertiaries (from the Latin tertiarius, relative to "third"), or what are known as "Third Orders", are those who live according to the Third Rule of religious orders, either inside or outside of a religious community
The idea which forms the basis of this institute is to allow those who cannot enter a religious order to enjoy the advantages and privileges of religious orders.
When the immediate disciples of the saint had become an order bound by the religious vows, it became necessary to provide for the great body of laity, married men and women, who could not leave the world or abandon their avocations, but still were part of the Franciscan movement and desired to carry out in their lives its spirit and teaching
And so, probably in 1221, Francis drew up a Rule for those of his followers who were debarred from being members of the order of Friars Minor
At first they were called "Brothers and Sisters of the Order of Penance"; but later on, when the Friars were called the "First Order" and the nuns the "Second Order", the Order of Penance became the "Third Order of St
Francis" whence the name Tertiaries
According to the traditions of the Order, the original Rule was given by St
Francis in 1221 to a married couple, Luchesius Modestini and his wife, Buonadonna, who wished to follow him but did not feel called to separate as a married couple.
Francis was assisted by his friend Cardinal Ugolino (later Pope Gregory IX) in the creation of the order
Immediately on its establishment in 1221 the Third Order spread rapidly all over Italy and throughout western Europe, and embraced multitudes of men and women of all ranks from highest to lowest
Everywhere it was connected closely with the First Order.
Because of the prohibition of bearing arms, the followers of this order came into conflict with local authorities and the feudal system of Italy, which customarily required men to carry arms for service in militias or for their lords
By the 13th century, local Third Order Confraternities with variations had been established
In 1289 Pope Nicholas IV confirmed the religious order in the bull Supra montem, and put the Third Order under the care of the Friars Minor.
The Third Order was created by Francis of Assisi, and was the exemplar after which the others were fashioned; but at an early date the other Mendicant Orders formed Third Orders on the same lines, and so there came into being Dominican Tertiaries, and Carmelite, and Augustinian, and Servite, and also Premonstratensian and many others
These followed the same lines of development as the Franciscan Tertiaries, and for the most part divided into the two branches of regular and secular Tertiaries
The Rules of the various Third Orders have proved very adaptable to the needs of modern congregations devoted to active works of charity; and so a great number of teaching and nursing congregations of women belong to one or other of the Third Orders.
By the 15th century, numerous individuals living under the Rule of the Third Order were living in small communities and leading eremitical lives
A papal decree of 1447 organized the more isolated communities into a new and separate religious order with its own rule of life
The Third Order became defined between the Third Order Regular (TOR.; i.e
living under a Regula or "Rule") and the Third Order Secular, for those members of the Order who lived in the world.
The Franciscan Third Order was always the principal one, and it received a great impetus and a renewed vogue from Pope Leo XIII in 1883, in his approval of a new Rule for the seculars
In 1901 Paul Sabatier published a "Rule of Life of the Brothers and Sisters of Penance," which probably contained, with additions, the substance of the original Rule of 1221
It prescribed severe simplicity of dress and of life, and certain abstinences and prayers and other religious exercises, and forbade the frequentation of the theatre, the bearing of arms and the taking of oaths except when administered by magistrates.
In the nineteenth century many new congregations adopted the Rule of the Third Order without connection with the First Order
In 1978 Pope Paul VI caused the separate Rules for both regulars and seculars to be recast and made more suitable for the requirements of devout men and women at the present day
The secular wing of the Order was renamed as the Secular Franciscan Order.
After the Reformation, Franciscan third orders aligned with the Lutheran Churches and Anglican Communion were organized, such as the Evangelical Franciscans Tertiaries (Evangelischen Franziskaner-Tertiaren), which was founded in 1927 by Friedrich Heiler, a Lutheran priest in Germany.
The Secular Franciscan Order (Ordo Franciscanus Saecularis in Latin), formerly the Third Order Secular, allows both laypeople and diocesan priests to join
A number of Popes have also been members of this Order
Members of the Secular Franciscan Order are not required to live in religious community, but meet in community regularly
Professed members use the letters OFS after their name
Presently there are about 350,000 members worldwide.
The current rule was given by Pope Paul VI in 1978 with the ecclesiastical letter Seraphicus Patriarcha to adapt the Secular Franciscan Order to 20th century needs
Under the new Rule, the tertiaries of the Franciscan movement were set up as an autonomous Order, with their own Minister General as head and became a fully recognized order within the Catholic church
The order's name was changed from the Third Order Secular to the Secular Franciscan Order.
The origin of the Regular Third Order can be traced back to the second half of the thirteenth century
It was organized, in different forms, in the Netherlands, the south of France, Germany, and Italy
Probably some secular tertiaries, who in many cases had their house of meeting, gradually withdrew entirely from the world and formed religious communities, but without the three substantial vows of religious orders
Other religious associations such as the Beguines (women) and Beghards (men) in the Low Countries sometimes became Third Orders.
Throughout the fourteenth century, the regular tertiaries of both sexes had in the most cases no common organization; only in the following century did single well-ordered religious communities with solemn vows and a common head develop
Pope Martin V submitted in 1428 all tertiaries, regular and secular, to the direction of the Minister-General of the Friars Minor, but this disposition was soon revoked by his successor Pope Eugene IV
Leo X, to introduce uniformity into the numerous congregations, gave a new form to the rule in 1521
It retained the rule as published by Nicholas IV all that could serve the purpose, but added new points, such as the three solemn vows and insisting on subjection to the First Order of St
Francis
For this last disposition the Rule of Leo X was met with resistance, and never was accepted by some congregations.
More than 448 congregations profess the "Rule and Life of the Brothers and Sisters of the Third Order Regular of St
Francis." There are 18 male congregations of Tertiary Franciscans, 370 congregations of Franciscan Sisters and 60 monasteries of cloistered nuns
The Third Order congregations of men and women number over 200,000.
A new Rule, written by friars and sisters of various congregations, was approved by Pope Paul VI in 1978
It is the current Rule followed by all congregations of the Third Order Regular.
It was not until the 15th century that there developed single well-ordered religious communities with solemn vows and a common head
In the 15th century there were numerous independent male congregations of regular tertiaries with the three vows in Italy, Sicily, Dalmatia, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, and in the Netherlands.
The Obregonians, or the "Minim Congregation of Poor Brothers Infirmarians", were a small Spanish Roman Catholic congregation of men dedicated to the nursing care of the sick
The congregation ceased to exist around the time of the Peninsular War.
The Congregation of the Brothers of the Poor of St
Francis was founded Christmas Day 1857, at Aachen by John Hoever for the protection and education of poor, homeless boys, In 1866, it was introduced into the United States, where orphanages for boys were established in Teutopolis, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Cincinnati, Ohio (1868) and Cold Spring, Kentucky (1869), through the generosity of Sarah Worthington Peter
The order's motherhouse remains in Aachen and the order maintains houses in Brazil, Holland and the United States.
The Franciscan Brothers of the Holy Cross (FFSC) were founded by Brother James Wirth in 1862 in Hausen, Germany, to care for orphans, the poor, the sick, and the suffering
In 1891, three Brothers settled in Bad Kreuznach, where they eventually took over a local hospital, now known as St
Marienw√∂rth
The Brothers were invited to come to the Diocese of Springfield, Illinois in 1928 to establish a Monastery and a Trade School

Joseph's motherhouse is in Hausen.

The Capuchin Tertiary Friars of Our Lady of Sorrows, and more commonly as the Amigonian Friars, were founded in Spain in 1889 by the Capuchin Friar Luis Amig√≥ y Ferrer, later bishop, in Spain
They were established through Amig√≥'s desire to help the young boys he saw caught up in the Spanish penal system
They soon established reform schools and trade schools to help these boys
In 1986 they took over the administration of two youth facilities in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
In 1835 a Franciscan Monastery was built in Roundstone, County Galway.
In 1858 Bishop John Loughlin issued an invitation to the Brothers of the monastery to operate schools for the boys of the Diocese of Brooklyn.
There were also congregations of religious sisters of the Third Order; for instance, the Grey Sisters of the Third Order, serving in hospitals, spread in France and the Netherlands
In 1403 Elizabeth of Reute and several other young women who were Franciscan tertiaries, under the guidance of Dom Konrad K√ºgelin, provost of the Canonry of St
Peter in Waldsee, acquired a house in Reute on the outskirts of Waldsee
This community was a proto-monastery of the Order, as tertiaries of the mendicant orders had not yet been allowed to profess vows.
Angelina of Marsciano is generally credited with the founding of the Third Order Regular for women around 1403, as her religious congregation marked the establishment of the first Franciscan community of women living under the Rule of the Third Order Regular authorized by Pope Nicholas V
Unlike the Second Order of the Franciscan movement, the Poor Clare nuns, they were not an enclosed religious order, and lived under the authority of the local bishop of the diocese.
Whilst Leo X in the reform of the rule had left it free to the congregations to adopt papal enclosure or not, Pius V (1568) prescribed it to all convents of tertiary sisters with solemn vows
Still this order was not carried out everywhere
In this regard the custom prevailed that the Friars Minor refused to take the direction of those convents which had only episcopal enclosure
Besides those already mentioned above, we may add the different offshoots of the Sisters of St
Elizabeth in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and France (there, under the name of Soeurs du Refuge, some of them still exist)
The first Ursulines, also, founded by St
Angela Merici (1540), belonged to the Third Order.
The history of the Third Order of St
Francis had a range of organizational models
Some monasteries were established to pursue the purely contemplative life, usually in an urban setting; others communities of women did not embrace the enclosure, but considered active works of charity, tending to the poor and sick, as part of their Franciscan charism
In the nineteenth century many of the new congregations adopted the Rule of the Third Order, but most of them have no connection with the First Order
As to their activities, almost all dedicate themselves to works of charity, either in hospitals, homes, or ateliers; others work in schools, not a few are in foreign missions.
