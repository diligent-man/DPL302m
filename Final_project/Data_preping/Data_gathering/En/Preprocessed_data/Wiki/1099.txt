The Third Order of Saint Francis is a third order in the Franciscan tradition of Christianity founded by the medieval Italian Catholic friar Francis of Assisi
The preaching of Francis and his disciples caused many married men and women to want to join the Franciscan First Order as friar or the Second Order as a nun This being incompatible with their state of life Francis found a middle way in he gave them a rule animated by the Franciscan spirit Those following this rule became members of the Franciscan Third Order sometimes called tertiaries
The Third Order is divided into Third Order Regulars who live in religious congregations and Third Order Seculars or the Secular Franciscan Order who live in fraternities The latter do not wear a religious habit take vows or live in community but gather together in community on a regular basis In the Catholic Third Order of Saint Francis was reorganised and given a new Rule of Life by Pope Paul VI
Apart from the Third Order of Saint Francis in Catholicism the Lutheran and Anglican traditions also have Franciscan third orders
Tertiaries from the Latin tertiarius relative to third or what are known as Third Orders are those who live according to the Third Rule of religious orders either inside or outside of a religious community The idea which forms the basis of this institute is to allow those who cannot enter a religious order to enjoy the advantages and privileges of religious orders
When the immediate disciples of the saint had become an order bound by the religious vows it became necessary to provide for the great body of laity married men and women who could not leave the world or abandon their avocations but still were part of the Franciscan movement and desired to carry out in their lives its spirit and teaching And so probably in Francis drew up a Rule for those of his followers who were debarred from being members of the order of Friars Minor At first they were called Brothers and Sisters of the Order of Penance but later on when the Friars were called the First Order and the nuns the Second Order the Order of Penance became the Third Order of St Francis whence the name Tertiaries According to the traditions of the Order the original Rule was given by St Francis in to a married couple Luchesius Modestini and his wife Buonadonna who wished to follow him but did not feel called to separate as a married couple
Francis was assisted by his friend Cardinal Ugolino later Pope Gregory IX in the creation of the order Immediately on its establishment in the Third Order spread rapidly all over Italy and throughout western Europe and embraced multitudes of men and women of all ranks from highest to lowest Everywhere it was connected closely with the First Order
Because of the prohibition of bearing arms the followers of this order came into conflict with local authorities and the feudal system of Italy which customarily required men to carry arms for service in militias or for their lords By the th century local Third Order Confraternities with variations had been established In Pope Nicholas IV confirmed the religious order in the bull Supra montem and put the Third Order under the care of the Friars Minor
The Third Order was created by Francis of Assisi and was the exemplar after which the others were fashioned but at an early date the other Mendicant Orders formed Third Orders on the same lines and so there came into being Dominican Tertiaries and Carmelite and Augustinian and Servite and also Premonstratensian and many others These followed the same lines of development as the Franciscan Tertiaries and for the most part divided into the two branches of regular and secular Tertiaries The Rules of the various Third Orders have proved very adaptable to the needs of modern congregations devoted to active works of charity and so a great number of teaching and nursing congregations of women belong to one or other of the Third Orders
By the th century numerous individuals living under the Rule of the Third Order were living in small communities and leading eremitical lives A papal decree of organized the more isolated communities into a new and separate religious order with its own rule of life The Third Order became defined between the Third Order Regular TOR i e living under a Regula or Rule and the Third Order Secular for those members of the Order who lived in the world
The Franciscan Third Order was always the principal one and it received a great impetus and a renewed vogue from Pope Leo XIII in in his approval of a new Rule for the seculars In Paul Sabatier published a Rule of Life of the Brothers and Sisters of Penance which probably contained with additions the substance of the original Rule of It prescribed severe simplicity of dress and of life and certain abstinences and prayers and other religious exercises and forbade the frequentation of the theatre the bearing of arms and the taking of oaths except when administered by magistrates
In the nineteenth century many new congregations adopted the Rule of the Third Order without connection with the First Order In Pope Paul VI caused the separate Rules for both regulars and seculars to be recast and made more suitable for the requirements of devout men and women at the present day The secular wing of the Order was renamed as the Secular Franciscan Order
After the Reformation Franciscan third orders aligned with the Lutheran Churches and Anglican Communion were organized such as the Evangelical Franciscans Tertiaries Evangelischen Franziskaner Tertiaren which was founded in by Friedrich Heiler a Lutheran priest in Germany
The Secular Franciscan Order Ordo Franciscanus Saecularis in Latin formerly the Third Order Secular allows both laypeople and diocesan priests to join A number of Popes have also been members of this Order Members of the Secular Franciscan Order are not required to live in religious community but meet in community regularly Professed members use the letters OFS after their name Presently there are about members worldwide
The current rule was given by Pope Paul VI in with the ecclesiastical letter Seraphicus Patriarcha to adapt the Secular Franciscan Order to th century needs Under the new Rule the tertiaries of the Franciscan movement were set up as an autonomous Order with their own Minister General as head and became a fully recognized order within the Catholic church The order's name was changed from the Third Order Secular to the Secular Franciscan Order
The origin of the Regular Third Order can be traced back to the second half of the thirteenth century It was organized in different forms in the Netherlands the south of France Germany and Italy Probably some secular tertiaries who in many cases had their house of meeting gradually withdrew entirely from the world and formed religious communities but without the three substantial vows of religious orders Other religious associations such as the Beguines women and Beghards men in the Low Countries sometimes became Third Orders
Throughout the fourteenth century the regular tertiaries of both sexes had in the most cases no common organization only in the following century did single well ordered religious communities with solemn vows and a common head develop Pope Martin V submitted in all tertiaries regular and secular to the direction of the Minister General of the Friars Minor but this disposition was soon revoked by his successor Pope Eugene IV Leo X to introduce uniformity into the numerous congregations gave a new form to the rule in It retained the rule as published by Nicholas IV all that could serve the purpose but added new points such as the three solemn vows and insisting on subjection to the First Order of St Francis For this last disposition the Rule of Leo X was met with resistance and never was accepted by some congregations
More than congregations profess the Rule and Life of the Brothers and Sisters of the Third Order Regular of St Francis There are male congregations of Tertiary Franciscans congregations of Franciscan Sisters and monasteries of cloistered nuns The Third Order congregations of men and women number over
A new Rule written by friars and sisters of various congregations was approved by Pope Paul VI in It is the current Rule followed by all congregations of the Third Order Regular
It was not until the th century that there developed single well ordered religious communities with solemn vows and a common head In the th century there were numerous independent male congregations of regular tertiaries with the three vows in Italy Sicily Dalmatia Spain Portugal France Germany and in the Netherlands

In Bishop John Loughlin issued an invitation to the Brothers of the monastery to operate schools for the boys of the Diocese of Brooklyn
There were also congregations of religious sisters of the Third Order for instance the Grey Sisters of the Third Order serving in hospitals spread in France and the Netherlands In Elizabeth of Reute and several other young women who were Franciscan tertiaries under the guidance of Dom Konrad K gelin provost of the Canonry of St Peter in Waldsee acquired a house in Reute on the outskirts of Waldsee This community was a proto monastery of the Order as tertiaries of the mendicant orders had not yet been allowed to profess vows
Angelina of Marsciano is generally credited with the founding of the Third Order Regular for women around as her religious congregation marked the establishment of the first Franciscan community of women living under the Rule of the Third Order Regular authorized by Pope Nicholas V Unlike the Second Order of the Franciscan movement the Poor Clare nuns they were not an enclosed religious order and lived under the authority of the local bishop of the diocese
Whilst Leo X in the reform of the rule had left it free to the congregations to adopt papal enclosure or not Pius V prescribed it to all convents of tertiary sisters with solemn vows Still this order was not carried out everywhere In this regard the custom prevailed that the Friars Minor refused to take the direction of those convents which had only episcopal enclosure Besides those already mentioned above we may add the different offshoots of the Sisters of St Elizabeth in Austria Germany the Netherlands and France there under the name of Soeurs du Refuge some of them still exist The first Ursulines also founded by St Angela Merici belonged to the Third Order
The history of the Third Order of St Francis had a range of organizational models Some monasteries were established to pursue the purely contemplative life usually in an urban setting others communities of women did not embrace the enclosure but considered active works of charity tending to the poor and sick as part of their Franciscan charism In the nineteenth century many of the new congregations adopted the Rule of the Third Order but most of them have no connection with the First Order As to their activities almost all dedicate themselves to works of charity either in hospitals homes or ateliers others work in schools not a few are in foreign missions
