labrador can be divided into four geographical regions the north coast central labrador western labrador and the south coast
each of those regions is described below
from cape chidley to hamilton inlet the long thin northern tip of labrador holds the torngat mountains named after an inuit spirit believed to inhabit them
the mountains stretch along the coast from port manvers to cape chidley the northernmost point of labrador
the torngat mountain range is also home to mount caubvick the highest point in the province
this area is predominantly inuit with the exception of a small innu community natuashish
the north coast is the most isolated region of labrador with snowmobiles boats and planes being the only modern modes of transportation
the largest community in this region is nain
nunatsiavut is an inuit self government region in labrador created on june
the settlement area comprises the majority of labrador s north coast while the land use area also includes land farther to the interior and in central labrador
nain is the administrative centre
central labrador extends from the shores of lake melville into the interior
it contains the churchill river the largest river in labrador and one of the largest in canada
the hydroelectric dam at churchill falls is the second largest underground power station in the world
most of the supply is bought by hydro qu bec under a long term contract
the lower churchill project will develop the remaining potential of the river and supply it to provincial consumers
known as the heart of the big land the area s population comprises people from all groups and regions of labrador
central labrador is also home to happy valley goose bay
once a refuelling point for plane convoys to europe during world war ii cfb goose bay is now operated as a nato tactical flight training site
it was an alternate landing zone for the united states space shuttle
other major communities in the area are north west river and the large innu reserve known as sheshatshiu
the highlands above the churchill falls were once an ancient hunting ground for the innu first nations and settled trappers of labrador
after the construction of the hydroelectric dam at churchill falls in the smallwood reservoir has flooded much of the old hunting land submerging several grave sites and trapping cabins in the process
western labrador is also home to the iron ore company of canada which operates a large iron ore mine in labrador city
together with the small community of wabush the two towns are known as labrador west
from hamilton inlet to cape st
charles st
lewis nunatukavut is the territory of the nunatukavummiut or central southern labrador inuit formerly known as the labrador m tis
it includes portions of central and western labrador but more nunatukavummiut reside in its south coast portion it is peppered with tiny inuit fishing communities of which cartwright is the largest
from cape charles to the quebec labrador coastal border the straits is known for its labrador sea grass as is nunatukavut and the multitude of icebergs that pass by the coast via the labrador current
red bay is known as one of the best examples of a preserved th century basque whaling station

most of labrador from cartwright north and west uses atlantic time utc in winter utc in summer
the south eastern tip nearest newfoundland uses newfoundland time utc in winter utc in summer to stay co ordinated with the more populous part of the province
most of labrador has a subarctic climate dfc but northern labrador has a tundra climate et and happy valley goose bay has a humid continental dfb microclimate
summers are typically cool to mild across labrador and very rainy and usually last from late june to the end of august
autumn is generally short lasting only a couple of weeks and is typically cool and cloudy
winters are long cold and extremely snowy due to the icelandic low
springtime most years does not arrive until late april with the last snow fall usually falling during early june
labrador is a very cloudy place with sunshine levels staying relatively low during spring and summer due to the amount of rain and clouds before sharply dropping off during september as winter draws nearer
early settlement in labrador was tied to the sea as demonstrated by the montagnais or innu and inuit although these peoples also made significant forays throughout the interior
it is believed that the norsemen were the first europeans to sight labrador around ad
the area was known as markland in greenlandic norse and its inhabitants were known as the skr ling
in and the portuguese explorers jo o fernandes lavrador and pro de barcelos reached what was probably now labrador which is believed to be the origin of its name
maggiolo s world map shows a solid eurasian continent running from scandinavia around the north pole including asia s arctic coast to newfoundland labrador and greenland
on the extreme northeast promontory of north america maggiolo place names include terra de los ingres land of the english and terra de lavorador de rey de portugall land of lavrador of the king of portugal
further south we notice terra de corte real e de rey de portugall land of corte real and of the king of portugal and terra de pescaria land for fishing
in the wolfenb ttel map believed to be the work of diogo ribeiro along the coast of greenland the following legend was added as he who first sighted it was a farmer from the azores islands this name remains attached to that country
this is believed to be jo o fernandes
for the first seven decades or so of the sixteenth century the name labrador was sometimes also applied to what we know as greenland
labrador lavrador in portuguese means husbandman or farmer of a tract of land from labor in latin the land of the labourer
european settlement was largely concentrated in coastal communities particularly those south of st
lewis and cape charles and are among canada s oldest european settlements
in basque mariners came ashore at a natural harbour on the northeast coast of the strait of belle isle
they gave this new land its latin name terranova
a whaling station was set up around the bay which they called butus and is now named red bay after the red terracotta roof tiles they brought with them
a whaling ship the san juan sank there in and was raised in
the moravian brethren of herrnhut saxony first came to the labrador coast in to minister to the migratory inuit tribes there
they founded nain okak hebron hopedale and makkovik
quite poor both european and first nations settlements along coastal labrador came to benefit from cargo and relief vessels that were operated as part of the grenfell mission see wilfred grenfell
throughout the th century coastal freighters and ferries operated initially by the newfoundland railway and later canadian national railway cn marine marine atlantic became a critical lifeline for communities on the coast which for the majority of that century did not have any road connection with the rest of north america
labrador was within new france mostly by
however the treaty of paris that ended the french and indian war transferred new france including labrador though excluding the islands of saint pierre and miquelon southwest of newfoundland to the british which administered the area as the province of quebec until splitting it in two in with labrador located in lower canada
however in the british imperial government detached labrador from lower canada for transfer to the separate self governing newfoundland colony
as part of newfoundland since labrador was still being disputed by quebec until the british resolved their border in
in newfoundland entered into confederation becoming part of canada see above articles for full information
labrador played strategic roles during both world war ii and the cold war
in october a german u boat crew installed an automated weather station on the northern tip of labrador near cape chidley code named weather station kurt the installation of the equipment was the only known armed german military operation on the north american mainland during the war
the station broadcast weather observations to the german navy for only a few days but was not discovered until when a historian working with the canadian coast guard identified its location and mounted an expedition to recover it
the station is now exhibited in the canadian war museum
the canadian government built a major air force base at goose bay at the head of lake melville during the second world war a site selected because of its topography access to the sea defensible location and minimal fog
during the second world war and the cold war the base was also home to american british and later german dutch and italian detachments
today serco the company contracted to operate cfb goose bay is one of the largest employers for the community of happy valley goose bay
additionally both the royal canadian air force and united states air force built and operated a number of radar stations along coastal labrador as part of the pinetree line mid canada line and dew line systems
today the remaining stations are automated as part of the north warning system however the military settlements during the early part of the cold war surrounding these stations have largely continued as local innu and inuit populations have clustered near their port and airfield facilities
during the first half of the th century some of the largest iron ore deposits in the world were discovered in the western part of labrador and adjacent areas of quebec
deposits at mont wright schefferville labrador city and wabush drove industrial development and human settlement in the area during the second half of the th century
the present community of labrador west is entirely a result of the iron ore mining activities in the region
the iron ore company of canada operates the quebec north shore and labrador railway to transport ore concentrate km mi south to the port of sept les quebec for shipment to steel mills in north america and elsewhere
during the s the churchill river labrador name grand river was diverted at churchill falls resulting in the flooding of an enormous area today named the smallwood reservoir after joey smallwood the first premier of newfoundland
the flooding of the reservoir destroyed large areas of habitat for the threatened woodland caribou
a hydroelectric generating station was built in labrador and a transmission line to the neighbouring province of quebec
construction of a large hydroelectric dam project at muskrat falls began in by nalcor energy and the province of newfoundland
muskrat falls is km miles west of happy valley goose bay on the grand river newfoundland name churchill river
a transmission line began construction in october and was completed in that will deliver power down to the southern tip of labrador and underwater across the strait of belle isle to the province of newfoundland in
from the s to early s the trans labrador highway was built in stages to connect various inland communities with the north american highway network at mont wright quebec which in turn is connected by a highway running north from baie comeau quebec
a southern extension of this highway has opened in stages during the early s and is resulting in significant changes to the coastal ferry system in the strait of belle isle and southeastern labrador
these highways are so called only because of their importance to the region they would be better described as roads and are not completely paved
a study on a fixed link to newfoundland in recommended that a tunnel under the strait of belle isle being a single railway that would carry cars buses and trucks was technologically the best option for such a link
however the study also concluded that a fixed link was not economically viable
conceivably if built with federal aid the terms of union would be amended to remove ferry service from nova scotia to port aux basques across the cabot strait
although a highway link has as of december been completed across labrador this route is somewhat longer than a proposed quebec north shore highway that presently does not exist
part of the highway route starting approximately kilometres mi from baie comeau to kilometres mi is of an inferior alignment and from there to kilometres mi the provincial border is an accident prone section notorious for its poor surface and sharp curves
quebec in april announced major upgrades to route to be carried out
route and the trans labrador highway were added to canada s national highway system in september
labrador constitutes a federal electoral district electing one member to the house of commons of canada
due to its size distinct nature and large aboriginal population labrador has one seat despite having the smallest population of any electoral district in canada
formerly labrador was part of a riding that included part of the island of newfoundland
labrador is divided into four provincial electoral districts in the newfoundland and labrador house of assembly
in labrador had been transferred from lower canada to the newfoundland colony but the inland boundary of labrador had never been precisely stated
newfoundland argued it extended to the height of land while canada stressing the historical use of the term coasts of labrador argued the boundary was statute mile km inland from the high tide mark
as canada and newfoundland were separate dominions but both within the british empire the matter was referred to the judicial committee of the privy council in london
their decision set the labrador boundary mostly along the coastal watershed with part being defined by the nd parallel north
one of newfoundland s conditions for joining confederation in was that this boundary be entrenched in the canadian constitution
while this border has not been formally accepted by the quebec government the henri dorion commission commission d tude sur l int grit du territoire du qu bec concluded in the early s that quebec no longer has a legal claim to labrador
in parti qu b cois cabinet ministers jacques brassard and joseph facal reasserted that qu bec has never recognised the border
a royal commission in determined that there is some public pressure from labradorians to break from newfoundland and become a separate province or territory
some of the innu nation would have the area become a homeland for them much as nunavut is for the inuit as a good portion of nitassinan falls within labrador s borders a resolution of the assembly of first nations claimed labrador as a homeland for the innu and demanded recognition in any further constitutional negotiations regarding the region
labrador s innu became status indians under the indian act in
natuashish became a federal indian reserve in
sheshatshiu became a federal reserve in
the labrador inuit association had filed a land claim for portions of labradorian land in
in the labrador inuit association the government of the province of newfoundland and the government of canada began negotiations based on the land claim
an agreement in principle was achieved in and on may the agreement was ratified by over of eligible voters subject to the land claim
on january the inuit of nunatsiavut signed the labrador inuit lands claims agreement with the federal and provincial governments covering km sq mi of land including the entire northern salient of labrador north of nain as well as a portion of the atlantic coast south of there
the agreement also includes km sq mi of sea rights
although the inuit will not own the whole area they were granted special rights related to traditional land use and they will own km sq mi designated labrador inuit lands
the agreement also establishes the torngat mountains national park in the northern area of the land claim
the agreement was ratified by the labrador inuit the general assembly of newfoundland and labrador and the parliament of canada where it received royal assent on june
in the late s the labrador metis association was created by the inhabitants of labrador s southern coast to gain recognition as a distinct ethnocultural group as at the time despite a pre existing treaty protected under the constitution the inuit metis were considered to be merely the descendants of inuit who had joined western society
little was known about the history of the inuit metis of the time
in the labrador metis association initiated a project with memorial university of newfoundland to better understand their past through the community university research association cura
following research by cura the labrador metis were understood to be a continuation of the inuit people of southern labrador
in the labrador metis association changed its name to reflect their newly discovered heritage and became the nunatukavut community council
the southern inuit of nunatukavut who are also seeking self government have their land claim before the government of canada
the government of newfoundland and labrador refuses to recognise or negotiate with the inuit of nunatukavut until their claim has been accepted by the government of canada
cd cd refer to census divisions
according to the census labrador was white inuit metis and first nations innu
labrador is home to a number of flora and fauna species
most of the upper canadian and lower hudsonian mammalian species are found in labrador
notably the polar bear ursus maritimus reaches the southeast of labrador on its seasonal movements
