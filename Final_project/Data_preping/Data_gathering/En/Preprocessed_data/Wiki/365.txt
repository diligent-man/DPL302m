Cathedral High School is a private, college preparatory Catholic all-boys school in Los Angeles, California.
Cathedral High School was founded by Archbishop John Joseph Cantwell as the first Los Angeles Archdiocesan high school for boys in Fall 1925
The school was built on the site of old Calvary Cemetery, where leading families of Los Angeles were buried until relocated at the turn of the 20th century
 It is just northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
Cathedral was the first high school for boys established by the Archdiocese
The Christian Brothers have administered the school since its founding and In 1996, a historic agreement was reached with the Archdiocese allowing the school to operate as a private Lasallian institution
Cathedral's location allows for a view of the Los Angeles skyline and the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and adjacent to Dodger Stadium in Chávez Ravine and Chinatown, Los Angeles, California.The school was designated Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument number 281 in 1984.
The school athletics teams are nicknamed the Phantoms because of its location on the old cemetery.
Plans were announced in 2003 for a new building to house classrooms and the gym
The building was funded mainly by donations
Construction began in 2005 with the demolition of the old, sixty-five-year-old gym and was complete in 2007
The new building houses items from the previous building, including the old scoreboard and wood floor.
