After the Greek War of Independence ended in a new southern Greek state was established with assistance from the British Empire Kingdom of France and Imperial Russia However this new Greek state under John Capodistria after the Greek War of Independence was with Serbia one of the only two countries of the era whose population was smaller than the population of the same ethnicity outside its borders most ethnic Greeks still resided within the borders of the Ottoman Empire This version of Greece was designed by the Great Powers who had no desire to see a larger Greek state replace the Ottoman Empire

The Ottoman Empire in reaction to the rebellion of Crete and the assistance sent by Greece relocated a significant part of its army in the Balkans to the north of Thessaly close to the borders with Greece Greece in reply reinforced its borders in Thessaly However irregular Greek forces and followers of the Megali Idea acted without orders and raided Turkish outposts leading the Ottoman Empire to declare war on Greece the war is known as the Greco Turkish War of The Turkish army far outnumbering the Greek was also better prepared due to the recent reforms carried out by a German mission under Baron von der Goltz The Greek army fell back in retreat The other Great Powers then intervened and an armistice was signed in May The war however only ended in December of that year
