the megali idea greek romanized meg li id a lit great idea is an irredentist concept that expresses the goal of reviving the byzantine empire by establishing a greek state which would include the large greek populations that were still under ottoman rule after the end of the greek war of independence and all the regions that had large greek populations parts of the southern balkans asia minor and cyprus
the term appeared for the first time during the debates of prime minister ioannis kolettis with king otto that preceded the promulgation of the constitution
it came to dominate foreign relations and played a significant role in domestic politics for much of the first century of greek independence
the expression was new in but the concept had roots in the greek popular psyche which long had hopes of liberation from ottoman rule and restoration of the byzantine empire
once more as years and time go by once more they shall be ours the megali idea implies the goal of reviving the eastern roman byzantine empire by establishing a greek state which would be as ancient geographer strabo wrote a greek world encompassing mostly the former byzantine lands from the ionian sea to the west to asia minor and the black sea to the east and from thrace macedonia and epirus to the north to crete and cyprus to the south
this new state would have constantinople as its capital it would be the greece of two continents and five seas europe and asia the ionian aegean marmara black and libyan seas respectively
if realized this would expand modern greece to roughly the same size and extent of the later byzantine empire after its restoration in ad
the megali idea dominated foreign policy and domestic politics of greece from the war of independence in the s through the balkan wars in the beginning of the th century
it started to fade after the greco turkish war and the great fire of smyrna in followed by the population exchange between greece and turkey in
despite the end of the megali idea project in by then the greek state had expanded four times either through military conquest or diplomacy often with british support
after the creation of greece in it annexed the ionian islands treaty of london thessaly convention of constantinople macedonia crete southern epirus and the eastern aegean islands treaty of bucharest and western thrace treaty of neuilly
the dodecanese were annexed after the second world war treaty of peace with italy
a related concept is enosis
the byzantine empire was eastern roman in origin and was called the roman empire by its inhabitants though often not by the latin west which regarded it as greek
after its fall hieronymus wolf popularized the usage of byzantium
it became hellenistic with time to the point where greek replaced latin as the official language in ad owing to several factors its religion being christian with the new testament written in greek its location in the greek speaking realm and sphere of influence and the fact that following the fall of the western roman empire it became the eastern continuation of the roman empire
byzantium held out against the invasions of the centuries with a vitality that the western roman empire lost repelling the visigoths the huns the saracens the mongols and finally the turks during the first siege
constantinople the capital of byzantium fell to the fourth crusaders in the early years of the th century
the city was eventually liberated by the empire of nicaea a byzantine successor and the empire survived
however the weakened city fell to a different power in the ottoman turks and this fall of constantinople marked the end of byzantine civilization after the defeat the city was comprehensively handed over to turks
latin merchants like the genoese colony of galata and even the patriarch of constantinople recognized their rule
following the conquest of constantinople there were no official byzantine territories left but everything became part of the ottoman empire
under the millet system which was in force during the ottoman empire the population was classified according to religion rather than language or ethnicity
orthodox greeks were seen as part of the millet i r m literally roman community which included all orthodox christians including beside greeks also bulgarians serbs vlachs slavs georgians romanians and albanians despite their differences in ethnicity and language and despite the fact that the religious hierarchy was greek dominated
it is not clear to what extent one can speak of a greek identity during those times as opposed to a christian or orthodox identity
in the late s catherine ii of russia and joseph ii of austria intended to reclaim the byzantine heritage and restore the greek statehood as part of their joint greek plan
during the middle ages and the ottoman period greek speaking christians identified as romans and thought of themselves as the descendants of the roman empire including the medieval eastern roman empire
the term roman was often interpreted as synonymous with christian throughout europe and the mediterranean during this time
the terms greek or hellene were largely seen by ottoman christians as referring to the ancient pagan peoples of the region
this changed during the late stages of the ottoman empire and the emergence of the greek independence movement
after the greek war of independence ended in a new southern greek state was established with assistance from the british empire kingdom of france and imperial russia
however this new greek state under john capodistria after the greek war of independence was with serbia one of the only two countries of the era whose population was smaller than the population of the same ethnicity outside its borders most ethnic greeks still resided within the borders of the ottoman empire
this version of greece was designed by the great powers who had no desire to see a larger greek state replace the ottoman empire
the great idea embodied a desire to bring all ethnic greeks into the greek state and subsequently revive the byzantine empire it applied specifically to the greeks in epirus thessaly macedonia thrace the aegean islands crete cyprus parts of anatolia and the city of constantinople which would replace athens as the capital
when the young danish prince wilhelm georg was elected king in the title offered to him by the greek national assembly was not king of greece the title of his deposed predecessor king otto but rather king of the hellenes
implicit in the wording was that george i was to be king of all greeks regardless of whether they then lived within the borders of his new kingdom
the first additional areas to be incorporated into the kingdom were the ionian islands in and later thessaly with the treaty of berlin
in january violence and disorder were escalating in crete polarizing the population
massacres of the christian population took place in chania and rethimno
the greek government pressured by public opinion intransigent political elements extreme nationalist groups e g
ethniki etairia and with the great powers reluctant to intervene decided to send warships and personnel to assist the cretans
the great powers had no option then but to proceed with the occupation of the island but they were too late
a greek force of men had landed at kolymbari on february and its commanding officer colonel timoleon vassos declared that he was taking over the island in the name of the king of the hellenes and that he was announcing the union of crete with greece
this led to an uprising that spread immediately throughout the island
the great powers finally decided to land their troops and stopped the greek army force from approaching chania
at the same time their fleets blockaded crete preventing both greeks and turks from bringing any more troops to the island
the ottoman empire in reaction to the rebellion of crete and the assistance sent by greece relocated a significant part of its army in the balkans to the north of thessaly close to the borders with greece
greece in reply reinforced its borders in thessaly
however irregular greek forces and followers of the megali idea acted without orders and raided turkish outposts leading the ottoman empire to declare war on greece the war is known as the greco turkish war of
the turkish army far outnumbering the greek was also better prepared due to the recent reforms carried out by a german mission under baron von der goltz
the greek army fell back in retreat
the other great powers then intervened and an armistice was signed in may
the war however only ended in december of that year
the military failure in the greco turkish war cost greece small territorial losses along the border line in northern thessaly and a large sum of financial reparations that wrecked greece s economy for years while giving no lasting solution to the cretan question
the great powers britain france russia and italy in order to prevent future clashes and trying to avoid the creation of a revanchist climate in greece imposed what they thought of as the final solution on the cretan question crete was proclaimed an autonomous cretan state
the four great powers assumed the administration of crete and in a decisive diplomatic victory for greece prince george of greece second son of king george i became high commissioner
a major proponent of the megali idea was eleftherios venizelos under whose leadership greek territory doubled in the balkan wars of southern epirus crete lesbos chios ikaria samos samothrace lemnos and the majority of macedonia were attached to greece
born and raised in crete in venizelos was already a prominent cretan and had influence in mainland greece
as such he was invited after the goudi coup in by the military league to become prime minister of greece
venizelos pressed forward a series of reforms in society as well as the military and administration which helped greece succeed in its goals during the balkan wars
following the greek gains in the balkan wars the ottomans began to persecute ethnic greeks living in the empire which led to ethnic cleansing in the greek genocide
this persecution continued into world war i when the ottomans declared for the central powers on late
greece remained neutral until when they joined the allies
refugees reports of turkish atrocities as well as the allied victory in world war i seemed to promise an even greater realization of the megali idea
greece gained a foothold in asia minor with a protectorate over smyrna and its hinterland
following years of greek administration a referendum was to be held to determine whether the territory would revert to ottoman control or join greece
greece also gained the islands of imbros and tenedos western and eastern thrace the border then drawn a few miles from the walls of constantinople
greece s efforts to take control of smyrna in accordance with the treaty of s vres were thwarted by turkish revolutionaries who were resisting the allies
the turks finally prevailed and expelled the greeks from anatolia during the greco turkish war part of the turkish war of independence
the war was concluded by the treaty of lausanne which saw greece lose eastern thrace imbros and tenedos smyrna and the possibility of staying in anatolia
to avoid any further territorial claims both greece and turkey engaged in an exchange of populations during the conflict greeks had already fled asia minor
the treaty of lausanne moved greeks from turkey while turks left the greek territory for turkey
this followed other so called population exchanges after world war i including greeks from bulgaria from russia because of the defeat of the white army led by pyotr wrangel and from other lands for example dodecanese or albania while bulgarians from thrace and macedonia had moved to bulgaria
from the bulgarian refugees ca
were from greek macedonia
the immediate reception of refugees to greece cost million francs so the league of nations arranged for a loan of million francs to aid settlement of refugees
in venizelos even went on an official visit to turkey where he proposed that mustafa kemal be awarded the nobel peace prize
the greek novelist yiorgos theotokas described the psychological impact of the defeat of for a short time while the treaty of serves ran its joyful but uncertain course it seemed to them that the long buried hopes of their ancestors were to be fulfilled
but the terrible summer of came all too soon
from the hermitage of arsenios they watched tense with anxiety the daily unfolding of the national tragedy the last desperate efforts of the royalist governments of greece to save the situation the failure of king constantine s attempt to take constantinople and the final catastrophe in mid august mustapha kemal broke through the greek front and the greek army exhausted by ten years of warfare and the privations of the asia minor campaign was vanquished in two weeks
the turks advancing rapidly recaptured in quick succession afion karahisar eski shehir kiutahia brussa oushak and then smyrna once again the banners of islam floated proudly tauntingly over the aegean coast opposite chios and mytilene
the whole of ionia was in flames
slaughter and pillage descended on the smiling city of smyrna and in a few short days turned it into a ruin as day succeeded day greece seemed to have become paralyzed to have lost all will all ability to resist the blows of fate
the swiftness of the catastrophe completely overwhelmed the state flooded as it was by the thousands of fleeting soldiers and refugees who sought shelter on the greek coasts the nation was plunged into deep despair greece had lost her big gamble and had been uprooted from asia minor
sophia remained in the hands of the moslems
the brilliant plans of were mocking visions hallucinations dreams
and the return of reality was truly heartbreaking
the tale of the years was not yet told then the historic hour the fulfillment of the great idea the moment they had longed for with such faith and such anxiety for five tortured bloody centuries had not yet come it was all a lie although the great idea ceased to be a driving force behind greek foreign policy some remnants continued to influence greek foreign policy throughout the remainder of the th century
thus after his coup d tat of august ioannis metaxas proclaimed the advent of the third hellenic civilization similar to adolf hitler s third reich influenced by pan germanism
the attack by italy from albania and the greek victories enabled greece to conquer during the winter of parts of southern albania northern epirus as it is identified by greeks which were administered as a province of greece for a short time until the german offensive of april
the occupation resistance and the civil war initially put the great idea in the background
nevertheless another very good diplomatic performance by the greek side at the paris peace conference secured a further enlargement of greek territory in the form of the dodecanese islands despite the very strong opposition of vyacheslav molotov and the soviet delegates
the greek civil war such as the soviet opposition was also the main reason for the non incorporation of the northern epirus since albania was after wwii communist controlled
the british colony of cyprus became the apple of discord between the two countries putting an end to the positive greco turkish relations that had existed since the kemal venizelos agreement in the s
in a greek army colonel of greek cypriot origin george grivas began a campaign of civil disobedience whose purpose was primarily to drive the british from the island then move for enosis with greece
the greek prime minister alexandros papagos was not unfavourable to this idea
there was increasing polarisation of opinion between the dominant greek population and the minority turks
the problems in cyprus affected the continent itself
in september in response to the demand for nosis an anti greek riot took place in istanbul
during the istanbul pogrom stores hotels and restaurants and churches were destroyed or damaged
this led to the last great wave of migration from turkey to greece
the z rich agreement of culminated in independence of the island with greece turkey and uk as guarantee powers
the inter ethnic clashes from led to the dispatch of a peacekeeping force of the united nations in
the cyprus issue was revived by the dictatorship of the colonels who presented their april coup d tat as the only way to defend the traditional values of what they called the hellenic christian civilization
brigadier general ioannidis arranged in july to overthrow cypriot president archbishop makarios and proceed with enosis union with greece
this led to turkey invading the island in response with the expulsion of greek cypriots in areas controlled by turkey and the flight of turkish cypriots from the south
in the north declared independence but to this day the only country that recognizes northern cyprus is turkey
the ultra nationalist golden dawn party which had electoral support from to supports the megali idea with party leader nikolaos michaloliakos stating
michaloliakos criticized thessaloniki mayor yiannis boutaris for wanting to name a street after atat rk who was born in the city when it was still part of the ottoman empire
in january a group of golden dawn supporters attacked the car of turkish consul general osman i lhan ener and hurled insults at atat rk during an anti turkey protest in komotini
mihaloliakos has also called for the liberation of northern epirus
golden dawn and its former cypriot counterpart elam support enosis
in close to golden dawn members and leaders were arrested on a range of charges including murder and racketeering
in the party s level of support slumped to less than
in october most of golden dawn s leadership was convicted including michaloliakos
