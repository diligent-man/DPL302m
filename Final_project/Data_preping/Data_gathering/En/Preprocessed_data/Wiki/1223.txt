video scaler system convert video signal one display resolution another typically scaler used convert signal lower resolution p standard definition higher resolution high definition process known upconversion upscaling contrast converting high low resolution known downconversion downscaling
video scaler typically found inside consumer electronics device television video game console dvd blu-ray player also found av equipment video editing television broadcasting equipment
video scaler also completely separate device often providing simple video switching capabilities
unit commonly found part home theatre projected presentation systems
often combined video processing device algorithm create video processor improves apparent definition video signals
video scaler primarily digital device however combined analog-to-digital converter adc digitizer digital-to-analog converter dac support analog input outputs
native resolution display many physical pixel make row column visible area display's output surface
many different video signal use resolution neither display thus form resolution adaptation required properly frame video signal display device
example within united state ntsc atsc vesa video standard several different resolution video formats
multiple common resolution also used high-definition television p p
scaling video signal doe allow match size particular display process result increased number visual artifact signal ringing posterization

cable network tnt introduced hd feed controversially employed stretching system known flexview wa also offered broadcasters
flexview used nonlinear method stretch near edge screen center it
practice wa imposed senior vice president broadcast engineering tnt clyde d
smith argued pillarboxing led inconsistency program viewer could cause burn-in plasma television older hdtv could stretch content automatically quality stretching display wa poor
despite tnt's intention system wa frequently criticized viewer high definition channel nicknaming effect stretch-o-vision
fxx faced similar criticism use cropping scaling rerun simpson started producing episode hd beginning season cropping method caused various visual gag lost
february fxx announced response complaint would present episode original aspect ratio video-on-demand service
since network cable company run high-definition version old programing wa originally shot film shown format
example syndicated broadcast station cable network tb air seinfeld hd
