The Celtics struggled during their early years until the hiring of coach Red Auerbach In the franchise's early days Auerbach had no assistants ran all the practices did all the scouting both of opposing teams and college draft prospects and scheduled all road trips One of the first great players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy whom Auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby Holy Cross because he was too flashy Cousy's contract eventually became the property of the Chicago Stags but when that franchise went bankrupt Cousy went to the Celtics in a dispersal draft
After the season Auerbach made a stunning trade sending perennial All Star Ed Macauley to the St Louis Hawks along with the draft rights to Cliff Hagan for the second overall pick in the draft After negotiating with the Rochester Royals a negotiation that included a promise that the Celtics owner would send the highly sought after Ice Capades to Rochester if the Royals would let Russell slide to No Auerbach used the pick to select University of San Francisco center Bill Russell Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout and NBA Rookie of the Year Tom Heinsohn Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with Cousy and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the champion Celtics for more than a decade
With Bill Russell the Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the St Louis Hawks in seven games the first of a record championships Russell went on to win championships making him the most decorated player in NBA history In the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals this time losing to the Hawks in games However with the acquisition of K C Jones that year the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade In the Celtics won the NBA Championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers the first of their record eight consecutive championships
During that time the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals five times starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations In the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African American starting lineup On December Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tom Heinsohn joining Tom 'Satch' Sanders K C Jones Sam Jones and Bill Russell in the starting lineup The Celtics defeated St Louis Boston won its next games with Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn The Celtics of the late s s are widely considered one of the most dominant teams of all time
Auerbach retired as coach after the season and Russell took over as player coach which was Auerbach's ploy to keep Russell interested With his appointment Russell became the first African American coach in any U S pro sport Auerbach would remain the general manager a position he would hold well into the s However the Celtics' string of NBA titles ended when they lost to the Philadelphia ers in the Eastern Conference Finals The aging team managed two more championships in and defeating the Los Angeles Lakers each time Russell retired after the season effectively ending a Celtics dynasty that had garnered an unrivaled NBA titles in seasons The team's run of consecutive is the longest championship streak in U S professional sports history

The relationship between Brown and Auerbach worsened with Brown's decision to acquire Bob McAdoo in February in exchange for three first round draft picks that Auerbach had planned to use to rebuild the franchise Again Brown made the trade without consulting Auerbach Auerbach almost left Boston to take a job with the New York Knicks as a result With public support strongly behind Auerbach Brown sold the team to Harry Mangurian in rather than run the risk of losing his famed general manager The Celtics would struggle through the season going Newcomers Chris Ford Rick Robey Cedric Maxwell and Nate Archibald failed to reverse the team's momentum

After the season Auerbach completed one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history garnering a pair of future Hall of Famers for a pair of first round draft picks Seeking to improve the team immediately Auerbach sent the team's two first round draft picks to the Golden State Warriors for both center Robert Parish and the Warriors' first round pick He then used the pick the Celtics obtained from Golden State to select University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale The Big Three of Bird McHale and Parish played together for the Celtics until won three NBA championships together and were later described as the best NBA frontcourt of all time

One of the most recent and unexpected rivalries that has been created between the Celtics is with the Washington Wizards Although both teams had engaged in a fight in the rivalry intensified during the season in a January regular season game after Jae Crowder was given a technical foul Crowder then began to exchange words with then Wizards coach Randy Wittman It began to escalate that off season when the Celtics were trying to sign Al Horford It was publicly reported that Jae Crowder emphasized that the Celtics beat the Wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign with them rather than Washington In their first meeting of the season Wall hit Marcus Smart in the back court when they were up by late in the th quarter Wall was hit with a Flagrant foul and was promptly ejected Smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with Wall Their words continued even after being separated with Wall telling Smart to meet him out back after the game No incident was reported between the two following the game In their next meeting the Celtics won However after the game Wall and Crowder exchanged words in front of the Wizards bench Crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at Wall's nose and Wall tried to fight back with a slap Teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms Police officers had to be on guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation Otto Porter is quoted as calling the Celtics as dirty Isaiah Thomas replied If playing hard is dirty then I guess we are a dirty team
In their next game in January the Wizards wore all black to enter the game The notion was that it is similar to the attire of a funeral Their decision worked as they defeated the Celtics The two teams would go on to meet in the Conference Semifinals in the Playoffs In Game Markieff Morris landed on Horford's ankle after shooting a jumpshot Morris sprained his ankle and had to miss the rest of the game which was a loss Morris believed that Horford did this intentionally In Game Morris retaliated by grabbing Horford by the waist and pushed him into the seats In Game Kelly Olynyk set a hard screen on Kelly Oubre Olynyk's shoulder hit Oubre in the chin causing him to drop to the floor Oubre angrily rose and pushed Olynyk down onto the floor Oubre was then assessed a flagrant foul and was ejected while also being suspended for Game No significant altercations erupted in the rest of the seven game series in which the Celtics would go on to win The rivalry has since dissipated as the Celtics have retooled their roster but their match ups are still seen as significant as they played on Christmas in
