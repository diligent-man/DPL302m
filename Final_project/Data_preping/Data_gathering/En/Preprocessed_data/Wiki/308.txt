the celtics rise to dominance began in the late s after coach red auerbach acquired center bill russell who would become the cornerstone of the celtics dynasty in a draft day trade in

anchored by the big three of larry bird kevin mchale and robert parish the celtics won championships in and
the team defeated the lakers in the finals but lost to los angeles in and
after the departure of parish as a free agent and the retirement of both bird and mchale the team struggled through the s and much of the early s
it was not until the celtics assembled a new big three of kevin garnett paul pierce and ray allen that they found success once again
under the leadership of head coach doc rivers the team beat the lakers to win a championship in but lost to los angeles in a seven game series in the latest finals matchup between the two ancient rivals
by the start of the season none of the new big three were still with the team
garnett and pierce were traded away to the brooklyn nets while allen left as a free agent
after a period of rebuilding the celtics became a force again under head coach brad stevens
during the season the celtics clinched the top seed in the eastern conference but were eliminated in the conference finals
led by jaylen brown and jayson tatum the team returned to the conference finals in and and broke through to the nba finals in in head coach ime udoka s first season at the helm
the boston celtics were formed on june by boston garden arena corporation president walter a
brown as a team in the basketball association of america and became part of the national basketball association after the absorption of the national basketball league by the baa in the fall of
in the celtics signed chuck cooper becoming the first nba franchise to draft a black player
chuck connors of the rifleman fame was an original member of the celtics in
the celtics struggled during their early years until the hiring of coach red auerbach
in the franchise s early days auerbach had no assistants ran all the practices did all the scouting both of opposing teams and college draft prospects and scheduled all road trips
one of the first great players to join the celtics was bob cousy whom auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby holy cross because he was too flashy
cousy s contract eventually became the property of the chicago stags but when that franchise went bankrupt cousy went to the celtics in a dispersal draft
after the season auerbach made a stunning trade sending perennial all star ed macauley to the st
louis hawks along with the draft rights to cliff hagan for the second overall pick in the draft
after negotiating with the rochester royals a negotiation that included a promise that the celtics owner would send the highly sought after ice capades to rochester if the royals would let russell slide to no
auerbach used the pick to select university of san francisco center bill russell
auerbach also acquired holy cross standout and nba rookie of the year tom heinsohn
russell and heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with cousy and they were the players around whom auerbach would build the champion celtics for more than a decade
with bill russell the celtics advanced to the nba finals and defeated the st
louis hawks in seven games the first of a record championships
russell went on to win championships making him the most decorated player in nba history
in the celtics again advanced to the nba finals this time losing to the hawks in games
however with the acquisition of k c
jones that year the celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade
in the celtics won the nba championship after sweeping the minneapolis lakers the first of their record eight consecutive championships
during that time the celtics met the lakers in the finals five times starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations
in the celtics became the first nba team to have an all african american starting lineup
on december willie naulls replaced an injured tom heinsohn joining tom satch sanders k c
jones sam jones and bill russell in the starting lineup
the celtics defeated st
louis
boston won its next games with naulls starting in place of heinsohn
the celtics of the late s s are widely considered one of the most dominant teams of all time
auerbach retired as coach after the season and russell took over as player coach which was auerbach s ploy to keep russell interested
with his appointment russell became the first african american coach in any u s
pro sport
auerbach would remain the general manager a position he would hold well into the s
however the celtics string of nba titles ended when they lost to the philadelphia ers in the eastern conference finals
the aging team managed two more championships in and defeating the los angeles lakers each time
russell retired after the season effectively ending a celtics dynasty that had garnered an unrivaled nba titles in seasons
the team s run of consecutive is the longest championship streak in u s
professional sports history
the season was a rebuilding year as the celtics had their first losing record since the season
however with the acquisition of paul silas and future hall of famers dave cowens and jo jo white the celtics soon became dominant again
after losing in the eastern conference finals in the celtics regrouped and came out determined in and posted an excellent regular season record
but the season ended in disappointment as they were upset in seven games by the new york knicks in the conference finals
john havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game seven shooting left handed
the celtics returned to the playoffs the next year defeating the milwaukee bucks in the nba finals in for their th nba championship
boston took a series lead and had a chance to claim the title on their home court
the bucks won game six in boston when kareem abdul jabbar nestled in a hook shot with seconds left in the game s second overtime and the series returned to milwaukee
cowens was the hero in game scoring points as the celtics brought the title back to boston for the first time in five years
in the team won yet another championship defeating the phoenix suns in six games
the finals featured one of the greatest games in nba history
with the series tied at two games apiece the suns trailed early in the boston garden but came back to force overtime
in double overtime a gar heard turn around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime at which point the celtics prevailed
after the championship and a playoff appearance in boston went into another rebuilding phase
in the nba draft the celtics drafted a young forward from unc charlotte named cedric maxwell
cornbread maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season but he showed promise
auerbach s job became even tougher following the season in which they went as havlicek the celtics all time leading scorer retired after seasons
the celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the nba draft
auerbach took a risk by selecting junior larry bird of indiana state with the sixth overall pick knowing that bird would stay in college for his senior year but believing that his potential would make him worth the wait
the team retained bird s rights for one year and signed him soon after he led indiana state to the ncaa championship game
in celtics owner irv levin traded franchises with buffalo braves owner john y
brown jr
two weeks before the swap of franchises was made official details of a six player trade between the two teams were reported
boston sent freeman williams kevin kunnert and kermit washington to the braves for tiny archibald billy knight and marvin barnes
the move turned boston fans against brown both because kunnert and washington were seen as key pieces of the team s future and because auerbach publicly stated that he was not consulted about the trade
the relationship between brown and auerbach worsened with brown s decision to acquire bob mcadoo in february in exchange for three first round draft picks that auerbach had planned to use to rebuild the franchise
again brown made the trade without consulting auerbach
auerbach almost left boston to take a job with the new york knicks as a result
with public support strongly behind auerbach brown sold the team to harry mangurian in rather than run the risk of losing his famed general manager
the celtics would struggle through the season going
newcomers chris ford rick robey cedric maxwell and nate archibald failed to reverse the team s momentum
larry bird debuted for the celtics during the season
with a new owner in place auerbach made a number of moves that would bring the team back to prominence
he almost immediately traded mcadoo a former nba scoring champion to the detroit pistons for guard m
carr a defensive specialist and two first round picks in the nba draft
he also picked up point guard gerald henderson from the cba
carr archibald henderson and ford formed a highly competent backcourt blending in well with the talented frontcourt of cowens maxwell and bird
with bird winning nba rookie of the year honors the team went a game improvement from the previous season
playing strong in the playoffs the celtics fell to the philadelphia ers in the eastern conference finals
after the season auerbach completed one of the most lopsided trades in nba history garnering a pair of future hall of famers for a pair of first round draft picks
seeking to improve the team immediately auerbach sent the team s two first round draft picks to the golden state warriors for both center robert parish and the warriors first round pick
he then used the pick the celtics obtained from golden state to select university of minnesota power forward kevin mchale
the big three of bird mchale and parish played together for the celtics until won three nba championships together and were later described as the best nba frontcourt of all time
despite losing center dave cowens to retirement late in training camp the celtics went under coach bill fitch in
once again the celtics faced the ers in the eastern conference finals falling behind before coming back to win game seven
the celtics went on to win the nba championship over the houston rockets with maxwell being named nba finals mvp
following the season the celtics once again met the ers in the playoffs
this time they lost in seven games

he was succeeded by jan volk
in the lakers and celtics met again in the finals with the lakers winning
this was the first time the lakers had defeated the celtics in the finals and the only time the team had won a championship at boston garden
during the following off season the celtics acquired bill walton from the los angeles clippers in exchange for cedric maxwell
walton had been an all star and league mvp while leading the portland trail blazers to the nba championship but injuries had hobbled him since
considered the best passing center in nba history he stayed healthy and was a big part of the celtics success in
the celtics won the second pick in the nba draft and drafted university of maryland star len bias one of the most heralded prospects of his era
bias died hours later of an accidental cocaine overdose
despite the tragedy the celtics remained competitive in going and again winning the eastern conference championship
they were defeated in the finals by the lakers in six games
in the celtics lost in six games to the detroit pistons in the eastern conference finals
following the season head coach k c
jones retired and was replaced by assistant jimmy rodgers
boston s hopes for faded when bird underwent a procedure to remove bone spurs in his feet early in the season and the celtics won just games before a first round playoff defeat to the pistons
bird returned in and led the celtics to a record
in the playoffs the celtics collapsed after winning the first two games in a best of five series against the new york knicks losing three straight games and the series
after the playoffs rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach and former celtics player chris ford
under ford s leadership the celtics improved to in recapturing the atlantic division title even though bird missed games with several injuries
the celtics again lost to the pistons in the playoffs
in a late season rally allowed a celtics team to catch the new york knicks and repeat as atlantic division champions
after sweeping the indiana pacers in the first round the celtics lost a seven game eastern conference semifinals series to the cleveland cavaliers
back injuries limited bird to only regular season games and just four of ten in the playoffs
after thirteen nba seasons and a gold medal at the barcelona olympics with the dream team continued back trouble led bird to retire in
the loss of bird and the aging of the team s other veteran stars forced coach chris ford into rebuilding mode
hopes centered on year old reggie lewis a small forward out of boston s northeastern university
in the first round of the playoffs lewis fainted during boston s four game series loss by the charlotte hornets
an examination revealed heart problems but lewis was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback
before he could make it he died of a heart attack while shooting baskets at brandeis university during the off season
the celtics honored his memory by retiring his number
with mchale having retired after the celtics playoff loss to the hornets boston s original big era came to an end in upon robert parish s signing with charlotte

carr fired chris ford and took the coaching reins himself
after drafting providence college star eric williams the celtics struggled to a record
things got worse in as the celtics lost a franchise record games setting an unwanted nba record winning only once against other atlantic division teams and just fifteen victories overall
in spite of the emergence of st round draft pick antoine walker carr s resigned after the season ended while rick pitino was hired to join the franchise as the team s president director of basketball operations and head coach reportedly on a million ten year contract
volk resigned on may
pitino s appointment as team president was controversial as auerbach the incumbent who had filled that role for more than years first heard about the change from local media
unfortunately for the franchise pitino was not the savior everyone hoped he d be
auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with dignity even as the team failed to improve
the celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the nba draft and used the picks to select a brand new backcourt through chauncey billups and ron mercer
the young team that lost games the year before was dismantled with david wesley dino ra a and rick fox being let go and williams traded to the denver nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks williams would return to the celtics in and played for four years
walter mccarty was also acquired in a trade with the knicks
with a promising start upsetting the defending champions chicago bulls at home on opening night and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals the team improved its victories from to despite many losing streaks
billups was subsequently traded to the raptors during his rookie year and mercer was traded to the nuggets during his third season
the following year in the nba draft the celtics drafted paul pierce a college star who had been expected to be drafted much earlier than the celtics th overall pick
pierce had an immediate impact during the lockout shortened season averaging points and being named rookie of the month in february as he led the league in steals
however the celtics continued to struggle as pitino failed to achieve meaningful success
after boston lost to the toronto raptors on march on a buzzer beater by vince carter pitino delivered the memorable walking through that door speech invoking bird mchale and parish which has been frequently cited over the years as a reality check for organizations wrestling with bygone glory
he resigned in january
following the resignation of rick pitino the celtics saw modest improvement under coach jim o brien
paul pierce matured into an nba star and was ably complemented by antoine walker and the other players acquired over the years
while the team was when pitino left o brien s record to finish the season was
following the season o brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis
as a result of numerous trades the celtics had three picks in the nba draft
they selected joe johnson joe forte and kedrick brown
only johnson managed to succeed in the nba becoming a perennial all star after leaving the celtics
the celtics entered the season with low expectations
the team s success in the latter stages of was largely forgotten and critics were surprised when the team along with the new jersey nets surged to the top of the atlantic division ahead of the philadelphia ers who were fresh off a trip to the nba finals
the celtics won a hard fought game series with the ers in the first round
pierce scored points in the series clinching blowout at the fleet center
in the conference semifinals the celtics defeated the favored detroit pistons

irving grousbeck wycliffe grousbeck and steve pagliuca

before their elimination the team hired former celtics guard danny ainge as general manager moving chris wallace to another position in the organization
ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly sent antoine walker to the dallas mavericks along with tony delk
in return the celtics received the often injured raef lafrentz chris mills ji welsch and a first round pick in
the celtics made the playoffs only to be swept in the first round by the indiana pacers losing all games by blowout margins
the celtics were a young team under new coach doc rivers during the season having drafted youngsters al jefferson delonte west and tony allen in the draft
yet they seemed to have a core of good young players led by pierce and rookie al jefferson to go along with a group of able veterans
the celtics went and won their first atlantic division title since receiving a boost from returning star antoine walker in mid season
the pacers defeated them in the first round yet again with the series culminating in an embarrassing point loss in game at the fleet center
after the season walker was traded again this time to the miami heat
despite pierce s career season in which he averaged career highs in points the celtics missed the playoffs with a record owing largely to a young roster and constant roster shuffling which saw the likes of marcus banks ricky davis and mark blount traded for underachieving former first overall pick michael olowokandi and former all star wally szczerbiak
the celtics continued to rebuild in the nba draft
the celtics selected kentucky point guard rajon rondo who was to become a key piece in the team s revival
in the second round the celtics added center leon powe
the season was a gloomy one for the franchise starting with the death of red auerbach at
auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the nba since its inception in
the celtics went from late december through early february after losing pierce to injury the result of a stress reaction in his left foot
at first the celtics received a much needed boost from guard tony allen but he tore his acl and mcl on a needless dunk attempt after the whistle
the celtics compiled a record of second worst in the nba including a franchise record game losing streak
at the end of the season the celtics with the second worst record in the nba were at least hopeful that they could secure a high draft pick and select either greg oden or kevin durant to help rebuild the franchise but the celtics fell to fifth in the draft lottery
in the summer of general manager danny ainge made a series of moves that returned the celtics to prominence
on draft night he traded no
pick jeff green wally szczerbiak and delonte west to seattle for perennial all star ray allen and seattle s second round pick which the team used to select lsu s glen big baby davis
the celtics then traded ryan gomes gerald green al jefferson theo ratliff sebastian telfair and a first round draft pick to the timberwolves in exchange for superstar power forward kevin garnett
these moves created a new big three of pierce allen and garnett
in the season celtics completed the largest single season turnaround in nba history
the team went in the regular season a game improvement over its record
however the team struggled in the early rounds of the playoffs needing seven games to defeat the atlanta hawks in the first round and another seven to defeat the cleveland cavaliers in the conference semifinals
the celtics then beat the detroit pistons in six games in the eastern conference finals winning two road games
for the th time in league history and for the first time since the celtics and the lakers faced off in the nba finals
the celtics won game one at home fueled by strong play by garnett and pierce s dramatic comeback from a second half knee injury
they won game two despite nearly blowing a point lead in the fourth quarter
as the series shifted to los angeles the lakers stifled pierce and garnett in game three and won
however the celtics would overcome a point deficit in game to win making the largest in game comeback in nba finals history
after again blowing a large lead the lakers hung on to win game sending the series back to boston
in game the celtics overpowered the lakers winning and clinching their th nba title
paul pierce was named finals mvp
with the win celtics set a record for most games a team had ever played in a postseason with
the celtics started off the season at the then best starting record in nba history
they also had a franchise record game streak
after the all star break kevin garnett was injured in a loss against the utah jazz and missed the last games of the season
garnett was eventually shelved for the playoffs
the celtics still finished with victories but their playoff run would end against the magic in the second round
in with the return of garnett from injury and the additions of rasheed wallace and marquis daniels the celtics started the season and at one point had the best record in the nba
however doc rivers decided to lessen his aging stars minutes to keep them fresh for the playoffs
as a result the celtics sputtered to an even record the rest of the way and finished the regular season with a record
despite being the fourth seed in the eastern conference the celtics managed to make the nba finals
rajon rondo emerged as a star during postseason play
for the th time the celtics faced the lakers in the finals
after taking a lead heading into los angeles for game six the celtics appeared poised to win their th title
however starting center kendrick perkins suffered a severe knee injury early in game six and the celtics went on to lose the series in seven games
during the offseason with perkins expected to be out until february the celtics signed two former all star centers shaquille o neal and jermaine o neal
shaquille o neal s presence wound up leading to perkins departure the celtics were in games perkins had missed during the year due to injury and had a record in games when o neal played over minutes
consequently perkins was traded to the oklahoma city thunder in february when the celtics were and led the eastern conference despite another rash of injuries
following the trade however they proceeded to win only of their final games
they finished with a record sliding to the third seed
the season still provided three landmarks the celtics became the second team to reach victories paul pierce became the third celtic to score points the others are larry bird and john havlicek and ray allen broke the nba record for most career three pointers

the rivalry between the boston celtics and los angeles lakers involves the two most storied franchises in nba history
it has been called the nba s best rivalry
the two teams have met a record twelve times in the nba finals starting with their first finals meeting in
they would go on to dominate the league in the s and the s facing each other six times in the s three times in the s in and in
the rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of magic johnson and larry bird in the early s but in it was renewed as the celtics and lakers met in the finals for the first time since with the celtics winning the series in six games

the two teams are tied for the highest number of championships together the championships account for almost half of the championships in nba history
the celtics hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the eastern conference of the national basketball association that has lasted for over five decades although the two teams have played each other since the season when the then tri cities blackhawks joined the nba as part of the national basketball league and the basketball association of america merger
however the blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to st
louis as the st
louis hawks after a four year stopover at milwaukee
the two teams have faced each other eleven times in the nba playoffs four times in the nba finals with the celtics winning ten of twelve series against the hawks including three out of four nba finals
while the hawks have only defeated the celtics twice out of eleven series in the nba playoffs they still often managed to make their series with the celtics memorable
the rivalry intensified in with hawks all star center al horford spurning the team and joining the celtics
the boston celtics were once rivals of the new jersey nets during the early s due to their respective locations and their burgeoning stars
the nets were led by jason kidd and kenyon martin while the celtics were experiencing newfound success behind paul pierce and antoine walker
the rivalry began to heat up in the eastern conference finals which was preceded by trash talking from the celtics who claimed martin was a fake tough guy
things progressed as the series started and on court tensions seemed to spill into the stands
celtics fans berated kidd and his family with chants of wife beater in response to kidd s domestic abuse charge
when asked about the fan barbs being traded kenyon martin stated our fans hate them their fans hate us bill walton said at the time that nets celtics was the beginning of the next great nba rivalry during the eastern conference finals in with the nets advancing to the nba finals though new jersey would go on to sweep boston in the playoffs
in the year the nets returned to new york in the borough of brooklyn there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on november resulting in the ejection of rajon rondo gerald wallace and kris humphries
rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath while wallace and kevin garnett were fined
the story was revisited on december when wallace grabbed garnett s shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike
however the rivalry between the nets and the celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the june blockbuster trade that dealt celtics stars garnett and paul pierce to the nets in exchange for wallace humphries and others
this move was billed as a merger of the two atlantic division teams
celtics announcer sean grande said it s almost as if you found a great home for these guys
you couldn t have found a better place
these guys will be in the new york market they ll be on a competitive team they ll stay on national tv
it s funny because the enemy of my enemy is my friend
so with celtics fans feeling the way they do about the heat feeling the way they do about the knicks the nets are going to become almost the second boston team now the trade would end up crippling the nets who posted a record of following the trade including three consecutive seasons with fewer than wins from to
brooklyn would win just one playoff series with garnett and pierce neither of whom were with the team by the close of the season
the celtics would use brooklyn s draft picks to acquire jaylen brown and jayson tatum through the draft in and respectively and kyrie irving via trade en route to consecutive appearances in the eastern conference finals in and
irving then left to the nets in the free agency
the rivalry between the celtics and the detroit pistons peaked in the s featuring players such as larry bird kevin mchale robert parish isiah thomas bill laimbeer dennis rodman and joe dumars
these teams met in the nba playoffs five times in seasons from to with the celtics winning in and and the pistons coming out on top en route to back to back finals appearances in and their championship seasons of and
led by paul pierce kevin garnett and ray allen in the eastern conference finals the celtics defeated the pistons in games to advance to the nba finals where they went on to beat the lakers also in games
the rivalry between the celtics and the new york knicks stems from the location of the teams both of which are in the nba s atlantic division

one of the most recent and unexpected rivalries that has been created between the celtics is with the washington wizards
although both teams had engaged in a fight in the rivalry intensified during the season in a january regular season game after jae crowder was given a technical foul
crowder then began to exchange words with then wizards coach randy wittman
it began to escalate that off season when the celtics were trying to sign al horford
it was publicly reported that jae crowder emphasized that the celtics beat the wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign with them rather than washington
in their first meeting of the season wall hit marcus smart in the back court when they were up by late in the th quarter
wall was hit with a flagrant foul and was promptly ejected
smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with wall
their words continued even after being separated with wall telling smart to meet him out back after the game
no incident was reported between the two following the game
in their next meeting the celtics won
however after the game wall and crowder exchanged words in front of the wizards bench
crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at wall s nose and wall tried to fight back with a slap
teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms
police officers had to be on guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation
otto porter is quoted as calling the celtics as dirty
isaiah thomas replied if playing hard is dirty then i guess we are a dirty team
in their next game in january the wizards wore all black to enter the game
the notion was that it is similar to the attire of a funeral
their decision worked as they defeated the celtics
the two teams would go on to meet in the conference semifinals in the playoffs
in game markieff morris landed on horford s ankle after shooting a jumpshot
morris sprained his ankle and had to miss the rest of the game which was a loss
morris believed that horford did this intentionally
