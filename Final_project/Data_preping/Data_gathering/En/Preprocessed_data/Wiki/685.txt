it also has regional offices in caernarfon and cardiff
as of s c had an average of employees
s c is the fourth oldest terrestrial television channel in wales after bbc one itv and bbc two
as with channel which launched the very next day in the rest of the uk s c commissions all of its programmes from independent producers
bbc cymru wales produces programmes for s c as part of its public service remit including the news service newyddion
from its launch until s c also carried english language programming acquired from channel which could not be received over the air in most of wales these programmes aired in non peak hours and did not always air in pattern with channel s scheduling
on digital terrestrial television s c has broadcast exclusively in welsh since the platform s launch in with the existing bilingual schedule continuing on analogue television
after the completion of the digital switchover in wales on march channel became available on freeview and s c ceased its carriage of english language programmes
s c offers translated english language subtitles for its welsh programming
before the launch of s c on monday november welsh speakers had been served by occasional programmes in welsh broadcast as regional opt outs on bbc cymru wales and htv cymru wales the itv franchise in wales usually at off peak or inconvenient times
this was unsatisfactory for welsh speakers who saw the arrangement as a sop and at the same time an annoyance for non welsh speakers who found the english language programmes seen in the rest of the uk often rescheduled or not transmitted at all
on september the itv network had created a licence area for north and west wales which was awarded to wales west and north limited
this traded as teledu cymru and provided significant levels of welsh language programming
however problems with transmission infrastructure and poor market research led to financial difficulties within two years and after going bankrupt the station was taken over by its neighbour television wales and the west
during the s welsh language activists had campaigned for a television service in the language which already had its own radio station bbc radio cymru
both the conservative and labour parties promised a welsh language fourth channel if elected to government in the general election
shortly after the conservatives won a majority in the election the new home secretary william whitelaw decided against a welsh fourth channel and suggested that except for an occasional opt out the service should be the same as that offered in the rest of the uk
this led to acts of civil disobedience including refusals to pay the television licence fee thereby running the risk of prosecution or even a prison sentence and sit ins in bbc and htv studios
some took more extreme measures including attacking television transmitters in welsh speaking areas
on september the former president of plaid cymru gwynfor evans threatened to go on hunger strike if the conservative government of margaret thatcher did not honour its commitment to provide a welsh language television service
s c started broadcasting on november

the university owns the land where the canolfan s c yr egin s c yr egin centre would be built
the building would also be home to other companies in the creative industries
there was a strong bid for relocation to caernarfon but there was disappointment that the bid was unsuccessful
in it was revealed that s c was paying million upfront rent to uwtsd and that it would pay rent over the next years
concern was expressed about the arrangement and the lack of transparency around commercial payments between two publicly funded bodies
the university of wales trinity saint david applied for funding for the building work and received m from the welsh government and a further m from the swansea bay city deal
in june it was revealed that more staff would be leaving the channel than moving to work in carmarthen
s c started relocating to the new building from september and jobs moved to the new hq
an office in cardiff was retained for technical purposes until full changeover to the new bbc wales headquarters with staff there

liz scourfield s first live presentation aired later that morning before the news bulletin at
s c s remit is to provide a service which features a wide range of programmes in the welsh language
like channel s c does not produce programmes of its own instead it commissions programmes from bbc cymru wales and independent producers although the quantity purchased from itv cymru wales has greatly reduced since the early years of s c and it has particularly developed a reputation for commissioning children s animation such as superted rocky hollow fireman sam also broadcast by the bbc gogs shakespeare the animated tales animated tales of the world and the french co production natalie
bbc cymru wales fulfils its public service requirement by producing programmes in welsh including newyddion s c s news bulletin and a soap opera pobol y cwm and providing them to s c free of charge
it has also provided or licensed welsh language versions of english language programmes such as the original teletubbies
on the analogue service s c showed programmes produced for channel in the rest of the united kingdom either simultaneously or time shifted outside of peak hours
these programmes were provided to s c by channel free of charge
to make content more accessible to english speakers all welsh language programming carries english subtitles
