SC Welsh pronunciation ˌɛs ˌpɛdwar ˈɛk Sianel Pedwar Cymru meaning Channel Four Wales is a Welsh-language and a Welsh English language free-to-air television channel
Launched on November it was the first television channel to be aimed specifically at a Welsh-speaking audience
SC's headquarters are based in Carmarthen at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David's creative and digital centre Yr Egin
It also has regional offices in Caernarfon and Cardiff
As of SC had an average of employees
SC is the fourth-oldest terrestrial television channel in Wales after BBC One ITV and BBC Two
As with Channel which launched the very next day in the rest of the UK SC commissions all of its programmes from independent producers
BBC Cymru Wales produces programmes for SC as part of its public service remit including the news service Newyddion
From its launch until SC also carried English-language programming acquired from Channel which could not be received over-the-air in most of Wales these programmes aired in non-peak hours and did not always air in pattern with Channel 's scheduling
On digital terrestrial television SC has broadcast exclusively in Welsh since the platform's launch in with the existing bilingual schedule continuing on analogue television
After the completion of the digital switchover in Wales on March Channel became available on Freeview and SC ceased its carriage of English-language programmes
SC offers translated English-language subtitles for its Welsh programming
Before the launch of SC on Monday November Welsh speakers had been served by occasional programmes in Welsh broadcast as regional opt-outs on BBC Cymru Wales and HTV Cymru Wales the ITV franchise in Wales usually at off-peak or inconvenient times
This was unsatisfactory for Welsh speakers who saw the arrangement as a sop and at the same time an annoyance for non-Welsh speakers who found the English-language programmes seen in the rest of the UK often rescheduled or not transmitted at all
On September the ITV network had created a licence area for North and West Wales which was awarded to Wales West and North Limited
This traded as Teledu Cymru and provided significant levels of Welsh-language programming
However problems with transmission infrastructure and poor market research led to financial difficulties within two years and after going bankrupt the station was taken over by its neighbour Television Wales and the West
During the s Welsh-language activists had campaigned for a television service in the language which already had its own radio station BBC Radio Cymru
Both the Conservative and Labour parties promised a Welsh-language fourth channel if elected to government in the general election
Shortly after the Conservatives won a majority in the election the new Home Secretary William Whitelaw decided against a Welsh fourth channel and suggested that except for an occasional opt-out the service should be the same as that offered in the rest of the UK
This led to acts of civil disobedience including refusals to pay the television licence fee thereby running the risk of prosecution or even a prison sentence and sit-ins in BBC and HTV studios
Some took more extreme measures including attacking television transmitters in Welsh-speaking areas
On September the former president of Plaid Cymru Gwynfor Evans threatened to go on hunger strike if the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher did not honour its commitment to provide a Welsh-language television service
In September SC began a study into the possible relocation of its headquarters
In March it was announced that Carmarthen was the winner with a bid led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David
The university owns the land where the Canolfan SC Yr Egin SC Yr Egin Centre would be built
The building would also be home to other companies in the creative industries
There was a strong bid for relocation to Caernarfon but there was disappointment that the bid was unsuccessful
In it was revealed that SC was paying £ million upfront rent to UWTSD and that it would pay rent over the next years
Concern was expressed about the arrangement and the lack of transparency around commercial payments between two publicly funded bodies
The University of Wales Trinity Saint David applied for funding for the building work and received £m from the Welsh Government and a further £m from the Swansea Bay city deal
In June it was revealed that more staff would be leaving the channel than moving to work in Carmarthen
SC started relocating to the new building from September and jobs moved to the new HQ
An office in Cardiff was retained for technical purposes until full changeover to the new BBC Wales Headquarters with staff there
A significant percentage of the technical posts were to transfer to the BBC
In September SC committed to ten years of lease on its Caernarfon office which has full-time staff
In January SC's Presentation Library Promotion and Commercial departments moved to BBC Wales headquarters in Central Square Cardiff
The first programmes were broadcast from there January beginning with the channel's children's service Cyw at am
Liz Scourfield's first live presentation aired later that morning before the news bulletin at
SC's remit is to provide a service which features a wide range of programmes in the Welsh language
Like Channel SC does not produce programmes of its own instead it commissions programmes from BBC Cymru Wales and independent producers although the quantity purchased from ITV Cymru Wales has greatly reduced since the early years of SC and it has particularly developed a reputation for commissioning children's animation such as SuperTed Rocky Hollow Fireman Sam also broadcast by the BBC Gogs Shakespeare The Animated Tales Animated Tales of the World and the French co-production Natalie
BBC Cymru Wales fulfils its public service requirement by producing programmes in Welsh including Newyddion SC's news bulletin and a soap opera Pobol y Cwm and providing them to SC free of charge
It has also provided or licensed Welsh-language versions of English-language programmes such as the original Teletubbies
On the analogue service SC showed programmes produced for Channel in the rest of the United Kingdom either simultaneously or time-shifted outside of peak hours
These programmes were provided to SC by Channel free of charge
To make content more accessible to English speakers all Welsh-language programming carries English subtitles
Originally these were on Sbectel teletext page with Welsh subtitles on page with both subtitle languages now also available on digital television platforms
For speakers of English who are learning Welsh certain programmes particularly children's programmes Planed Plant Bach now Cyw and Planed Plant now Stwnsh carry subtitles featuring Welsh subtitles with additional English translations in brackets next to more difficult Welsh-language words
TV films produced for SC have received some good foreign reviews Hedd Wyn was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar in and Solomon Gaenor was nominated in
The SC analogue signal also spilled over on to the east coast of Ireland
In the past it was rebroadcast in a number of areas there on UHF terrestrial signals by so-called 'deflectors'
Up until the s SC was also carried by some Irish cable and MMDS providers before being replaced by Channel
The SC channels continue to be available in the Republic of Ireland via the Freesat satellite service
Up until SC ran its own teletext service Sbectel Sbec Welsh for a peek or a glimpse and a reference to an SC schedule insert formerly included in the TVTimes issues for the HTV Wales region
million people throughout the UK watched SC on television at some time during
The number of people who watched SC on TV every week throughout the UK increased from in to in
On an average week in approximately people in Wales watched SC on TV
Welsh speakers in Wales watched SC each week during this period

The BARB rolling four-week viewing figures for January were across the UK
If scaled up for Wales alone this would be just a audience share
The programme that enjoyed the channel's highest viewing figures in - was Sgorio's coverage of Wales' Euro qualifier match against Hungary in November which drew viewers
There were also million viewing sessions of SC content on Facebook Twitter and YouTube in with million viewing sessions of SC content on SC Arlein and BBC iPlayer
When digital terrestrial television launched in SC added a second full-time Welsh-language channel called SC Digidol 'digital' on November
Following the switch-off of analogue terrestrial signals on March Wales became the first fully digital region in the UK with both SC and Channel becoming available to all homes
As a result SC now broadcasts solely in the Welsh language and as well as on Freeview in Wales is available throughout Britain Ireland and the rest of western Europe on Freesat and Sky
A review commissioned by the Department for Culture Media and Sport in suggested that SC should operate a single core service after digital switchover
In addition SC also operated a sister channel SC until
It formerly broadcast coverage of the National Assembly for Wales when in session
The programme content was provided by the BBC who from January now make it available online and via BBC Parliament
Like the main channel SC was available within Wales on Freeview and throughout the UK and Ireland on Freesat and Sky
SC had two audio feeds allowing viewers to select between an untranslated version and an English-only version where all Welsh spoken is translated into English
Delayed coverage of Assembly proceedings is now broadcast overnight on SC's main channel on Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays
In addition to the analogue TV signal transmitted throughout Wales SC along with United News Media owned the company SC Digital Networks SDN
SDN was awarded the UK-wide contract to provide half a digital multiplex worth of programming
The other half continues to belong to the broadcaster Channel
On April SC sold its share of SDN to ITV plc for approximately £ million though it still has the half-multiplex as of right in Wales
ITV already owned some of SDN due to the consolidation of the ITV industry Granada bought UNM's stake in SDN and this was then incorporated into the united ITV plc
In January SC announced plans to launch a Welsh-language children's service
The new service in the form of a programming block launched on June
Under the name Cyw chick it brings together a wide range of programmes for nursery-age children and SC plans eventually to extend the service to include the Stwnsh strand for older children and a third service for teenagers and young people

SC launched a high-definition simulcast of SC called 'Clirlun' on July to coincide with terrestrial digital switchover in Wales
Clirlun was broadcast on Freeview channel only and not via other platforms

Its idents were filmed around various parts of the country and themed around magnetism—representing the uncontrollable attraction of Welsh people and their emotional affinity to the homeland whether near or far
The magnetism-themed idents were later accompanied by a new set developed in collaboration with the agency Minivegas consisting of live-action scenes with dynamic animated elements that can react to the voice of the continuity announcer
A new SC logo and brand developed by Sugar Creative Studio was introduced on April the new design was developed around a concept of providing context to SC's target audience and programming
The design revolves heavily around a trapezium shape used within the channel's new logo which is prominently used within aspects of the channel's overall marketing and branding
SC has faced criticism for poor viewing figures since its launch
Leaked internal reports in March showed that 'over the -day period from February to last Saturday March as many as of the programmes put out by SC were rated as having zero viewers'
The story was widely reported across the UK and was referenced in Parliament by the then Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt
In response an SC spokesperson stated that of those programmes were aimed at pre-school children and that BARB the organisation that compiles television ratings in the UK only takes into account viewers aged four years and over
The remaining consisted of repeats and daytime news bulletins which did not attract the minimum viewers necessary to register on a UK-wide analysis

Assembly members and Members of Parliament requested an independent investigation into the circumstances leading up to her departure
The SC Authority refused to comment further and commissioned a review into how the broadcaster was governed in August

From its inception SC was in part publicly financed funding came both from its advertising revenue and a fixed annual grant from the UK Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport DCMS receiving £m in and then £m in after the Conservative Party won the general elections in which consequently made considerable cuts to its funding
Additionally some Welsh-language programming including Newyddion and Pobol y Cwm was produced by BBC Wales as part of the BBC's public service remit and provided to SC free of charge
There is an agreement in place until for hours a week of programming to be provided to SC which is valued at £m annually
From responsibility for funding SC began to transfer to the BBC with the DCMS reducing its funding by by
The BBC was to provide around £m of funding to SC by this date resulting in a cut of around to SC's annual budget
In it was agreed that the BBC would provide £m a year funding to SC from the licence fee until
The UK government announced in that it would continue providing £m until with the aim of SC being funded wholly from the licence fee from
