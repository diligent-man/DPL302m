As with Channel which launched the very next day in the rest of the UK S C commissions all of its programmes from independent producers BBC Cymru Wales produces programmes for S C as part of its public service remit including the news service Newyddion From its launch until S C also carried English language programming acquired from Channel which could not be received over the air in most of Wales these programmes aired in non peak hours and did not always air in pattern with Channel 's scheduling

Before the launch of S C on Monday November Welsh speakers had been served by occasional programmes in Welsh broadcast as regional opt outs on BBC Cymru Wales and HTV Cymru Wales the ITV franchise in Wales usually at off peak or inconvenient times This was unsatisfactory for Welsh speakers who saw the arrangement as a sop and at the same time an annoyance for non Welsh speakers who found the English language programmes seen in the rest of the UK often rescheduled or not transmitted at all
On September the ITV network had created a licence area for North and West Wales which was awarded to Wales West and North Limited This traded as Teledu Cymru and provided significant levels of Welsh language programming However problems with transmission infrastructure and poor market research led to financial difficulties within two years and after going bankrupt the station was taken over by its neighbour Television Wales and the West
During the s Welsh language activists had campaigned for a television service in the language which already had its own radio station BBC Radio Cymru Both the Conservative and Labour parties promised a Welsh language fourth channel if elected to government in the general election Shortly after the Conservatives won a majority in the election the new Home Secretary William Whitelaw decided against a Welsh fourth channel and suggested that except for an occasional opt out the service should be the same as that offered in the rest of the UK This led to acts of civil disobedience including refusals to pay the television licence fee thereby running the risk of prosecution or even a prison sentence and sit ins in BBC and HTV studios Some took more extreme measures including attacking television transmitters in Welsh speaking areas

In June it was revealed that more staff would be leaving the channel than moving to work in Carmarthen S C started relocating to the new building from September and jobs moved to the new HQ An office in Cardiff was retained for technical purposes until full changeover to the new BBC Wales Headquarters with staff there A significant percentage of the technical posts were to transfer to the BBC In September S C committed to ten years of lease on its Caernarfon office which has full time staff In January S C's Presentation Library Promotion and Commercial departments moved to BBC Wales headquarters in Central Square Cardiff The first programmes were broadcast from there January beginning with the channel's children's service Cyw at a m Liz Scourfield's first live presentation aired later that morning before the news bulletin at
