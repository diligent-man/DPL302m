The history of the Auvergne dates back to the early Middle Ages, when it was a historic province in south central France
It was originally the feudal domain of the Counts of Auvergne.
Auvergne was a province of France deriving its name from the Arverni, a Gallic tribe who once occupied the area, well known for its fierce resistance, led by Vercingetorix, to conquest by Julius Caesar and the late Roman Republic
Christianized by Saint Austremoine, Auvergne was quite prosperous during the Roman period
After a short time under the Visigoths, it was conquered by the Franks in 507.
During the earlier medieval period, Auvergne was a county within the duchy of Aquitaine and from time to time part of the "Angevin Empire"
In 1225, Louis VIII of France granted Poitou and Auvergne to his third son Alfonso
On Alfonso's death in 1271, Auvergne, along with the County of Toulouse, Poitou and the Comtat Venaissin, reverted to the royal domain.
The Middle Ages, especially the 10th to 13th centuries, were a period of great development for Auvergne, with the building of famous abbeys and churches in a Romanesque style
In 1095, the historic Council of Clermont was held there, to rally support for the First Crusade
Its wide autonomy was ended by King Philippe-Auguste of France, who linked it to the royal possessions
Severely impacted by the Hundred Years' War, the religion wars and epidemics, integrated to the kingdom of France, it turned itself more and more into an agricultural province, although reputed for its products
In 1790, the historical province was divided into the modern-day départements of Puy-de-Dôme, Cantal, Haute-Loire, and Allier, although Haute-Loire and Allier also include some land from the historical provinces of Bourbonnais, Lyonnais, and Velay.
The region is famed for its charcuterie, which is celebrated in "La Mangona" festivals in many Auvergnat villages, for its cheeses (Saint-Nectaire, Bleu d'Auvergne, Cantal, Salers, Fourme d'Ambert), and for its mineral waters (Volvic, among others)
Michelin tires are produced there
Auvergne is also the site of several major hydroelectric projects, mainly located on the rivers Dordogne, Cère, and Truyère
The region is also quite touristic, thanks to its landscapes.
