modern interpretation historical archaeological anthropological evidence ha proposed two broad hypothesis scythian origins
first hypothesis formerly espoused soviet russian researcher roughly followed herodotus' account scythian eastern iranian-speaking group arrived inner asia ie
second hypothesis according roman ghirshman others proposes scythian cultural complex emerged local group srubna culture black sea coast although also associated cimmerians
according pavel dolukhanov proposal supported anthropological evidence ha found scythian skull similar preceding finding srubna culture distinct central asian saka
mallory archaeological evidence poor andronovo culture least eastern outlier timber-grave culture may identified indo-iranian
genetic study scythian suggested best described mixture european-related ancestry yamna culture east asiansiberian ancestry emerged pontic steppe
author concluded evidence significant geneflow east-eurasia west-eurasia various migration early iron age
based analysis mithocondrial lineage another later study suggested scythian directly descended srubnaya culture
later analysis paternal lineage published found significant genetic difference srubnaya scythians
scythian genetically heterogeneous carried genetic affinity population several region including far east southern urals
another study also concluded migration must played part emergence scythian dominant power pontic steppe
study also revealed contemporary population linked western iron age steppe people found among diverse ethnic group caucasus russia central asia spread across many iranian indo-european speaking group whereas population genetic similarity eastern scythian group found almost exclusively among turkic peoples
contemporary descendant western scythian group found among various group caucasus central asia similarity eastern scythian found widespread almost exclusively among turkic language speaking nomadic group particularly kipchak branch turkic languages
scythian originated central asia arrived caucasian steppe century bce part significant movement nomadic people eurasian steppe

first mention scythian record neo-assyrian empire bce king ipakaia joined mannaeans cimmerians attack assyria wa killed battle assyrian king esarhaddon
unlike ipakaia bartatua sought rapprochement assyrian bce asked hand esarhaddon's daughter serua-eterat marriage attested esarhaddon's question oracle sun-god shamash
whether marriage happen recorded assyrian text close alliance scythian assyria bartatua's reign suggested matrimonial alliance happen possible serua-eterat might mother bartatua's son madyes henceforth scythian remained ally assyrian empire started unravelling death esarhaddon's son ashurbanipal
bartatua's marriage assyrian princess required would pledge allegiance assyria vassal accordance assyrian law territory ruled would fief granted assyrian king made scythian presence western asia nominal extension neo-assyrian empire

splinter scythian group nevertheless remained western asia settled transcaucasia area corresponding modern-day azerbaijan
