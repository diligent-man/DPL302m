the scythians from ancient greek sk th s sk thoi or scyths also known as saka and sakae old persian sak ancient egyptian romanized sk s g ancient greek s kai latin sacae and ishkuzai akkadian i kuzaya or askuzai akkadian asguzaya mat askuzaya mat guzaya were an ancient nomadic people living primarily in the region known as scythia which today comprises the eurasian steppes of kazakhstan the russian steppes of the siberian ural volga and southern regions and eastern ukraine
classical scythians dominated the pontic steppe from approximately the th century bc until the rd century bc
they can also be referred to as pontic scythians
they were part of the wider scythian cultures stretching across the eurasian steppe
in a broader sense scythians has also been used to designate all early eurasian nomads although the validity of such terminology is controversial
according to di cosmo other terms such as early nomadic would be preferable
eastern members of the scythian cultures are often specifically designated as sakas
the scythians are generally believed to have been of iranian origin they spoke a language of the scythian branch of the iranian languages and practiced a variant of ancient iranian religion
among the earliest peoples to master mounted warfare the scythians replaced the cimmerians as the dominant power on the pontic steppe in the th century bc
during this time they and related peoples came to dominate the entire eurasian steppe from the carpathian mountains in the west to ordos plateau in the east creating what has been called the first central asian nomadic empire
based in what is modern day ukraine and southern russia they called themselves scoloti ancient greek sk lotoi and were led by a nomadic warrior aristocracy known as the royal scythians
in the th century bc the scythians crossed the caucasus and frequently raided the middle east along with the cimmerians playing an important role in the political developments of the region
around bc scythians briefly dominated the medes of the western iranian plateau stretching their power to the borders of egypt
after losing control over media they continued intervening in middle eastern affairs playing a leading role in the destruction of the assyrian empire in the sack of nineveh in bc
the scythians subsequently engaged in frequent conflicts with the achaemenid empire and suffered a major defeat against macedonia in the th century bc and were subsequently gradually conquered by the sarmatians a related iranian people living to their west
in the late nd century bc their capital at scythian neapolis in the crimea was captured by mithridates vi and their territories incorporated into the bosporan kingdom
by this time they had been largely hellenized
by the rd century ad the sarmatians and last remnants of the scythians were dominated by the alans and were being overwhelmed by the goths
by the early middle ages the scythians and the sarmatians had been largely assimilated and absorbed by early slavs
the scythians were instrumental in the ethnogenesis of the ossetians who are believed to be descended from the alans
the scythians played an important part in the silk road a vast trade network connecting greece persia india and china perhaps contributing to the prosperity of those civilisations
settled metalworkers made portable decorative objects for the scythians forming a history of scythian metalworking
these objects survive mainly in metal forming a distinctive scythian art
the name of the scythians survived in the region of scythia
early authors continued to use the term scythian applying it to many groups unrelated to the original scythians such as huns goths turkic peoples avars bulgars khazars and other unnamed nomads
the scientific study of the scythians is called scythology
linguist oswald szemer nyi studied synonyms of various origins for scythian and differentiated the following terms skuthes skudra sug da and saka
from the indo european root s kewd meaning propel shoot cognate with english shoot of which skud is the zero grade form was descended the scythians self name reconstructed by szemer nyi as sku a roughly archer
from this were descended the following exonyms
akkadian i kuzaya and askuzaya used by the assyrians
old persian skudra
ancient greek sk th s plural sk thai used by the ancient greeksthe old armenian skiwt is based on itacistic greeka late scythian sound change from to l resulted in the evolution of sku a into skula
from this was derived the greek word sk lotoi which according to herodotus was the self designation of the royal scythians
other sound changes have produced sug da
from an iranian verbal root sak go roam and thus meaning nomad was derived the term saka from which came the names
old persian sak used by the ancient persians to designate all nomads of the eurasian steppe including the scythians
ancient greek
latin sacae
sanskrit akaalthough both were closely related nomadic iranians peoples the saka are to be distinguished from the european scythians and inhabited the northern and eastern eurasian steppe and the tarim basin
in scholarship the term scythians generally refers to the nomadic iranian people who dominated the pontic steppe from the th century bc to the rd century bc
the scythians share several cultural similarities with other populations living to their east in particular similar weapons horse gear and scythian art which has been referred to as the scythian triad
cultures sharing these characteristics have often been referred to as scythian cultures and its peoples called scythians
peoples associated with scythian cultures include not only the scythians themselves who were a distinct ethnic group but also cimmerians massagetae saka sarmatians and various obscure peoples of the forest steppe such as early slavs balts and finnic peoples
within this broad definition of the term scythian the actual scythians have often been distinguished from other groups through the terms classical scythians western scythians european scythians or pontic scythians
scythologist askold ivantchik notes with dismay that the term scythian has been used within both a broad and a narrow context leading to a good deal of confusion
he reserves the term scythian for the iranian people dominating the pontic steppe from the th century bc to the rd century bc
nicola di cosmo writes that the broad concept of scythian is too broad to be viable and that the term early nomadic is preferable
modern interpretation of historical archaeological and anthropological evidence has proposed two broad hypotheses on scythian origins
the first hypothesis formerly more espoused by soviet and then russian researchers roughly followed herodotus account of the scythians as an eastern iranian speaking group who arrived from inner asia i e
from the area of turkestan and western siberia
the second hypothesis according to roman ghirshman and others proposes that the scythian cultural complex emerged from local groups of the srubna culture at the black sea coast although this is also associated with the cimmerians
according to pavel dolukhanov this proposal is supported by anthropological evidence which has found that scythian skulls are similar to preceding findings from the srubna culture and distinct from those of the central asian saka
yet according to j
mallory the archaeological evidence is poor and the andronovo culture and at least the eastern outliers of the timber grave culture may be identified as indo iranian
in a genetic study of the scythians suggested that they can best be described as a mixture of european related ancestry from the yamna culture and an east asian siberian ancestry and emerged on the pontic steppe
the authors concluded that there is evidence for significant geneflow from east eurasia to west eurasia from various migrations during the early iron age
based on the analysis of mithocondrial lineages another later study suggested that the scythians were directly descended from the srubnaya culture
a later analysis of paternal lineages published in found significant genetic differences between the srubnaya and the scythians
they further found that the nomadic population of central asia e g
the scythians were genetically heterogeneous and carried genetic affinities with populations from several other regions including the far east and the southern urals
another study also concluded that migrations must have played a part in the emergence of the scythians as the dominant power of the pontic steppe
the same study also revealed that contemporary populations linked to western iron age steppe people can be found among diverse ethnic groups in the caucasus russia and central asia spread across many iranian and other indo european speaking groups whereas populations with genetic similarities to eastern scythian groups are found almost exclusively among turkic peoples
contemporary descendants of western scythian groups are found among various groups in the caucasus and central asia while similarities to eastern scythian are found to be more widespread but almost exclusively among turkic language speaking nomadic groups particularly from the kipchak branch of turkic languages
the scythians originated in central asia and they arrived in the caucasian steppe in the th and th centuries bce as part of a significant movement of the nomadic peoples of the eurasian steppe
this movement started when the massagetae another nomadic iranian tribe closely related to the scythians migrated westwards forcing the scythians to the west across the araxes river following which the scythians moved into the caucasian steppe displaced the cimmerians who were also a nomadic iranian people closely related to the scythians and conquered their territory
under scythian pressure the cimmerians fled to the south along the coast of the black sea and reached anatolia and the scythians in turn pursued the cimmerians following the coast of the caspian sea and arrived in the steppes in the northern caucasus from where they expanded into the region of present day azerbaijan where they settled around what is today mingachevir ganja and the mugan plain and turned eastern transcaucasia into their centre of operations until the early th century bce
while the earlier modern view of the scythian presence in western asia held that a separate group of scythians had migrated there the more recent view is that the scythians in western asia never lost contact with the scythian kingdom of the steppes and their activities in fact constituted a series of lengthy military expeditions in western asia rather than an attempt at permanent conquest
during this period the scythian kings headquarters were located in the steppes to the north of caucasus and contact with the civilisation of western asia would have an important influence on the formation of scythian culture
from their base in the caucasian steppe the scythians conquered the pontic steppe to the north of the black sea during the period of the th to th centuries bce itself
the scythians conquest of the pontic steppe displaced another nomadic iranian people related to them the agathyrsi who were the oldest iranian population to have dominated the pontic steppe
the agathyrsi were pushed westwards by the scythians away from the steppes and their original home around lake maeotis after which the relations between the agathyrsi and the scythians remained hostile
the agathyrsi settled in the territories of present day moldavia transylvania and possibly oltenia where they mingled with the indigenous population who were largely thracians became acculturated to the local thracian getic populations although they retained iranian names for their kings such as agathyrsus and spargapeithes and eventually became completely assimilated by the geto thracian populations and disappeared from history
the first mention of the scythians in the records of the neo assyrian empire is from between and bce when their king i pakaia joined the mannaeans and the cimmerians in an attack on assyria and was killed in battle by the assyrian king esarhaddon
i pakaia was succeeded by bartatua who might have been his son
unlike i pakaia bartatua sought a rapprochement with the assyrians and in bce he asked the hand of esarhaddon s daughter serua eterat in marriage which is attested in esarhaddon s questions to the oracle of the sun god shamash
whether this marriage did happen is not recorded in the assyrian texts but the close alliance between the scythians and assyria under bartatua s reign suggested that this matrimonial alliance did happen and it is possible that serua eterat might have been the mother of bartatua s son madyes henceforth the scythians remained allies of the assyrian empire until it started unravelling after the death of esarhaddon s son ashurbanipal
bartatua s marriage to the assyrian princess required that he would pledge allegiance to assyria as a vassal and in accordance to assyrian law the territories ruled by him would be his fief granted by the assyrian king which made the scythian presence in western asia a nominal extension of the neo assyrian empire
under this arrangement the power of the scythians in western asia heavily depended on their cooperation with the assyrian empire
bartatua was succeeded by his son madyes who would bring scythian power in western asia to its peak
in bce madyes invaded the medes an iranian people native to western asia who were engaged in a war against assyria and the median king phraortes was killed in battle either against the assyrians or against madyes
madyes then imposed scythian hegemony over media for twenty eight years on behalf of the assyrians thus starting a period which herodotus called the scythian rule over asia
madyes soon expanded the scythian hegemony to the states of mannae and urartu
in bce the thracian treres tribe who had migrated across the thracian bosporus and invaded anatolia under their king kobos and in alliance with the cimmerians and the lycians attacked the kingdom of lydia during the seventh year of the reign of the lydian king ardys
they defeated the lydians and captured the capital city of lydia sardis except for its citadel and ardys might have been killed in this attack
ardys s son and successor sadyattes might possibly also have been killed in another cimmerian attack on lydia in bce
soon after bce with assyrian approval and in alliance with the lydians the scythians under madyes entered anatolia expelled the treres from asia minor and defeated the cimmerians so that they no longer constituted a threat again following which the scythians extended their domination to central anatolia until they were themselves expelled by the medes from western asia in the s bce
this final defeat of the cimmerians was carried out by the joint forces of madyes who strabo credits with expelling the cimmerians from asia minor and of gyges s great grandson the king alyattes of lydia whom herodotus and polyaenus claim finally defeated the cimmerians
by the s bce the assyrian empire began unravelling after the death of ashurbanipal
in addition to internal instability within assyria itself babylon revolted against the assyrians in bce
the next year in bce cyaxares the son of phraortes and his successor to the median kingship overthrew the scythian yoke over the medes by inviting the scythian rulers to a banquet and then murdering them all after getting them drunk madyes was likely killed during this massacre
shortly after some time between and bce the scythians took advantage of the power vacuum created by the crumbling of the power of their former assyrian allies and overran the levant and reached as far south as palestine until the egyptian pharaoh psamtik i met them and convinced them to turn back by offering them gifts
the scythians retreated by passing through ascalon largely without any incident although some stragglers looted the temple of astarte in the city which was considered to be the most ancient of all temples to that goddess
according to herodotus the goddess punished the perpetrators of the sack of her temple and their descendants with a female disease due to which they became a class of transvestite diviners called the enarees in scythian anarya meaning unmanly
according to babylonian records starting around bce the scythians were operating as allies of cyaxares and the medes in their war against assyria and were finally expelled from western asia by the medes in the s bce after which they retreated to the pontic steppe
some splinter scythian groups nevertheless remained in western asia and settled in transcaucasia and the area corresponding to modern day azerbaijan
one such splinter group likely joined the medes and participated in the median conquest of urartu while some other transcaucasian scythian splinter groups might have retreated northwards to join the scythians who had already moved into the kuban steppe previously
one group formed a kingdom in what is now azerbaijan under median overlordship but eventually hostilities broke out between them and cyaxares due to which they left transcaucasia and fled to the kingdom of lydia as refugees although a section of these scythians still remained in the southeast caucasus and were later mentioned by livy under the name of sacassani while the country was called the land of the skythenoi by xenophon and sakasene by ptolemy
by the middle of the th century bce the scythians who had remained in western asia had completely assimilated culturally and politically into median society and no longer existed as a distinct group
after their expulsion from western asia and beginning in the later th and lasting throughout much of the th century bce the majority of the scythians migrated from the northern caucasus into the pontic steppe which became the centra of scythian power
using the pontic steppe as their base the scythians often raided into the adjacent regions with central europe being a frequent target of their raids and scythian incursions reaching transylvania podolia and the hungarian plain due to which new objects originating from the steppes startd appearing in central europe from the end of the th century onwards and which included weapons and horse equipment
multiple fortified settlements of the lusatian culture were destroyed by scythian attacks during this period
in the th century bc the greeks had begun establishing settlements along the coasts and rivers of the pontic steppe coming in contact with the scythians
relations between the greeks and the scythians appear to have been peaceful with the scythians being substantially influenced by the greeks although the city of the panticapaeum might have been destroyed by the scythians in the mid century bc
during this time the scythian philosopher anacharsis traveled to athens where he made a great impression on the local people with his barbarian wisdom
by the late th century bc the achaemenid king darius the great had built persia into becoming the most powerful empire in the world stretching from egypt to india
planning an invasion of greece darius first sought to secure his northern flank against scythian introads
thus darius declared war on the scythians
at first darius sent his cappadocian satrap ariamnes with a vast fleet estimated at ships by herodotus into scythian territory where several scythian nobles were captured
he then built a bridge across the bosporus and easily defeated the thracians crossing the danube into scythian territory with a large army men if one is to believe herodotus in bc
at this time scythians were separated into three major kingdoms with the leader of the largest tribe king idanthyrsus being the supreme ruler and his subordinate kings being scopasis and taxacis
unable to receive support from neighboring nomadic peoples against the persians the scythians evacuated their civilians and livestock to the north and adopted a scorched earth strategy while simultaneously harassing the extensive persian supply lines
suffering heavy losses the persians reached as far as the sea of azov until darius was compelled to enter into negotiations with idanthyrsus which however broke down
darius and his army eventually reatreated across the danube back into persia and the scythians thereafter earned a reputation of invincibility among neighboring peoples
in the aftermath of their defeat of the persian invasion scythian power grew considerably and they launched campaigns against their thracian neighbors in the west
in bc the scythians launched an great expedition into thrace reaching as far as chersonesos
during this time they negotiated an alliance with the achaemenid empire against the spartan king cleomenes i
a prominent king of the scythians in the th century bc was scyles
the scythian offensive against the thracians was checked by the odrysian kingdom
the border between the scythians and the odrysian kingdom was thereafter set at the danube and relations between the two dynasties were good with dynastic marriages frequently occurring
the scythians also expanded towards the north west where they destroyed numerous fortified settlements and probably subjucated numerous settled populations
a similar fate was suffered by the greek cities of the northwestern black sea coast and parts of the crimea over which the scythians established political control
greek settlements along the don river also came under the control of the scythians
a division of responsibility developed with the scythians holding the political and military power the urban population carrying out trade and the local sedentary population carrying out manual labor
their territories grew grain and shipped wheat flocks and cheese to greece
the scythians apparently obtained much of their wealth from their control over the slave trade from the north to greece through the greek black sea colonial ports of olbia chersonesos cimmerian bosporus and gorgippia
when herodotus wrote his histories in the th century bc greeks distinguished scythia minor in present day romania and bulgaria from a greater scythia that extended eastwards for a day ride from the danube river across the steppes of today s east ukraine to the lower don basin
scythian offensives against the greek colonies of the northeastern black sea coast were largely unsuccessful as the greeks united under the leadership of the city of panticapaeum and put up a vigorous defence
these greek cities developed into the bosporan kingdom
meanwhile several greek colonies formerly under scythian control began to reassert their independence
it is possible that the scythians were suffering from internal troubles during this time
by the mid th century bc the sarmatians a related iranian people living to the east of the scythians began expanding into scythian territory
the th century bc was a flowering of scythian culture
the scythian king ateas managed to unite under his power the scythian tribes living between the maeotian marshes and the danube while simultaneously encroaching upon the thracians
he conquered territories along the danube as far the sava river and established a trade route from the black sea to the adriatic which enabled a flourishing of trade in the scythian kingdom
the westward expansion of ateas brought him into conflict with philip ii of macedon reigned to bc with whom he had previously been allied who took military action against the scythians in bc
ateas died in battle and his empire disintegrated
philip s son alexander the great continued the conflict with the scythians
in bc his general zopyrion invaded scythian territory with a force of men but was routed and killed by the scythians near olbia
during the end of the th century bce the scythians were military defeated by a macedonian king again this time by lysimachus in and bce after which they experienced another military setback after participating in the bosporan civil war in bce and they came under pressure from the thracian getae and the germanic bastarnae
in the aftermath of conflict between macedon and the scythians another nomadic iranian people related to the scythians the sarmatians overwhelmed them beginning in the late th century bce while the celts and germanic bastarnae displaced the scythians from the balkans during the rd century bce
as the result of the sarmatian getic celtic and bastarnae advances the scythian kingdom disappeared from the pontic steppe and the scythians themselves became limited to small enclaves in crimea dobruja and nearby regions
by around bc the scythians had largely withdrawn into the crimea
by the time of strabo s account the first decades ad the crimean scythians had created a new kingdom extending from the lower dnieper to the crimea centered at scythian neapolis near modern simferopol
they had become more settled and were intermingling with the local populations in particular the tauri and were also subjected to hellenization
they maintained close relations with the bosporan kingdom with whose dynasty they were linked by marriage
a separate scythian territory known as scythia minor existed in modern day dobruja but was of little significance
in the nd century bc the scythian kings skilurus and palakus sought to extend their control over the greek cities north of the black sea
the greek cities of chersonesus and olbia in turn requested the aid of mithridates the great king of pontus whose general diophantus defeated their armies in battle took their capital and annexed their territory to the bosporan kingdom
after this time the scythians practically disappeared from history
scythia minor was also defeated by mithridates
in the years after the death of mithridates the scythians had transitioned to a settled way of life and were assimilating into neighboring populations
they made a resurgence in the st century ad and laid siege to chersonesos who were obliged to seek help from the roman empire
the scythians were in turn defeated by roman commander tiberius plautius silvanus aelianus
by the nd century ad archaeological evidence show that the scythians had been largely assimilated by the sarmatians and alans
the capital city of the scythians scythian neapolis was destroyed by migrating goths in the mid rd century ad
in subsequent centuries remaining scythians and sarmatians were largely assimilated by early slavs
the scythians and sarmatians played an instrumental role in the ethnogenesis of the ossetians who are considered direct descendants of the alans
archaeological remains of the scythians include kurgan tombs ranging from simple exemplars to elaborate royal kurgans containing the scythian triad of weapons horse harness and scythian style wild animal art gold silk and animal sacrifices in places also with suspected human sacrifices
mummification techniques and permafrost have aided in the relative preservation of some remains
scythian archaeology also examines the remains of cities and fortifications
scythian archaeology can be divided into three stages
early scythian from the mid th or the late th century bc to about bc
classical scythian or mid scythian from about bc to about bc
late scythian from about bc to the mid rd century ce in the crimea and the lower dnieper by which time the population was settled in the south of eastern europe early scythian culture replaced sites of the so called novocherkassk culture
the date of this transition is disputed among archaeologists
dates ranging from the mid th century to the late th century bc have been proposed
a transition in the late th century bc has gained the most scholarly support
the origins of the early scythian culture is controversial
many of its elements are of central asian origin but the culture appears to have reached its ultimate form on the pontic steppe partially through the influence of north caucasian elements and to a smaller extent the influence of near eastern elements
the period in the th and th centuries bc when the cimmerians and scythians raided the near east are ascribed to the later stages of the early scythian culture
examples of early scythian burials in the near east include those of nor untepe and i mirler
objects of early scythian type have been found in urartian fortresses such as teishebaini bastam and ayanis kale
near eastern influences are probably explained through objects made by near eastern craftsmen on behalf of scythian chieftains
early scythian culture is known primarily from its funerary sites because the scythians at this time were nomads without permanent settlements
the most important sites are located in the northwestern parts of scythian territories in the forest steppes of the dnieper and the southeastern parts of scythian territories in the north caucasus
at this time it was common for the scythians to be buried in the edges of their territories
early scythian sites are characterized by similar artifacts with minor local variations
kurgans from the early scythian culture have been discovered in the north caucasus
some if these are characterized by great wealth and probably belonged royals of aristocrats
they contain not only the deceased but also horses and even chariots
the burial rituals carried out in these kurgans correspond closely with those described by herodotus
the greatest kurgans from the early scythian culture in the north caucasus are found at kelermesskaya novozavedennoe ii ulsky kurgans ru and kostromskaya
one kurgan at ulsky was found measured at metres in height and contained more than horses
kurgans from the th century bc when the scythians were raiding the near east typically contain objects of near eastern origin
kurgans from the late th century bc however contain few middle eastern objects but rather objects of greek origin pointing to increased contacts between the scythians and greek colonists
important early scythian sites have also been found in the forest steppes of the dnieper
the most important of these finds is the melgunov kurgan uk
this kurgan contains several objects of near eastern origin so similar to those found at the kurgan in kelermesskaya that they were probably made in the same workshop
most of the early scythian sites in this area are situated along the banks of the dnieper and its tributaries
the funerary rites of these sites are similar but not identical to those of the kurgans in the north caucasus
important early scythian sites have also been discovered in the areas separating the north caucasus and the forest steppes
these include the krivorozhski kurgan on the eastern banks of the donets and the temir gora kurgan in the crimea
both date to the th century bc and contain greek imports
the krivorozhski also display near eastern influences
apart from funerary sites numerous settlements from the early scythian period have been discovered
most of these settlements are located in the forest steppe zone and are non fortified
the most important of these sites in the dnieper area are trakhtemirovo motroninskoe uk and pastyrskoe
east of these at the banks of the vorskla river a tributary of the dnieper lies the bilsk settlement
occupying an area of hectares with an outer rampart at over km bilsk is the largest settlement in the forest steppe zone
it has been tentatively identified by a team of archaeologists led by boris shramko as the site of gelonus the purported capital of scythia
another important large settlement can be found at myriv
dating from the th and th centuries bc myriv contains a significant amount of imported greek objects testifying to lively contacts with borysthenes the first greek colony established on the pontic steppe ca
within the ramparts in these settlements there were areas without buildings which were probably occupied by nomadic scythians seasonally visiting the sites
the early scythian culture came to an end in the latter part of the th century bc
by the end of the th century bc a new period begins in the material culture of the scythians
certain scholars consider this a new stage in the scythian culture while others consider it an entirely new archaeological culture
it is possible that this new culture arose through the settlement of a new wave of nomads from the east who intermingled with the local scythians
the classical scythian period saw major changes in scythian material culture both with regards to weapons and art style
this was largely through greek influence
other elements had probably been brought from the east
like in early scythian culture the classical scythian culture is primarily represented through funerary sites
the area of distribution of these sites has however changed
most of them including the richest are located on the pontic steppe in particular the area around the dnieper rapids
at the end of the th century bc new funerary rites appeared characterized by more complex kurgans
this new style was rapidly adopted throughout scythian territory
like before elite burials usually contained horses
a buried king was usually accompanied with multiple people from his entourage
burials containing both males and females are quite common both in elite burials and in the burials of the common people
the most important scythian kurgans of the classical scythian culture in the th and th centuries bc are ostraya tomakovskaya mogila zavadskaya mogila novogrigor evka baby and raskopana mogila in the dnieper rapids and the zolotoi and kulakovski kurgans in the crimea
the greatest so called royal kurgans of the classical scythian culture are dated to the th century bc
these include solokha bol shaya cymbalka uk chertomlyk ru oguz uk
alexandropol ru and
kozel uk
the second greatest so called aristocratic kurgans include berdyanskii ru tovsta mohyla chmyreva mogila five brothers melitopolsky ru zheltokamenka uk and krasnokutskio ru
excavation at kurgan sengileevskoe found gold bowls with coatings indicating a strong opium beverage was used while cannabis was burning nearby
the gold bowls depicted scenes showing clothing and weapons
by the time of classical scythian culture the north caucasus appears to no longer be under scythian control
rich kurgans in the north caucasus have been found at the seven brothers hillfort ru elizavetovka ru and ulyap but although they contain elements of scythian culture these probably belonged to an unrelated local population
rich kurgans of the forest steppe zone from the th and th centuries bc have been discovered at places such as ryzhanovka ru but these are not as grand as the kurgans of the steppe further south
funerary sites with scythian characteristics have also been discovered in several greek cities
these include several unusually rich burials such as kul oba near panticapaeum in the crimea and the necropolis of nymphaion
the sites probably represent scythian aristocrats who had close ties if not family ties with the elite of nymphaion and aristocrats perhaps even royals of the bosporan kingdom
in total more than scythian funerary sites from the th century bc have been discovered on the pontic steppe
this number far exceeds the number of all funerary sites from previous centuries
apart from funerary sites remains of scythian cities from this period have been discovered
these include both continuations from the early scythian period and newly founded settlements
the most important of these is the settlement of kamenskoe ru on the dniepr which existed from the th century to the beginning of the rd century bc
it was a fortified settlement occupying an area of square km
the chief occupation of its inhabitants appears to have been metalworking and the city was probably an important supplier of metalwork for the nomadic scythians
part of the population was probably composed of agriculturalists
it is likely that kamenskoe also served as a political center in scythia
a significant part of kamenskoe was not built up perhaps to set it aside for the scythian king and his entourage during their seasonal visits to the city
j nos harmatta suggests that kamenskoe served as a residence for the scythian king ateas
by the th century bc it appears that some of the scythians were adopting an agricultural way of life similar to the peoples of the forest steppes
as a result a number of fortified and non fortified settlements spring up in the areas of the lower dnieper
part of the settled inhabitants of olbia were also of scythian origin
classical scythian culture lasts until the late th century or early rd century bc
the last period in the scythian archaeological culture is the late scythian culture which existed in the crimea and the lower dnieper from the rd century bc
this area was at the time mostly settled by scythians
archaeologically the late scythian culture has little in common with its predecessors
it represents a fusion of scythian traditions with those of the greek colonists and the tauri who inhabited the mountains of the crimea
the population of the late scythian culture was mainly settled and were engaged in stockbreeding and agriculture
they were also important traders serving as intermediaries between the classical world and the barbarian world
recent excavations at ak kaya vishennoe ru implies that this site was the political center of the scythians in the rd century bc and the early part of the nd century bc
it was a well protected fortress constructed in accordance with greek principles
the most important site of the late crimean culture is scythian neaoplis which was located in crimea and served as the capital of the late scythian kingdom from the early nd century bc to the beginning of the rd century ad
scythian neapolis was largely constructed in accordance with greek principles
its royal palace was destroyed by diophantus a general of the pontic king mithridates vi at the end of the nd century bc and was not rebuilt
the city nevertheless continued to exist as a major urban center
it underwent significant change from the st century to the nd century ad eventually being left with virtually no buildings except from its fortifications
new funerary rites and material features also appear
it is probable that these changes represent the assimilation of the scythians by the sarmatians
a certain continuity is however observable
from the end of the nd century to the middle of the rd century ad scythian neapolis transforms into a non fortified settlement containing only a few buildings
apart from scythian neapolis and ak kaya vishennoe more than fortified and non fortified settlements from the late scythian culture have been discovered
they are often accompanied by a necropolis
late scythian sites are mostly found in areas around the foothills of the crimean mountains and along the western coast of the crimea
some of these settlements had earlier been greek settlements such as kalos limen and kerkinitis
many of these coastal settlements served as trading ports
the largest scythian settlements after neapolis and ak kaya vishennoe were bulganak ru ust alma ru and kermen kyr ru
like neapolis and ak kaya these are characterized by a combination of greek architectural principles and local ones
a unique group of late scythian settlements were city states located on the banks of the lower dnieper
the material culture of these settlements was even more hellenized than those on the crimea and they were probably closely connected to olbia if not dependent it
burials of the late scythian culture can be divided into two kurgans and necropolises with necropolises becoming more and more common as time progresses
the largest such necropolis has been found at ust alma
because of close similarities between the material culture of the late scythians and that of neighbouring greek cities many scholars have suggested that late scythian cites particularly those of the lower dnieper were populated at last partly by greeks
influences of sarmatian elements and the la t ne culture have been pointed out
the late scythian culture ends in the rd century ad
since the scythians did not have a written language their non material culture can only be pieced together through writings by non scythian authors parallels found among other iranian peoples and archaeological evidence
in a fragment from the comic writer euphron quoted in deipnosophistae poppy seeds are mentioned as a food which the scythians love
scythians lived in confederated tribes a political form of voluntary association which regulated pastures and organised a common defence against encroaching neighbours for the pastoral tribes of mostly equestrian herdsmen
while the productivity of domesticated animal breeding greatly exceeded that of the settled agricultural societies the pastoral economy also needed supplemental agricultural produce and stable nomadic confederations developed either symbiotic or forced alliances with sedentary peoples in exchange for animal produce and military protection
herodotus relates that three main tribes of the scythians descended from three sons of targitaus lipoxais arpoxais and colaxais
they called themselves scoloti after one of their kings
herodotus writes that the auchatae tribe descended from lipoxais the catiari and traspians from arpoxais and the paralatae royal scythians from colaxais who was the youngest brother
according to herodotus the royal scythians were the largest and most powerful scythian tribe and looked upon all the other tribes in the light of slaves
although scholars have traditionally treated the three tribes as geographically distinct georges dum zil interpreted the divine gifts as the symbols of social occupations illustrating his trifunctional vision of early indo european societies the plough and yoke symbolised the farmers the axe the warriors the bowl the priests
the first scholar to compare the three strata of scythian society to the indian castes was arthur christensen
according to dum zil the fruitless attempts of arpoxais and lipoxais in contrast to the success of colaxais may explain why the highest strata was not that of farmers or magicians but rather that of warriors
the scythians were a warlike people
when engaged at war almost the entire adult population including a large number of women participated in battle
the athenian historian thucydides noted that no people in either europe or asia could resist the scythians without outside aid
scythians were particularly known for their equestrian skills and their early use of composite bows shot from horseback
with great mobility the scythians could absorb the attacks of more cumbersome footsoldiers and cavalry just retreating into the steppes
such tactics wore down their enemies making them easier to defeat
the scythians were notoriously aggressive warriors
ruled by small numbers of closely allied elites scythians had a reputation for their archers and many gained employment as mercenaries
scythian elites had kurgan tombs high barrows heaped over chamber tombs of larch wood a deciduous conifer that may have had special significance as a tree of life renewal for it stands bare in winter
the greek historian herodotus said that the scythians scalped their enemies
herodotus related that scythian warriors would behead the enemies they defeated in battle and present the heads to their king to claim their share of the plunder
then the warrior would skin the head by making a circular cut round the ears and shaking out the skull he then scrapes the flesh off the skin with the rib of an ox and when it is clean works it with his fingers until it is supple and fit to be used as a sort of handkerchief
he hangs these handkerchiefs on the bridle of his horse and is very proud of them
the best man is the man who has the greatest number a skull from an iron age cemetery in south siberia shows evidence of scalping
it lends physical evidence to the practice of scalp taking by the scythians living there
the ziwiye hoard a treasure of gold and silver metalwork and ivory found near the town of sakiz south of lake urmia and dated to between and bc includes objects with scythian animal style features
one silver dish from this find bears some inscriptions as yet undeciphered and so possibly representing a form of scythian writing
scythians also had a reputation for the use of barbed and poisoned arrows of several types for a nomadic life centred on horses fed from horse blood according to herodotus and for skill in guerrilla warfare
some scythian sarmatian cultures may have given rise to greek stories of amazons
graves of armed females have been found in southern ukraine and russia
david anthony notes about of scythian sarmatian warrior graves on the lower don and lower volga contained females dressed for battle as if they were men a style that may have inspired the greek tales about the amazons
though a predominantly nomadic people for much of their history the scythians were skilled metalworkers
knowledge of bronze working was present when the scythian people formed by the th century bc scythian mercenaries fighting in the near east had begun to spread knowledge of iron working to their homeland
archeological sites attributed to the scythians have been found to contain the remnants of workshops slag piles and discarded tools all of which imply some scythian settlements were the site of organized industry
according to herodotus scythian costume consisted of padded and quilted leather trousers tucked into boots and open tunics
they rode without stirrups or saddles using only saddle cloths
herodotus reports that scythians used cannabis both to weave their clothing and to cleanse themselves in its smoke hist
archaeology has confirmed the use of cannabis in funerary rituals
men seemed to have worn a variety of soft headgear either conical like the one described by herodotus or rounder more like a phrygian cap
costume has been regarded as one of the main identifying criteria for scythians
women wore a variety of different headdresses some conical in shape others more like flattened cylinders also adorned with metal golden plaques
scythian women wore long loose robes ornamented with metal plaques gold
women wore shawls often richly decorated with metal golden plaques
based on numerous archeological findings in ukraine southern russia and kazakhstan men and warrior women wore long sleeve tunics that were always belted often with richly ornamented belts
men and women wore long trousers often adorned with metal plaques and often embroidered or adorned with felt appliqu s trousers could have been wider or tight fitting depending on the area
materials used depended on the wealth climate and necessity
men and women warriors wore variations of long and shorter boots wool leather felt gaiter boots and moccasin like shoes
they were either of a laced or simple slip on type
women wore also soft shoes with metal gold plaques
men and women wore belts
warrior belts were made of leather often with gold or other metal adornments and had many attached leather thongs for fastening of the owner s gorytos sword whet stone whip etc
belts were fastened with metal or horn belt hooks leather thongs and metal often golden or horn belt plates
scythian religion was a type of pre zoroastrian iranian religion and differed from the post zoroastrian iranian thoughts
the scythian belief was a more archaic stage than the zoroastrian and hindu systems
the use of cannabis to induce trance and divination by soothsayers was a characteristic of the scythian belief system
our most important literary source on scythian religion is herodotus
according to him the leading deity in the scythian pantheon was tabiti whom he compared to the greek god hestia
tabiti was eventually replaced by atar the fire pantheon of iranian tribes and agni the fire deity of indo aryans
other deities mentioned by herodotus include papaios api goitosyros oitosyros argimpasa and thagimasadas whom he identified with zeus gaia apollo aphrodite and poseidon respectively
the scythians are also said by herodotus to have worshipped equivalents of heracles and ares but he does not mention their scythian names
an additional scythian deity the goddess dithagoia is mentioned in the a dedication by senamotis daughter of king skiluros at panticapaeum
most of the names of scythian deities can be traced back to iranian roots
herodotus states that thagimasadas was worshipped by the royal scythians only while the remaining deities were worshipped by all
he also states that ares the god of war was the only god to whom the scythians dedicated statues altars or temples
tumuli were erected to him in every scythian district and both animal sacrifices and human sacrifices were performed in honor of him
at least one shrine to ares has been discovered by archaeologists
the scythians had professional priests but it is not known if they constituted a hereditary class
among the priests there was a separate group the enarei who worshipped the goddess argimpasa and assumed feminine identities
scythian mythology gave much importance to myth of the first man who was considered the ancestor of them and their kings
similar myths are common among other iranian peoples
considerable importance was given to the division of scythian society into three hereditary classes which consisted of warriors priests and producers
kings were considered part of the warrior class
royal power was considered holy and of solar and heavenly origin
the iranian principle of royal charisma known as khvarenah in the avesta played a prominent role in scythian society
it is probable that the scythians had a number of epic legends which were possibly the source for herodotus writings on them
traces of these epics can be found in the epics of the ossetians of the present day
in scythian cosmology the world was divided into three parts with the warriors considered part of the upper world the priests of the middle level and the producers of the lower one
the art of the scythians and related peoples of the scythian cultures is known as scythian art
it is particularly characterized by its use of the animal style
scythian animal style appears in an already established form eastern europe in the th century bc along with the early scythian archaeological culture itself
it bears little resemblance to the art of pre scythian cultures of the area
some scholars suggest the art style developed under near eastern influence during the military campaigns of the th century bc but the more common theory is that it developed on the eastern part of the eurasian steppe under chinese influence
others have sought to reconcile the two theories suggesting that the animal style of the west and eastern parts of the steppe developed independently of each other under near eastern and chinese influences respectively
regardless the animal style art of the scythians differs considerable from that of peoples living further east
scythian animal style works are typically divided into birds ungulates and beasts of prey
this probably reflects the tripatriate division of the scythian cosmos with birds belonging to the upper level ungulates to the middle level and beasts of prey in the lower level
images of mythological creatures such a griffins are not uncommon in scythian animal style but these are probably the result of near eastern influences
by the late th century bc as scythian activity in the near east was reduced depictions of mythological creatures largely disappears from scythian art
it however reappears again in the th century bc as a result of greek influence
anthropomorphic depictions in early scythian art is known only from kurgan stelae
these depict warriors with almond shaped eyes and mustaches often including weapons and other military equipment
since the th century bc scythian art changed considerably
this was probably a result of greek and persian influence and possibly also internal developments caused by an arrival of a new nomadic people from the east
the changes are notable in the more realistic depictions of animals who are now often depicted fighting each other rather than being depicted individually
kurgan stelae of the time also display traces of greek influences with warriors being depicted with rounder eyes and full beards
the th century bc show additional greek influence
while animal style was still in use it appears that much scythian art by this point was being made by greek craftsmen on behalf of scythians
such objects are frequently found in royal scythian burials of the period
depictions of human beings become more prevalent
many objects of scythian art made by greeks are probably illustrations of scythian legends
several objects are believed to have been of religious significance
by the late rd century bc original scythian art disappears through ongoing hellenization
the creation of anthropomorphic gravestones continued however
works of scythian art are held at many museums and has been featured at many exhibitions
the largest collections of scythian art are found at the hermitage museum in saint petersburg and the museum of historical treasures of the ukraine in kyiv while smaller collections are found at the staatliche antikensammlungen in berlin the ashmolean museum of oxford and the louvre of paris
the scythians spoke a language belonging to the scythian languages most probably a branch of the eastern iranian languages
whether all the peoples included in the scytho siberian archaeological culture spoke languages from this family is uncertain
the scythian languages may have formed a dialect continuum scytho sarmatian in the west and scytho khotanese or saka in the east
the scythian languages were mostly marginalised and assimilated as a consequence of the late antiquity and early middle ages slavic and turkic expansion
the western sarmatian group of ancient scythian survived as the medieval language of the alans and eventually gave rise to the modern ossetian language
physical and genetic analyses of ancient remains have concluded that scythians as a whole possessed predominantly features of europoids
mongoloid phenotypes were also present in some scythians but more frequently in eastern scythians suggesting that some scythians were also descended partly from east eurasian populations
in artworks the scythians are portrayed exhibiting caucasoid traits
in histories the th century bc greek historian herodotus describes the budini of scythia as red haired and grey eyed
in the th century bc greek physician hippocrates argued that the scythians were light skinned as well as having a particularly high rate of hypermobility to a point of affecting warfare
in the rd century bc the greek poet callimachus described the arismapes arimaspi of scythia as fair haired
the nd century bc han chinese envoy zhang qian described the sai saka an eastern people closely related to the scythians as having yellow probably meaning hazel or green and blue eyes
in natural history the st century ad roman author pliny the elder characterises the seres sometimes identified as saka or tocharians as red haired blue eyed and unusually tall
in the late nd century ad the christian theologian clement of alexandria says that the scythians and the celts have long auburn hair
the nd century greek philosopher polemon includes the scythians among the northern peoples characterised by red hair and blue grey eyes
in the late nd or early rd century ad the greek physician galen writes that scythians sarmatians illyrians germanic peoples and other northern peoples have reddish hair
the fourth century roman historian ammianus marcellinus wrote that the alans a people closely related to the scythians were tall blond and light eyed
the fourth century bishop gregory of nyssa wrote that the scythians were fair skinned and blond haired
the th century physician adamantius who often followed polemon describes the scythians as fair haired
in a genetic study of various scythian samples was published in nature communications
the study suggested that the scythians arose as admixture between european related groups from the yamnaya culture and east asian siberian groups
further they found evidence for massive geneflow from east eurasia to west eurasia during the early iron age
while the origin of the scythian material culture is disputed their evidence suggest an origin in the east
modern populations relative closely related to the ancient scythians were found to be populations living in proximity to the sites studied suggesting genetic continuity
another genetic study published in scientific reports found that the scythians shared common mithocondrial lineages with the earlier srubnaya culture
it also noted that the scythians differed from materially similar groups further east by the absence of east eurasian mitochondrial lineages
the authors of the study suggested that the srubnaya culture was the source of the scythian cultures of at least the pontic steppe
krzewi ska et al
found that the historical central asian steppe population was genetically heterogeneous and carried genetic affinities with populations from several other regions including the far east and the southern urals
in a genetic study of remains from the aldy bel culture of southern siberia and proper scythians from the pontic caspian steppe which are materially similar to each other was published in human genetics
they identified scythians as mix of west eurasian and east eurasian lineages
east asian admixture was estimated at
the samples of aldy bel in contrast revealed increased east eurasian ancestry
the results indicated that the scythians and the aldy bel people were of different origins with almost no gene flow between them
j rve et al
found that the nomadic scythians were of different genetic origins
they suggested that migrations must have played a role in the emergence of the scythians as the dominant power on the pontic steppe
in late antiquity and the middle ages the name scythians was used in greco roman literature for various groups of nomadic barbarians living on the pontic caspian steppe
this includes huns goths ostrogoths turkic peoples pannonian avars and khazars
none of these peoples had any relation whatsoever with the actual scythians
byzantine sources also refer to the rus raiders who attacked constantinople circa in contemporary accounts as tauroscythians because of their geographical origin and despite their lack of any ethnic relation to scythians
patriarch photius may have first applied the term to them during the siege of constantinople
owing to their reputation as established by greek historians the scythians long served as the epitome of savagery and barbarism
the new testament includes a single reference to scythians in colossians in a letter ascribed to paul scythian is used as an example of people whom some label pejoratively but who are in christ acceptable to god
shakespeare for instance alluded to the legend that scythians ate their children in his play king lear
characteristically early modern english discourse on ireland such as that of william camden and edmund spenser frequently resorted to comparisons with scythians in order to confirm that the indigenous population of ireland descended from these ancient bogeymen and showed themselves as barbaric as their alleged ancestors
some legends of the poles the picts the gaels the hungarians among others also include mention of scythian origins
some writers claim that scythians figured in the formation of the empire of the medes and likewise of caucasian albania
the scythians also feature in some national origin legends of the celts
in the second paragraph of the declaration of arbroath the lite of scotland claim scythia as a former homeland of the scots
according to the th century lebor gab la renn the book of the taking of ireland the th century auraicept na n ces and other irish folklore the irish originated in scythia and were descendants of f nius farsaid a scythian prince who created the ogham alphabet
the carolingian kings of the franks traced merovingian ancestry to the germanic tribe of the sicambri
gregory of tours documents in his history of the franks that when clovis was baptised he was referred to as a sicamber with the words mitis depone colla sicamber adora quod incendisti incendi quod adorasti the chronicle of fredegar in turn reveals that the franks believed the sicambri to be a tribe of scythian or cimmerian descent who had changed their name to franks in honour of their chieftain franco in bc
in the th and th centuries foreigners regarded the russians as descendants of scythians
it became conventional to refer to russians as scythians in th century poetry and alexander blok drew on this tradition sarcastically in his last major poem the scythians
in the th century romantic revisionists in the west transformed the barbarian scyths of literature into the wild and free hardy and democratic ancestors of all blond indo europeans
based on such accounts of scythian founders of certain germanic as well as celtic tribes british historiography in the british empire period such as sharon turner in his history of the anglo saxons made them the ancestors of the anglo saxons
the idea was taken up in the british israelism of john wilson who adopted and promoted the idea that the european race in particular the anglo saxons were descended from certain scythian tribes and these scythian tribes as many had previously stated from the middle ages onward were in turn descended from the ten lost tribes of israel tudor parfitt author of the lost tribes of israel and professor of modern jewish studies points out that the proof cited by adherents of british israelism is of a feeble composition even by the low standards of the genre
legends about the origin of the population from the scythian ancestor targitai son of borisfen s daughter that was the name of the dnipro river in antiquity are popular in ukraine
in ukraine which territory herodotus described in his work on the scythians there are discussions about how serious the influence of the scythians was on the ethnogenesis of ukrainians
currently there are studies that indicate the relationship of slavic tribes living in ukraine with the scythian plowmen plough man and farmers who belonged to the proto slavic chernoles or black forest culture
the description of scythia by herodotus is also called the oldest description of ukraine
despite the absolute dissimilarity of modern ukrainian and hypothetical scythian languages researchers claim it still left some marks such as the fricative pronunciation of the letter the specific alternation etc
herodotus and other classical historians listed quite a number of tribes who lived near the scythians and presumably shared the same general milieu and nomadic steppe culture often called scythian culture even though scholars may have difficulties in determining their exact relationship to the linguistic scythians
a partial list of these tribes includes the agathyrsi geloni budini and neuri
