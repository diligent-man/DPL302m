The Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon or INSA Lyon is a French grande école and engineering school
The university is located on the La Doua – LyonTech campus, in a cluster of science and technological universities and Grandes Écoles
La Doua is located in Villeurbanne, a suburb of Lyon.
The school was founded in 1957 to train highly qualified engineers, support continuing education, and conduct research
The five-year curriculum aims at training engineers who possess human qualities and are well versed in the primary areas of science and engineering
Students may pursue a PhD upon completion of the 5-year curriculum
Graduates from INSA Lyon are called Insaliens.
The five-year academic curriculum starts with a two-year preparatory cycle where students focus on fundamental sciences such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, mechanics and computer science
This cycle aims to provide INSA engineers with a wide range of skills and competencies, thus allowing them to redirect their careers independently of their initial specialization.
Several special sections are available:
EURINSA, with half of the students coming from other European countries
AMERINSA, with half of the students coming from Latin American countries (mainly Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and Colombia)
ASINSA, with half of the students coming from Asian countries (mainly China, Vietnam, and Malaysia)
SCAN, with students coming from all over the world, and in which courses taught in English.
SHN, a section for high level athletes
5 art sections (Music, Plastic Arts, Theater, Dance and Cinema)
For the past ten years, INSA Lyon has been consistently the most desired Engineering school by French high school students who express their wishes through a national portal
The second cycle lasts 3 years and trains students in 9 departments of engineering:
Biosciences
Biochemistry & Biotechnologies
Bioinformatics and Modelling
Civil Engineering & Urban planning
Computer science
Electrical engineering
Energy and environmental engineering
Industrial engineering
Mechanical Engineering
Materials science and Engineering
Telecommunications engineeringINSA Lyon has a policy of encouraging international education.
Students are required to spend at least 6 months of their curriculum abroad, either during an internship or as an exchange student
INSA Lyon has over 200 partner universities around the world, 36 double degrees and 7 international laboratories.

INSA was awarded the title of the best sports university in France
The "Centre des Sports" (sports centre) is run by 18 specialised sports teachers and has four objectives: to supervise sports practices, to run the “Association Sportive” (Sports Association), to supervise students in the top athletes sports section, and to coordinate technological research applied to sports equipment.
This association brings together students who wish to specialise in the practice of a particular sport
It runs on the basis of one or more training session per week and participates in the French University Championships Approximately one third of INSA students are licensed with the Sports Association
The Association's achievements are excellent, with many French Championship titles being won every year
