Madden NFL is an American football video game based on the National Football League published by EA Sports and developed by EA Tiburon
EA's Chief Creative Officer Richard Hilleman said that defense would receive various changes in mechanics and controls one of the first known changes in the game
Part of the Madden NFL series the game was released in
For the first time in the series the game was officially released in Brazil due to the explosive growth of the sport in the country
This was the last Madden game released on the Wii the first and only to be released on the Wii U and PlayStation Vita and the final in the series to be available for non-mobile phone handhelds and Nintendo systems
It was the first game of the series since Madden NFL to not feature EA Trax and instead only had instrumental music which was met with criticism
A -player fan vote tournament to determine the cover athlete began on March
The vote-in round matched up a pair of teammates from each of the NFL teams the winners of which were seeded in a -player bracket
The cover features Calvin Johnson of the Detroit Lions
The NFL on CBS commentary crew of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms take the role as game announcers in the game
Nantz and Simms appear in an in-booth cutscene prior to the game including stadium-specific backgrounds
EA introduced + new cutscenes between plays games etc
The cutscenes are inspired by different TV presentations and were overhauled for dramatic effect
There is no halftime show instead being replaced by a stats overlay
The game contains all the new Nike homeaway uniforms including alternates on the disc
Additional uniforms were unlockable by code as they were released in real life
Lighting changes based on the time of day occur per play instead of just at quarter breaks
Madden NFL features the improved high dynamic range lighting and motion blur of NCAA Football
Ray Lewis appears in the introduction that features his real-life moments and shots taken from the gameEA Sports improved the left-analog stick passing controls so that the player can place the ball on a receiver's back shoulder out toward the sideline etc
where only the receiver can receive it
New pass trajectories and ball speeds open up even more areas of the field for passing game
New pass animations speed up the time in which quarterbacks get rid of the ball including a new shovel pass and specific set-ups for throws on the run
Pump fakes are now directed toward specific receivers occur faster and contain specific animations when performed outside of the pocket
Like NCAA Madden features more than new quarterback dropbacks including those for -step variations screens and plays with auto-pump fake dropbacks
To improve the receiving EA is including more than new catch animations some of which are fueled in part by the changes made to the left-analog passing stick
EA Tiburon says it also wants to make user catches easier to do by slowing down players when they select a receiver
The quarterbacks have new moves for avoiding the pass rush
A slowed down pocket speed gives the player more control when trying to avoid getting sacked
EA tweaked play-action to include an abort command that cancels the animation for those situations where a defender is barreling in unabated
The play-action also unravels faster in general
Running backs should be better in blocking after the fake as well as release for passes and defenders will be faked out more by play-action
Receivers have timing windows in their routes
When they expect the ball they'll turn their head to the quarterback
Until this time their passing icons are grayed out
Passing to a receiver who isn't expecting the ball will often result in an incompletion
However receivers will sometimes look for the ball earlier if the cornerback across the line of scrimmage blitzes or the receiver beats the jam at the lineNeither receivers nor defensive backs react to a ball unless they are expecting it like in the case of a quick slant for receivers or they have their heads turned and are looking at it
Defenses line-up opposite receivers in a best-on-best designation
This prevents the linebacker from matching up against an elite wide receiver lined up in the slot for instance
Defenses disguise their man or zone coverage before the snap so offenses can't try to use motion to uncover the defense's plans
Defenders use different coverage techniques such as off coverage where they start seven or so yards off the line of scrimmage and attempt to read the ball trail techniques including hand fighting and split techniques where the linebacker stands between the tight end and slot receiver
New animations allow for simultaneous tackles while the ball is being caught including being able to knock out the ball in mid-air and in general the development team says it's been working on the interplay between players while the ball is in the air
EA promises enhanced AI playcalling for two-minute drill goal line clock draining and red zone situations
New Infinity Engine improves tackle animations and the outcome of player interactions including a balance systemOver hours of commentary from Nantz and Simms to keep the audio new and different each time with over unique lines
Most of the lines are ad-libbed and Nantz and Simms regularly have interactions and comment on what is actually happening on the field
A new Madden NFL Theme composed by Colin O'Malley to be played at the beginning of the game as well as variations heard at quarter breaks halftime and postgame
- track fully orchestrated soundtrack also composed by O'Malley will replace EA Trax for the music on the menu screens and other game modes
Partnership with NFL Films to get exclusive sound clips such as QB cadences hitstackles and group chatter
New crowd noise recorded with microphones opposed to microphones in previous yearsSpecial teams coverage has been modified to prevent player clustering
EA also integrated cover and lane logic new formations and better wedges on returns
Madden's control scheme matches the control scheme on NCAA Football series

Connected Careers Combines Franchise Online Franchise and Superstar modes as well as historic players into one gameplay option
It will also make it no longer possible to import draft classes from NCAA Football do a fantasy draft play co-operatively on team during a game or control multiple teams throughout the Connected CareerAfter the success of the Madden NFL cover vote EA Sports again teamed up with ESPN's fan polling show SportsNation to bring the tournament back for this year's installment
The tournament began with a -player vote-in round during which fans were able to select from two players representing each NFL team
The teammates went head-to-head in a voting competition to see which player would qualify for the actual tournament bracket
By the end of the -player vote-in round the number of competitors was cut down to players with one player from each team
Due to offseason player movement however the New York Jets and New England Patriots began the tournament with two players while the Denver Broncos and St
This occurred because during the vote-in round March Tim Tebow was traded by the Broncos to the Jets after Denver acquired Peyton Manning and Brandon Lloyd left the Rams to sign with the Patriots
Both Tebow and Lloyd who had previously been teammates in Denver were eliminated in the first round
The initial bracket featured players who had previously appeared on the cover of Madden no player has been featured twice Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints Troy Polamalu of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Larry Fitzgerald of the Arizona Cardinals who appeared with Polamalu on the cover of

Calvin Johnson was eventually named the winner beating out Cam Newton to
