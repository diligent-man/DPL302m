wolf's basic social unit nuclear family consisting mated pair accompanied offspring
average pack size north america eight wolf europe wolves
average pack across eurasia consists family eight wolf two adult juvenile yearling sometimes two three family example exceptionally large pack consisting wolf known
cortisol level wolf rise significantly pack member dy indicating presence stress
time prey abundance caused calving migration different wolf pack may join together temporarily
trigger dispersal include onset sexual maturity competition within pack food
distance travelled dispersing wolf varies widely stay vicinity parental group individual may travel great distance upwards km mi km mi km mi natal birth packs
new pack usually founded unrelated dispersing male female travelling together search area devoid hostile packs
wolf pack rarely adopt wolf fold typically kill them
rare case wolf adopted adoptee almost invariably immature animal one three year old unlikely compete breeding right mated pair
adoptee male may mate available pack female form pack
case lone wolf adopted pack replace deceased breeder
wolf territorial generally establish territory far larger require survive assuring steady supply prey
territory size depends largely amount prey available age pack's pups
tend increase size area low prey population pup reach age six month nutritional need adults
wolf pack travel constantly search prey covering roughly territory per day average kmd mid
core territory average km sq mi spend time
except desperation wolf tend avoid hunting fringe range avoid fatal confrontation neighbouring packs
smallest territory record wa held pack six wolf northeastern minnesota occupied estimated km sq mi largest wa held alaskan pack ten wolf encompassing km sq mi
wolf pack typically settled usually leave accustomed range severe food shortages

wolf howl certain condition heard area km sq mi
wolf bark loudly continuously dog confrontation rather barking time retreating perceived danger
aggressive self-assertive wolf characterized slow deliberate movement high body posture raised hackle submissive one carry body low flatten fur lower ear tail
scent marking involves urine feces anal gland scents
effective advertising territory howling often used combination scratch marks
wolf increase rate scent marking encounter mark wolf packs
lone wolf rarely mark newly bonded pair scent mark most
mark generally left every yd throughout territory regular travelways junctions
marker last two three week typically placed near rock boulder tree skeleton large animals
raised leg urination considered one important form scent communication wolf making scent mark observed
wolf monogamous mated pair usually remaining together life
wolf become mature age two year sexually mature age three years
age first breeding wolf depends largely environmental factor food plentiful wolf population heavily managed wolf rear pup younger age better exploit abundant resources
female capable producing pup every year one litter annually average
oestrus rut begin second half winter last two weeks
building den female make use natural shelter like fissure rock cliff overhanging riverbank hole thickly covered vegetation
sometimes den appropriated burrow smaller animal fox badger marmots
rare occasion female wolf dig burrow usually small short one three openings
typically face southward better warmed sunlight exposure snow thaw quickly
resting place play area pup food remains commonly found around wolf dens
odor urine rotting food emanating denning area often attracts scavenging bird like magpie ravens
though mostly avoid area within human sight wolf known nest near domicile paved road railways

pup begin eat solid food age three four weeks
fast growth rate first four month life period pup's weight increase nearly times
wolf pup begin play-fighting age three week though unlike young coyote fox bite gentle controlled
actual fight establish hierarchy usually occur five eight week age
contrast young coyote fox may begin fighting even onset play behaviour
autumn pup mature enough accompany adult hunt large prey
single wolf mated pair typically higher success rate hunting large pack single wolf occasionally observed kill large prey moose bison muskoxen unaided

wolf move around territory hunting using trail extended periods
snowfall wolf find old trail continue using them
follow bank river shoreline lake ravine overgrown shrub plantation road human paths
winter pack commence hunting twilight early evening hunt night traveling ten kilometres
summer wolf generally tend hunt individually ambushing prey rarely giving pursuit
hunting large gregarious prey wolf try isolate individual group
successful wolf pack bring game feed day one error judgement lead serious injury death
wolf killed attempting bring bison elk moose muskoxen even one smallest hoofed prey white-tailed deer
smaller prey like beaver goose hare risk wolf
although people often believe wolf easily overcome prey success rate hunting hoofed prey usually low
wolf must give chase gain fleeing prey slow biting thick hair hide disable enough begin feeding
chasing confronting large prey animal wolf make use cm fang powerful masseter muscle deliver bite force kgcm lbfin capable breaking open skull many prey animals
one wolf wa observed dragged dozen metre attached hind leg moose another wa seen dragged fallen log attached bull elk's nose
wolf may wound large prey lie around resting hour killing weaker due blood loss thereby lessening risk injury themselves
medium-sized prey roe deer sheep wolf kill biting throat severing nerve track carotid artery thus causing animal die within second minute
small mouselike prey wolf leap high arc immobilize forepaws
prey brought wolf begin feed excitedly ripping tugging carcass direction bolting large chunk it
breeding pair typically monopolizes food continue producing pups
food scarce done expense family member especially non-pups
usually work hardest killing prey may rest long hunt allow rest family eat undisturbed
breeding pair ha finished eating rest family tear piece carcass transport secluded area eat peace
wolf typically commence feeding consuming larger internal organ like heart liver lung stomach lining
