the wolf canis lupus also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf is a large canine native to eurasia and north america
more than thirty subspecies of canis lupus have been recognized and gray wolves as popularly understood comprise wild subspecies
the wolf is the largest extant member of the family canidae
it is also distinguished from other canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail
the wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller canis species such as the coyote and the golden jackal to produce fertile hybrids with them
the banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white brown gray and black although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white
of all members of the genus canis the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey its more social nature and its highly advanced expressive behaviour including individual or group howling
it travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring
offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack
wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality
the wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved mammals as well as smaller animals livestock carrion and garbage
single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs
pathogens and parasites notably rabies virus may infect wolves
the global wild wolf population was estimated to be in and is considered to be of least concern by the international union for conservation of nature iucn
wolves have a long history of interactions with humans having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of their attacks on livestock while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter gatherer societies
the wolf is also considered the ancestor of the domestic dog
although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies
wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few live away from people and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters ranchers and shepherds
the english wolf stems from the old english wulf which is itself thought to be derived from the proto germanic wulfaz
the proto indo european root w k os may also be the source of the latin word for the animal lupus l k os
the name gray wolf refers to the grayish colour of the species
since pre christian times germanic peoples such as the anglo saxons took on wulf as a prefix or suffix in their names

in the swedish botanist and zoologist carl linnaeus published in his systema naturae the binomial nomenclature
canis is the latin word meaning dog and under this genus he listed the doglike carnivores including domestic dogs wolves and jackals
he classified the domestic dog as canis familiaris and the wolf as canis lupus
linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its cauda recurvata upturning tail which is not found in any other canid
in the third edition of mammal species of the world published in the mammalogist w
christopher wozencraft listed under c
lupus wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies familiaris linnaeus and dingo meyer
wozencraft included hallstromi the new guinea singing dog as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo
wozencraft referred to a mitochondrial dna mtdna study as one of the guides in forming his decision and listed the subspecies of c
lupus under the biological common name of wolf the nominate subspecies being the eurasian wolf c
lupus based on the type specimen that linnaeus studied in sweden
studies using paleogenomic techniques reveal that the modern wolf and the dog are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first domesticated
in a workshop hosted by the iucn species survival commission s canid specialist group considered the new guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral canis familiaris and therefore should not be assessed for the iucn red list
the phylogenetic descent of the extant wolf c
lupus from c
etruscus through c
mosbachensis is widely accepted
the earliest fossils of c
lupus were found in what was once eastern beringia at old crow yukon canada and at cripple creek sump fairbanks alaska
the age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years ago
considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the late pleistocene
they had more robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves often with a shortened snout a pronounced development of the temporalis muscle and robust premolars
it is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of pleistocene megafauna
compared with modern wolves some pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage similar to that seen in the extinct dire wolf
this suggests they either often processed carcasses or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly
compared with those found in the modern spotted hyena the frequency and location of tooth fractures in these wolves indicates they were habitual bone crackers
genomic studies suggest modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population that existed years ago
a study found that the himalayan wolf and the indian plains wolf are part of a lineage that is basal to other wolves and split from them years ago
other wolves appear to have originated in beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes during the close of the late pleistocene
a study in indicates that a population bottleneck was followed by a rapid radiation from an ancestral population at a time during or just after the last glacial maximum
this implies the original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out competed and replaced by more modern wolves
a genomic study suggests that old world and new world wolves split around years ago followed by the divergence of the lineage that led to dogs from other old world wolves around years ago
an extinct late pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog with the dog s similarity to the extant wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two
the dingo basenji tibetan mastiff and chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade
the divergence time for wolves in europe the middle east and asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around years ago
among new world wolves the mexican wolf diverged around years ago
in the distant past there has been gene flow between african wolves golden jackals and gray wolves
the african wolf is a descendant of a genetically admixed canid of wolf and ethiopian wolf ancestry
one african wolf from the egyptian sinai peninsula shows admixture with middle eastern gray wolves and dogs
there is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and middle eastern wolves less so with european and asian wolves and least with north american wolves
this indicates the golden jackal ancestry found in north american wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the eurasian and north american wolves
the common ancestor of the coyote and the wolf has admixed with a ghost population of an extinct unidentified canid
this canid is genetically close to the dhole and evolved after the divergence of the african hunting dog from the other canid species
the basal position of the coyote compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unidentified canid
similarly a museum specimen of a wolf from southern china collected in showed a genome that was admixed from this unknown canid
in north america most coyotes and wolves show varying degrees of past genetic admixture
the red wolf of the southeastern united states is a hybrid animal with wolf to coyote ancestry
in addition there was found to be wolf to coyote genetics in eastern timber wolves and in the great lakes region wolves
in more recent times some male italian wolves originated from dog ancestry which indicates female wolves will breed with male dogs in the wild
in the caucasus mountains ten percent of dogs including livestock guardian dogs are first generation hybrids
although mating between golden jackals and wolves has never been observed evidence of jackal wolf hybridization was discovered through mitochondrial dna analysis of jackals living in the caucasus mountains and in bulgaria
in a genetic study found that the dog s similarity to the extant gray wolf was the result of substantial dog into wolf gene flow with almost negligible wolf into dog gene flow since the dog s domestication
some gray wolves were related to all ancient and modern dogs
the wolf is the largest extant member of the canidae family and is further distinguished from coyotes and jackals by a broader snout shorter ears a shorter torso and a longer tail
it is slender and powerfully built with a large deeply descending rib cage a sloping back and a heavily muscled neck
the wolf s legs are moderately longer than those of other canids which enables the animal to move swiftly and to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range in winter
the ears are relatively small and triangular
the wolf s head is large and heavy with a wide forehead strong jaws and a long blunt muzzle
the skull is mm in in length and mm in in width
the teeth are heavy and large making them better suited to crushing bone than those of other canids
they are not as specialized as those found in hyenas though
its molars have a flat chewing surface but not to the same extent as the coyote whose diet contains more vegetable matter
females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads thinner necks slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males
adult wolves measure cm in in length and cm in at shoulder height
the tail measures cm in in length the ears mm in in height and the hind feet are mm in
the size and weight of the modern wolf increases proportionally with latitude in accord with bergmann s rule
the mean body mass of the wolf is kg lb the smallest specimen recorded at kg lb and the largest at kg lb
on average european wolves weigh kg lb north american wolves kg lb and indian and arabian wolves kg lb
females in any given wolf population typically weigh kg lb less than males
wolves weighing over kg lb are uncommon though exceptionally large individuals have been recorded in alaska and canada
in central russia exceptionally large males can reach a weight of kg lb
the wolf has very dense and fluffy winter fur with a short undercoat and long coarse guard hairs
most of the undercoat and some guard hairs are shed in spring and grow back in autumn
the longest hairs occur on the back particularly on the front quarters and neck
especially long hairs grow on the shoulders and almost form a crest on the upper part of the neck
the hairs on the cheeks are elongated and form tufts
the ears are covered in short hairs and project from the fur
short elastic and closely adjacent hairs are present on the limbs from the elbows down to the calcaneal tendons
the winter fur is highly resistant to the cold
wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at c f by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail
wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur and does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it
in cold climates the wolf can reduce the flow of blood near its skin to conserve body heat
the warmth of the foot pads is regulated independently from the rest of the body and is maintained at just above tissue freezing point where the pads come in contact with ice and snow
in warm climates the fur is coarser and scarcer than in northern wolves
female wolves tend to have smoother furred limbs than males and generally develop the smoothest overall coats as they age
older wolves generally have more white hairs on the tip of the tail along the nose and on the forehead
winter fur is retained longest by lactating females although with some hair loss around their teats
hair length on the middle of the back is mm in and the guard hairs on the shoulders generally do not exceed mm in but can reach mm in
a wolf s coat colour is determined by its guard hairs
wolves usually have some hairs that are white brown gray and black
the coat of the eurasian wolf is a mixture of ochreous yellow to orange and rusty ochreous orange red brown colours with light gray
the muzzle is pale ochreous gray and the area of the lips cheeks chin and throat is white
the top of the head forehead under and between the eyes and between the eyes and ears is gray with a reddish film
the neck is ochreous
long black tips on the hairs along the back form a broad stripe with black hair tips on the shoulders upper chest and rear of the body
the sides of the body tail and outer limbs are a pale dirty ochreous colour while the inner sides of the limbs belly and groin are white
apart from those wolves which are pure white or black these tones vary little across geographical areas although the patterns of these colours vary between individuals
in north america the coat colours of wolves follow gloger s rule wolves in the canadian arctic being white and those in southern canada the u s and mexico being predominantly gray
in some areas of the rocky mountains of alberta and british columbia the coat colour is predominantly black some being blue gray and some with silver and black
differences in coat colour between sexes is absent in eurasia females tend to have redder tones in north america
black coloured wolves in north america acquired their colour from wolf dog admixture after the first arrival of dogs across the bering strait to years ago
research into the inheritance of white colour from dogs into wolves has yet to be undertaken
wolves occur across eurasia and north america
however deliberate human persecution because of livestock predation and fear of attacks on humans has reduced the wolf s range to about one third of its historic range the wolf is now extirpated locally extinct from much of its range in western europe the united states and mexico and completely in ireland the united kingdom and japan
in modern times the wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas
the wolf can be found between sea level and m ft
wolves live in forests inland wetlands shrublands grasslands including arctic tundra pastures deserts and rocky peaks on mountains
habitat use by wolves depends on the abundance of prey snow conditions livestock densities road densities human presence and topography
like all land mammals that are pack hunters the wolf feeds predominantly on wild herbivorous hoofed mammals that can be divided into large size kg lb and medium size kg lb and have a body mass similar to that of the combined mass of the pack members
the wolf specializes in preying on the vulnerable individuals of large prey with a pack of able to bring down an adult moose
the variation in diet between wolves living on different continents is based on the variety of hoofed mammals and of available smaller and domesticated prey
in north america the wolf s diet is dominated by wild large hoofed mammals ungulates and medium sized mammals
in asia and europe their diet is dominated by wild medium sized hoofed mammals and domestic species
the wolf depends on wild species and if these are not readily available as in asia the wolf is more reliant on domestic species
across eurasia wolves prey mostly on moose red deer roe deer and wild boar
in north america important range wide prey are elk moose caribou white tailed deer and mule deer
they also prey on bison and muskoxen
wolves can digest their meal in a few hours and can feed several times in one day making quick use of large quantities of meat
a well fed wolf stores fat under the skin around the heart intestines kidneys and bone marrow particularly during the autumn and winter
nonetheless wolves are not fussy eaters
smaller sized animals that may supplement their diet include rodents rabbits hares insectivores and smaller carnivores
they frequently eat waterfowl and their eggs
when such foods are insufficient they prey on lizards snakes frogs and large insects when available
wolves in northern minnesota prey on northern pike in freshwater streams
the diet of coastal wolves in alaska includes salmon while those of coastal wolves in british columbia includes marine sources and those on the nearby islands
in europe wolves eat apples pears figs melons berries and cherries
in north america wolves eat blueberries and raspberries
wolves also eat grass which may provide some vitamins but is most likely used mainly to induce vomiting to rid themselves of intestinal parasites or long guard hairs
they are known to eat the berries of mountain ash lily of the valley bilberries cowberries european black nightshade grain crops and the shoots of reeds
in times of scarcity wolves will readily eat carrion
in eurasian areas with dense human activity many wolf populations are forced to subsist largely on livestock and garbage
prey in north america continue to occupy suitable habitats with low human density the wolves eating livestock and garbage only in dire circumstances
cannibalism is not uncommon in wolves during harsh winters when packs often attack weak or injured wolves and may eat the bodies of dead pack members
wolves typically dominate other canid species in areas where they both occur
in north america incidents of wolves killing coyotes are common particularly in winter when coyotes feed on wolf kills
wolves may attack coyote den sites digging out and killing their pups though rarely eating them
there are no records of coyotes killing wolves though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber them
according to a press release by the u s
department of agriculture in the infamous custer wolf relied on coyotes to accompany him and warn him of danger
though they fed from his kills he never allowed them to approach him
interactions have been observed in eurasia between wolves and golden jackals the latter s numbers being comparatively small in areas with high wolf densities
wolves also kill red arctic and corsac foxes usually in disputes over carcasses sometimes eating them
brown bears typically dominate wolf packs in disputes over carcasses while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites
both species kill each other s young
wolves eat the brown bears they kill while brown bears seem to eat only young wolves
wolf interactions with american black bears are much rarer because of differences in habitat preferences
wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions actively seeking out american black bears in their dens and killing them without eating them
unlike brown bears american black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills
wolves also dominate and sometimes kill wolverines and will chase off those that attempt to scavenge from their kills
wolverines escape from wolves in caves or up trees
wolves may interact and compete with felids such as the eurasian lynx which may feed on smaller prey where wolves are present and may be suppressed by large wolf populations
wolves encounter cougars along portions of the rocky mountains and adjacent mountain ranges
wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting at different elevations for different prey niche partitioning
in winter when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys interactions between the two species become more likely
wolves in packs usually dominate cougars and can steal their kills or even kill them while one to one encounters tend to be dominated by the cat
there are several documented cases of cougars killing wolves
wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities and disrupting the feline s behaviour
wolf and siberian tiger interactions are well documented in the russian far east where tigers significantly depress wolf numbers sometimes to the point of localized extinction
only human depletion of tiger numbers appears to protect wolves from competitive exclusion from them
with perhaps only four proven records of tigers killing wolves these cases are rare attacks appear to be competitive rather than predatory in nature
in israel central asia and india wolves may encounter striped hyenas usually in disputes over carcasses
striped hyenas feed extensively on wolf killed carcasses in areas where the two species interact
one to one hyenas dominate wolves and may prey on them but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas
there is at least one case in israel of a hyena associating and cooperating with a wolf pack
it is proposed that the hyena could benefit from the wolves superior ability to hunt large agile prey
the wolves could benefit from the hyena s superior sense of smell to locate and dig out tortoises to crack open large bones and to tear open discarded food containers like tin cans
the wolf is a social animal
its populations consist of packs and lone wolves most lone wolves being temporarily alone while they disperse from packs to form their own or join another one
the wolf s basic social unit is the nuclear family consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring
the average pack size in north america is eight wolves and in europe wolves
the average pack across eurasia consists of a family of eight wolves two adults juveniles and yearlings or sometimes two or three such families with examples of exceptionally large packs consisting of up to wolves being known
cortisol levels in wolves rise significantly when a pack member dies indicating the presence of stress
during times of prey abundance caused by calving or migration different wolf packs may join together temporarily
offspring typically stay in the pack for months before dispersing
triggers for dispersal include the onset of sexual maturity and competition within the pack for food
the distance travelled by dispersing wolves varies widely some stay in the vicinity of the parental group while other individuals may travel great distances of upwards of km mi km mi and km mi from their natal birth packs
a new pack is usually founded by an unrelated dispersing male and female travelling together in search of an area devoid of other hostile packs
wolf packs rarely adopt other wolves into their fold and typically kill them
in the rare cases where other wolves are adopted the adoptee is almost invariably an immature animal of one to three years old and unlikely to compete for breeding rights with the mated pair
this usually occurs between the months of february and may
adoptee males may mate with an available pack female and then form their own pack
in some cases a lone wolf is adopted into a pack to replace a deceased breeder
wolves are territorial and generally establish territories far larger than they require to survive assuring a steady supply of prey
territory size depends largely on the amount of prey available and the age of the pack s pups
they tend to increase in size in areas with low prey populations or when the pups reach the age of six months when they have the same nutritional needs as adults
wolf packs travel constantly in search of prey covering roughly of their territory per day on average km d mi d
the core of their territory is on average km sq mi where they spend of their time
prey density tends to be much higher on the territory s periphery
except out of desperation wolves tend to avoid hunting on the fringes of their range to avoid fatal confrontations with neighbouring packs
the smallest territory on record was held by a pack of six wolves in northeastern minnesota which occupied an estimated km sq mi while the largest was held by an alaskan pack of ten wolves encompassing km sq mi
wolf packs are typically settled and usually leave their accustomed ranges only during severe food shortages
territorial fights are among the principal causes of wolf mortality one study concluding that of wolf deaths in minnesota and the denali national park and preserve were due to other wolves
wolves communicate using vocalizations body postures scent touch and taste
the phases of the moon have no effect on wolf vocalization and despite popular belief wolves do not howl at the moon
wolves howl to assemble the pack usually before and after hunts to pass on an alarm particularly at a den site to locate each other during a storm while crossing unfamiliar territory and to communicate across great distances
wolf howls can under certain conditions be heard over areas of up to km sq mi
other vocalizations include growls barks and whines
wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do in confrontations rather barking a few times and then retreating from a perceived danger
aggressive or self assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements high body posture and raised hackles while submissive ones carry their bodies low flatten their fur and lower their ears and tail
scent marking involves urine feces and anal gland scents
this is more effective at advertising territory than howling and is often used in combination with scratch marks
wolves increase their rate of scent marking when they encounter the marks of wolves from other packs
lone wolves will rarely mark but newly bonded pairs will scent mark the most
these marks are generally left every m yd throughout the territory on regular travelways and junctions
such markers can last for two to three weeks and are typically placed near rocks boulders trees or the skeletons of large animals
raised leg urination is considered to be one of the most important forms of scent communication in the wolf making up of all scent marks observed
wolves are monogamous mated pairs usually remaining together for life
should one of the pair die another mate is found quickly
with wolves in the wild inbreeding does not occur where outbreeding is possible
wolves become mature at the age of two years and sexually mature from the age of three years
the age of first breeding in wolves depends largely on environmental factors when food is plentiful or when wolf populations are heavily managed wolves can rear pups at younger ages to better exploit abundant resources
females are capable of producing pups every year one litter annually being the average
oestrus and rut begin in the second half of winter and lasts for two weeks
dens are usually constructed for pups during the summer period
when building dens females make use of natural shelters like fissures in rocks cliffs overhanging riverbanks and holes thickly covered by vegetation
sometimes the den is the appropriated burrow of smaller animals such as foxes badgers or marmots
an appropriated den is often widened and partly remade
on rare occasions female wolves dig burrows themselves which are usually small and short with one to three openings
the den is usually constructed not more than m yd away from a water source
it typically faces southwards where it can be better warmed by sunlight exposure and the snow can thaw more quickly
resting places play areas for the pups and food remains are commonly found around wolf dens
the odor of urine and rotting food emanating from the denning area often attracts scavenging birds like magpies and ravens
though they mostly avoid areas within human sight wolves have been known to nest near domiciles paved roads and railways
during pregnancy female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories where violent encounters with other packs are less likely to occur
the gestation period lasts days with pups usually being born in the spring months or early summer in very cold places such as on the tundra
young females give birth to four to five young and older females from six to eight young and up to
their mortality rate is
newborn wolf pups look similar to german shepherd dog pups
they are born blind and deaf and are covered in short soft grayish brown fur
they weigh g oz at birth and begin to see after nine to days
the milk canines erupt after one month
pups first leave the den after three weeks
at one and a half months of age they are agile enough to flee from danger
mother wolves do not leave the den for the first few weeks relying on the fathers to provide food for them and their young
pups begin to eat solid food at the age of three to four weeks
they have a fast growth rate during their first four months of life during this period a pup s weight can increase nearly times
wolf pups begin play fighting at the age of three weeks though unlike young coyotes and foxes their bites are gentle and controlled
actual fights to establish hierarchy usually occur at five to eight weeks of age
this is in contrast to young coyotes and foxes which may begin fighting even before the onset of play behaviour
by autumn the pups are mature enough to accompany the adults on hunts for large prey
single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs single wolves have occasionally been observed to kill large prey such as moose bison and muskoxen unaided
this contrasts with the commonly held belief that larger packs benefit from cooperative hunting to bring down large game
the size of a wolf hunting pack is related to the number of pups that survived the previous winter adult survival and the rate of dispersing wolves leaving the pack
the optimal pack size for hunting elk is four wolves and for bison a large pack size is more successful
wolves move around their territory when hunting using the same trails for extended periods
after snowfalls wolves find their old trails and continue using them
these follow the banks of rivers the shorelines of lakes ravines overgrown with shrubs plantations or roads and human paths
wolves are nocturnal predators
during the winter a pack will commence hunting in the twilight of early evening and will hunt all night traveling tens of kilometres
sometimes hunting large prey occurs during the day
during the summer wolves generally tend to hunt individually ambushing their prey and rarely giving pursuit
when hunting large gregarious prey wolves will try to isolate an individual from its group
if successful a wolf pack can bring down game that will feed it for days but one error in judgement can lead to serious injury or death
most large prey have developed defensive adaptations and behaviours
wolves have been killed while attempting to bring down bison elk moose muskoxen and even by one of their smallest hoofed prey the white tailed deer
with smaller prey like beaver geese and hares there is no risk to the wolf
although people often believe wolves can easily overcome any of their prey their success rate in hunting hoofed prey is usually low
the wolf must give chase and gain on its fleeing prey slow it down by biting through thick hair and hide and then disable it enough to begin feeding
after chasing and then confronting a large prey animal the wolf makes use of its cm in fangs and its powerful masseter muscles to deliver a bite force of kg cm lbf in which is capable of breaking open the skulls of many of its prey animals
the wolf leaps at its quarry and tears at it
one wolf was observed being dragged for dozens of metres attached to the hind leg of a moose another was seen being dragged over a fallen log while attached to a bull elk s nose
wolves may wound large prey and then lie around resting for hours before killing it when it is weaker due to blood loss thereby lessening the risk of injury to themselves
with medium sized prey such as roe deer or sheep wolves kill by biting the throat severing nerve tracks and the carotid artery thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute
with small mouselike prey wolves leap in a high arc and immobilize it with their forepaws
once prey is brought down wolves begin to feed excitedly ripping and tugging at the carcass in all directions and bolting down large chunks of it
the breeding pair typically monopolizes food to continue producing pups
when food is scarce this is done at the expense of other family members especially non pups
the breeding pair typically eats first
they usually work the hardest at killing prey and may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat undisturbed
once the breeding pair has finished eating the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transports them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace
wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs like the heart liver lungs and stomach lining
the kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed followed by the muscles
a wolf can eat of its body weight in a single feeding
viral diseases carried by wolves include rabies canine distemper canine parvovirus infectious canine hepatitis papillomatosis and canine coronavirus
wolves are a major host for rabies in russia iran afghanistan iraq and india
in wolves the incubation period is eight to days and results in the host becoming agitated deserting its pack and travelling up to km mi a day thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves
infected wolves do not show any fear of humans most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals
although canine distemper is lethal in dogs it has not been recorded to kill wolves except in canada and alaska
the canine parvovirus which causes death by dehydration electrolyte imbalance and endotoxic shock or sepsis is largely survivable in wolves but can be lethal to pups
wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs though there are no records of wolves dying from it
papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves and likely does not cause serious illness or death though it may alter feeding behaviours
the canine coronavirus has been recorded in alaskan wolves infections being most prevalent in winter months
bacterial diseases carried by wolves include brucellosis lyme disease leptospirosis tularemia bovine tuberculosis listeriosis and anthrax
wolves can catch brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer
while adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs it can severely weaken the pups of infected females
although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves it does not appear to significantly affect wolf populations
leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine and can cause fever anorexia vomiting anemia hematuria icterus and death
wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste
wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey though its effect on wolves is unknown
although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves it has been recorded to have killed two wolf pups in canada
wolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites those in the former soviet union have been recorded to carry at least species
most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens
parasitic infection in wolves is of particular concern to people
wolves can spread them to dogs which in turn can carry the parasites to humans
in areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas the parasites can be spread to livestock
wolves are often infested with a variety of arthropod exoparasites including fleas ticks lice and mites
the most harmful to wolves particularly pups is the mange mite sarcoptes scabiei though they rarely develop full blown mange unlike foxes
lice such as trichodectes canis may cause sickness in wolves but rarely death
ticks of the genus ixodes can infect wolves with lyme disease and rocky mountain spotted fever
the tick dermacentor pictus also infests wolves
other ectoparasites include chewing lice sucking lice and the fleas pulex irritans and ctenocephalides canis
endoparasites known to infect wolves include protozoans and helminths flukes tapeworms roundworms and thorny headed worms
of protozoan species only a few have been recorded to infect wolves isospora toxoplasma sarcocystis babesia and giardia
some wolves carry neospora caninum which can be spread to cattle and is correlated with bovine miscarriages
among flukes the most common in north american wolves is alaria which infects small rodents and amphibians which are eaten by wolves
upon reaching maturity alaria migrates to the wolf s intestine but does little harm
metorchis conjunctus which enters wolves through eating fish infects the wolf s liver or gall bladder causing liver disease inflammation of the pancreas and emaciation
most other fluke species reside in the wolf s intestine though paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs
tapeworms are commonly found in wolves as their primary hosts are ungulates small mammals and fish which wolves feed upon
tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves though this depends on the number and size of the parasites and the sensitivity of the host
symptoms often include constipation toxic and allergic reactions irritation of the intestinal mucosa and malnutrition
infections by the tapeworm echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities as wolves can shed echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas
wolves can carry over roundworm species though most roundworm infections appear benign depending on the number of worms and the age of the host
ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host s blood and can cause hyperchromic anemia emaciation diarrhea and possibly death
toxocara canis a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in the uterus can cause intestinal irritation bloating vomiting and diarrhea
wolves may catch dioctophyma renale from minks which infects the kidneys and can grow to lengths of cm in
renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney s functional tissue and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected
wolves can tolerate low levels of dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy
wolves probably become infected with trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates
although t
spiralis is not known to produce clinical signs in wolves it can cause emaciation salivation and crippling muscle pains in dogs
thorny headed worms rarely infect wolves though three species have been identified in russian wolves nicolla skrjabini macracanthorhynchus catulinus and moniliformis moniliformis
the global wild wolf population in was estimated at
wolf population declines have been arrested since the s
this has fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range as a result of legal protection changes in land use and rural human population shifts to cities
competition with humans for livestock and game species concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the wolf
despite these threats the iucn classifies the wolf as least concern on its red list due to its relatively widespread range and stable population
the species is listed under appendix ii of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites meaning international trade in the species including parts and derivatives is regulated
however populations of bhutan india nepal and pakistan are listed in appendix i which prohibits commercial international trade in wild sourced specimens
in canada wolves live in of their historical range making canada an important stronghold for the species
under canadian law first nations people can hunt wolves without restrictions but others must acquire licenses for the hunting and trapping seasons
as many as wolves may be harvested in canada each year
the wolf is a protected species in national parks under the canada national parks act
in alaska wolves are found on of the state s km sq mi area
wolves may be hunted or trapped with a license around wolves are harvested annually
in the contiguous united states wolf declines were caused by the expansion of agriculture the decimation of the wolf s main prey species like the american bison and extermination campaigns
wolves were given protection under the endangered species act esa of and have since returned to parts of their former range thanks to both natural recolonizations and reintroductions in yellowstone and idaho

wolves have been persecuted in europe for centuries having been exterminated in great britain by in ireland by in central europe by in france by the s and in much of scandinavia by the early s
they continued to survive in parts of finland eastern europe and southern europe
since european wolves have rebounded and expanded into parts of their former range
the decline of the traditional pastoral and rural economies seems to have ended the need to exterminate the wolf in parts of europe
as of estimates of wolf numbers include in the balkans in the carpathian mountains in the baltic states in the italian peninsula and around in the northwest iberian peninsula as of
in the former soviet union wolf populations have retained much of their historical range despite soviet era large scale extermination campaigns
their numbers range from in georgia to in kazakhstan and up to in russia
in russia the wolf is regarded as a pest because of its attacks on livestock and wolf management means controlling their numbers by destroying them throughout the year
russian history over the past century shows that reduced hunting leads to an abundance of wolves
the russian government has continued to pay bounties for wolves and annual harvests of do not appear to significantly affect their numbers

in tantric buddhism wolves are depicted as inhabitants of graveyards and destroyers of corpses
in the pawnee creation myth the wolf was the first animal brought to earth
when humans killed it they were punished with death destruction and the loss of immortality
for the pawnee sirius is the wolf star and its disappearance and reappearance signified the wolf moving to and from the spirit world
both pawnee and blackfoot call the milky way the wolf trail
the wolf is also an important crest symbol for clans of the pacific northwest like the kwakwaka wakw
the concept of people turning into wolves and the inverse has been present in many cultures
one greek myth tells of lycaon being transformed into a wolf by zeus as punishment for his evil deeds
the legend of the werewolf has been widespread in european folklore and involves people willingly turning into wolves to attack and kill others
the navajo have traditionally believed that witches would turn into wolves by donning wolf skins and would kill people and raid graveyards
the dena ina believed wolves were once men and viewed them as brothers
aesop featured wolves in several of his fables playing on the concerns of ancient greece s settled sheep herding world
his most famous is the fable of the boy who cried wolf which is directed at those who knowingly raise false alarms and from which the idiomatic phrase to cry wolf is derived
some of his other fables concentrate on maintaining the trust between shepherds and guard dogs in their vigilance against wolves as well as anxieties over the close relationship between wolves and dogs
although aesop used wolves to warn criticize and moralize about human behaviour his portrayals added to the wolf s image as a deceitful and dangerous animal
the bible uses an image of a wolf lying with a lamb in a utopian vision of the future
in the new testament jesus is said to have used wolves as illustrations of the dangers his followers whom he represents as sheep would face should they follow him
isengrim the wolf a character first appearing in the th century latin poem ysengrimus is a major character in the reynard cycle where he stands for the low nobility whilst his adversary reynard the fox represents the peasant hero
isengrim is forever the victim of reynard s wit and cruelty often dying at the end of each story
the tale of little red riding hood first written in by charles perrault is considered to have further contributed to the wolf s negative reputation in the western world
the big bad wolf is portrayed as a villain capable of imitating human speech and disguising itself with human clothing
the character has been interpreted as an allegorical sexual predator
villainous wolf characters also appear in the three little pigs and the wolf and the seven young goats
the hunting of wolves and their attacks on humans and livestock feature prominently in russian literature and are included in the works of leo tolstoy anton chekhov nikolay nekrasov ivan bunin leonid pavlovich sabaneyev and others
tolstoy s war and peace and chekhov s peasants both feature scenes in which wolves are hunted with hounds and borzois
the musical peter and the wolf involves a wolf being captured for eating a duck but is spared and sent to a zoo
wolves are among the central characters of rudyard kipling s the jungle book
his portrayal of wolves has been praised posthumously by wolf biologists for his depiction of them rather than being villainous or gluttonous as was common in wolf portrayals at the time of the book s publication they are shown as living in amiable family groups and drawing on the experience of infirm but experienced elder pack members
farley mowat s largely fictional memoir never cry wolf is widely considered to be the most popular book on wolves having been adapted into a hollywood film and taught in several schools decades after its publication
although credited with having changed popular perceptions on wolves by portraying them as loving cooperative and noble it has been criticized for its idealization of wolves and its factual inaccuracies
human presence appears to stress wolves as seen by increased cortisol levels in instances such as snowmobiling near their territory
livestock depredation has been one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation
as well as causing economic losses the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found
some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programs or state insurance
domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves as they have been bred under constant human protection and are thus unable to defend themselves very well
wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted
in eurasia a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock while such incidents are rare in north america where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored
the majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation
the most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep europe domestic reindeer northern scandinavia goats india horses mongolia cattle and turkeys north america
the number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death while turkeys sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus
wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures
a review of the studies on the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves
competition would favour the wolf which is known to kill dogs however wolves usually live in pairs or in small packs in areas with high human persecution giving them a disadvantage when facing large groups of dogs
wolves kill dogs on occasion and some wolf populations rely on dogs as an important food source
in croatia wolves kill more dogs than sheep and wolves in russia appear to limit stray dog populations
wolves may display unusually bold behaviour when attacking dogs accompanied by people sometimes ignoring nearby humans
wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests
wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in scandinavia and wisconsin
the most frequently killed hunting breeds in scandinavia are harriers older animals being most at risk likely because they are less timid than younger animals and react to the presence of wolves differently
large hunting dogs such as swedish elkhounds are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves
although the number of dogs killed each year by wolves is relatively low it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to prey on them
in many cultures dogs are seen as family members or at least working team members and losing one can lead to strong emotional responses such as demanding more liberal hunting regulations
dogs that are employed to guard sheep help to mitigate human wolf conflicts and are often proposed as one of the non lethal tools in the conservation of wolves
shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviours such as barking social greeting invitation to play or aggression
the historical use of shepherd dogs across eurasia has been effective against wolf predation especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock guardian dogs
shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves
the fear of wolves has been pervasive in many societies though humans are not part of the wolf s natural prey
how wolves react to humans depends largely on their prior experience with people wolves lacking any negative experience of humans or which are food conditioned may show little fear of people
although wolves may react aggressively when provoked such attacks are mostly limited to quick bites on extremities and the attacks are not pressed
predatory attacks may be preceded by a long period of habituation in which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans
the victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face and are then dragged off and consumed unless the wolves are driven off
such attacks typically occur only locally and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated
predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year with a peak in the june august period when the chances of people entering forested areas for livestock grazing or berry and mushroom picking increase
cases of non rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in belarus kirov and irkutsk oblasts karelia and ukraine
also wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period
the majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of and in the rare cases where adults are killed the victims are almost always women
indian wolves have a history of preying on children a phenomenon called child lifting
they may be taken primarily in the spring and summer periods during the evening hours and often within human settlements
cases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease but can be infected by animals such as dogs jackals and foxes
incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in north america though numerous in the eastern mediterranean the middle east and central asia
wolves apparently develop the furious phase of rabies to a very high degree
this coupled with their size and strength makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals
bites from rabid wolves are times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs
rabid wolves usually act alone travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals
most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods
unlike with predatory attacks the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten and the attacks generally occur only on a single day
the victims are chosen at random though most cases involve adult men
during the fifty years up to there were eight fatal attacks in europe and russia and more than two hundred in southern asia
theodore roosevelt said wolves are difficult to hunt because of their elusiveness sharp senses high endurance and ability to quickly incapacitate and kill a dog
historic methods included killing of spring born litters in their dens coursing with dogs usually combinations of sighthounds bloodhounds and fox terriers poisoning with strychnine and trapping
a popular method of wolf hunting in russia involves trapping a pack within a small area by encircling it with fladry poles carrying a human scent
this method relies heavily on the wolf s fear of human scents though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the odor
some hunters can lure wolves by imitating their calls
in kazakhstan and mongolia wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons though this practice is declining as experienced falconers are becoming few in number
shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective due to increased visibility and direct lines of fire
several types of dog including the borzoi and kyrgyz tajgan have been specifically bred for wolf hunting
wolves and wolf dog hybrids are sometimes kept as exotic pets
although closely related to domestic dogs wolves do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside humans being generally less responsive to human commands and more likely to act aggressively
a person is more likely to be fatally mauled by a pet wolf or wolf dog hybrid than by a dog
