the roman missal latin missale romanum is the title of several missals used in the celebration of the roman rite
along with other liturgical books of the roman rite the roman missal contains the texts and rubrics for the celebration of the most common liturgy and mass of the catholic church
before the high middle ages several books were used at mass a sacramentary with the prayers one or more books for the scriptural readings and one or more books for the antiphons and other chants
gradually manuscripts came into being that incorporated parts of more than one of these books leading finally to versions that were complete in themselves
such a book was referred to as a missale plenum english full missal
in saint francis of assisi instructed his friars to adopt the form that was in use at the papal court rule chapter
they adapted this missal further to the needs of their largely itinerant apostolate
pope gregory ix considered but did not put into effect the idea of extending this missal as revised by the franciscans to the whole western church and in pope nicholas iii ordered it to be accepted in all churches in the city of rome
its use spread throughout europe especially after the invention of the printing press but the editors introduced variations of their own choosing some of them substantial
printing also favoured the spread of other liturgical texts of less certain orthodoxy
the council of trent determined that an end must be put to the resulting disparities
the first printed missale romanum roman missal containing the ordo missalis secundum consuetudinem curiae romanae order of the missal in accordance with the custom of the roman curia was produced in milan in
almost a whole century passed before the appearance of an edition officially published by order of the holy see
during that interval the milanese edition was followed by at least other editions printed in venice in paris in lyon
for lack of a controlling authority these editions differ sometimes considerably
annotations in the hand of cardinal gugliemo sirleto in a copy of the venetian edition show that it was used for drawing up the official edition of pope pius v
in substance this text is identical with that of the milanese edition
implementing the decision of the council of trent pope pius v promulgated in the apostolic constitution quo primum of july an edition of the roman missal that was to be in obligatory use throughout the latin church except where there was another liturgical rite that could be proven to have been in use for at least two centuries
some corrections to pope pius v s text proved necessary and pope clement viii replaced it with a new typical edition of the roman missal on july
in this context the word typical means that the text is the one to which all other printings must conform a further revised typical edition was promulgated by pope urban viii on september
beginning in the late seventeenth century france and neighbouring areas saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops influenced by jansenism and gallicanism
this ended when bishop pierre louis parisis of langres and abbot gu ranger initiated in the nineteenth century a campaign to return to the roman missal
pope leo xiii then took the opportunity to issue in a new typical edition that took account of all the changes introduced since the time of pope urban viii
pope pius x also undertook a revision of the roman missal which was published and declared typical by his successor pope benedict xv on july
though pope pius x s revision made few corrections omissions and additions to the text of the prayers in the roman missal there were major changes in the rubrics changes which were not incorporated in the section entitled rubricae generales but were instead printed as an additional section under the heading additiones et variationes in rubricis missalis
in contrast the revision by pope pius xii though limited to the liturgy of only five days of the church s year was much bolder requiring changes even to canon law which until then had prescribed that with the exception of midnight mass for christmas mass should not begin more than one hour before dawn or later than one hour after midday
in the part of the missal thus thoroughly revised he anticipated some of the changes affecting all days of the year after the second vatican council
these novelties included the first official introduction of the vernacular language into the liturgy for renewal of baptismal promises within the easter vigil celebration
pope pius xii issued no new typical edition of the roman missal but authorized printers to replace the earlier texts for palm sunday holy thursday good friday and the easter vigil with those that he began to introduce in and that he made universally obligatory in
the pope also removed from the vigil of pentecost the series of six old testament readings with their accompanying tracts and collects but these continued to be printed until
acceding to the wishes of many of the bishops pope pius xii judged it expedient also to reduce the rubrics of the missal to a simpler form a simplification enacted by a decree of the sacred congregation of rites of march
the changes this made in the general roman calendar are indicated in general roman calendar of pope pius xii
in the following year while preparatory studies were being conducted for a general liturgical reform pope pius xii surveyed the opinions of the bishops on the liturgical improvement of the roman breviary
after duly weighing the answers of the bishops he judged that it was time to address the need for a general and systematic revision of the rubrics of the breviary and missal
this question he referred to the special committee of experts appointed to study the general liturgical reform
his successor pope john xxiii issued a new typical edition of the roman missal in
this incorporated the revised code of rubrics which pope pius xii s commission had prepared and which pope john xxiii had made obligatory with effect from january
in the missal this code of rubrics replaced two of the documents in the edition and the pope s motu proprio rubricarum instructum took the place of the superseded apostolic constitution divino afflatu of pope pius x
other notable revisions were the omission of the adjective perfidis in the good friday prayer for the jews and the insertion of the name of saint joseph into the canon or eucharistic prayer of the mass
in and some changes were officially introduced into the mass of the roman rite in the wake of sacrosanctum concilium but no new edition of the roman missal had been produced to incorporate them
they were reflected in the provisional vernacular translations produced in various countries when the language of the people began to be used in addition to latin
references sometimes met in an english language context to the missal concern these temporary vernacular productions not the roman missal itself
some countries that had the same language used different translations and varied in the amount of vernacular admitted
a new edition of the roman missal was promulgated by pope paul vi with the apostolic constitution missale romanum of april
the full text of the revised missal was not published until the following year and full vernacular translations appeared some years later but parts of the missal in latin were already available since in non definitive form and provisional translations appeared without delay
in his apostolic constitution pope paul made particular mention of the following significant changes that he had made in the roman missal
to the single eucharistic prayer of the previous edition which with minor alterations was preserved as the first eucharistic prayer or roman canon he added three alternative eucharistic prayers increasing also the number of prefaces
the rites of the order of mass in latin ordo missae that is the largely unvarying part of the liturgy were simplified while due care is taken to preserve their substance elements which with the passage of time came to be duplicated or were added with but little advantage were eliminated especially in the rites for the preparation of the bread and wine the breaking of the bread and communion
other elements which have suffered injury through accidents of history are now to be restored to the earlier norm of the holy fathers sacrosanctum concilium art
for example the homily see sacrosanctum concilium art
and the common prayer or prayer of the faithful see sacrosanctum concilium art
paul vi also added the option of a penitential rite or act of reconciliation with god and the brothers at the beginning of the mass though this was neither an ancient part of the introductory rite nor mentioned in sacrosanctum concilium
he greatly increased the proportion of the bible read at mass
even before pius xii reduced the proportion further only of the old testament and of the new testament was read at mass
in pope paul s revision of the old testament and of the new testament are read
he was able to do this by having more readings at mass and introducing a three year cycle of readings on sundays and a two year cycle on weekdays in addition to these changes the pope noted that his revision considerably modified other sections of the missal such as the proper of seasons the proper of saints the common of saints the ritual masses and the votive masses adding in all of these changes particular care has been taken with the prayers not only has their number been increased so that the new texts might better correspond to new needs but also their text has been restored on the testimony of the most ancient evidences
in the first typical edition of the roman missal in latin bearing the title missale romanum ex decreto sacrosancti oecumenici concilii vaticani ii instauratum was published after being formally promulgated by pope paul vi in the previous year
a reprint that corrected misprints appeared in
a second typical edition with minor changes followed in
in pope john paul ii approved a third typical edition which appeared in
this third edition added feasts especially of some recently canonized saints new prefaces of the eucharistic prayers and additional masses and prayers for various needs and it revised and amplified the general instruction of the roman missal
in under pope benedict xvi an emended reprint of the third edition was issued correcting misprints and some other mistakes such as the insertion at the beginning of the apostles creed of unum as in the nicene creed
a supplement gives celebrations such as that of saint pio of pietrelcina added to the general roman calendar after the initial printing of the typical edition
three alterations required personal approval by pope benedict xvi
a change in the order in which a bishop celebrating mass outside his own diocese mentions the local bishop and himself
omission from the roman missal of the special eucharistic prayers for masses with children which were not thereby abolished
the addition of three alternatives to the standard dismissal at the end of mass ite missa est go forth the mass is ended
ite ad evangelium domini annuntiandum go and announce the gospel of the lord
ite in pace glorificando vita vestra dominum go in peace glorifying the lord by your life
ite in pace go in peace pope john xxiii s edition of the roman missal began a period of aesthetic preference for a reduced number of illustrations in black and white instead of the many brightly coloured pictures previously included
the first post vatican ii editions both in the original latin and in translation continued that tendency
the first latin edition had in all black and white woodcut illustrations by gian luigi uboldi
the english translation adopted by the united states episcopal conference appear in several printings
our sunday visitor printed it with further illustrations by uboldi while the printing by catholic book publishing had woodcuts in colour
the german editions of and had no illustrations thus emphasizing the clarity and beauty of the typography
the french editions of and were also without illustrations while the italian editions of and contained both reproductions of miniatures in an th century manuscript and stylized figures whose appropriateness is doubted by the author of a study on the subject who also makes a similar observation about the illustrations in the spanish editions of and
the minimalist presentation in these editions contrasts strongly with the opulence of united states editions of the period between and with their many full colour reproductions of paintings and other works of art
the first vernacular version of the third edition of the vatican ii roman missal to be published was that in greek
it appeared in
the english translation
taking into account the changes came into use in
translations into some other languages took longer that into italian was decided on by the episcopal conference of italy at its november meeting and was confirmed by the holy see in the following year as announced by the conference s president at its may meeting
it replaces the italian translation of the second latin edition
the new text includes changes to the italian lord s prayer and gloria
in the lord s prayer e non c indurre in tentazione and lead us not into temptation becomes non abbandonarci alla tentazione do not abandon us to temptation and come noi li rimettiamo ai nostri debitori as we forgive our debtors becomes come anche noi li rimettiamo ai nostri debitori as we too forgive our debtors
in the gloria pace in terra agli uomini di buona volont peace on earth to people of good will becomes pace in terra agli uomini amati dal signore peace on earth to people who are loved by the lord
in his motu proprio summorum pontificum of july pope benedict xvi stated that the edition of the roman missal was never juridically abrogated and that it may be freely used by any priest of the latin church when celebrating mass without a congregation
use of the edition at mass with a congregation is allowed with the permission of the priest in charge of a church for stable groups attached to this earlier form of the roman rite provided that the priest using it is qualified to do so and not juridically impeded as for instance by suspension
accordingly many dioceses schedule regular masses celebrated using the edition which is also used habitually by priests of traditionalist fraternities in full communion with the holy see such as the priestly fraternity of st
peter the institute of christ the king sovereign priest the personal apostolic administration of saint john mary vianney the canons regular of saint john cantius and the canons regular of the mother of god in lagrasse france
since the main difference between the missal and prior editions is the liturgy for holy week the church has permitted tridentine mass parishes to adopt earlier editions of the roman missal published just prior to the edition
in july pope francis abrogated portions of summorum pontificum with the motu proprio traditionis custodes which established the new circumstances for celebration of the roman missal
groups in dispute with the holy see such as the priestly fraternity of st
pius x and the congregation of mary immaculate queen have continued to use or earlier editions at their own discretion

the international commission on english in the liturgy icel prepared an english translation of the roman missal which was approved by the individual english speaking episcopal conferences and after being reviewed by the holy see was put into effect beginning with the united states in
the authority for the episcopal conferences with the consent of the holy see to decide on such translations was granted by the second vatican council
icel prepared a greatly altered english translation and presented it for the consent of the holy see in
the holy see withheld its consent and informed icel that the latin text of the missal which must be the basis of translations into other languages was being revised making irrelevant a translation based on what would no longer be the official text of the roman missal
on march the holy see issued the instruction liturgiam authenticam which included the requirement that in translations of the liturgical texts from the official latin originals the original text insofar as possible must be translated integrally and in the most exact manner without omissions or additions in terms of their content and without paraphrases or glosses
any adaptation to the characteristics or the nature of the various vernacular languages is to be sober and discreet this was a departure from the principle of functional equivalence promoted in icel translations after the second vatican council
in the following year the third typical edition of the revised roman missal in latin which had already been promulgated in was released
these two texts made clear the need for a new official english translation of the roman missal particularly because the previous one was at some points an adaptation rather than strictly a translation
an example is the rendering of the response et cum spiritu tuo literally and with your spirit as and also with you accordingly the international commission on english in the liturgy prepared with some hesitancy on the part of the bishops a new english translation of the roman missal the completed form of which received the approval of the holy see in april
on july the congregation for divine worship and the discipline of the sacraments established an international committee of english speaking bishops called the vox clara committee to advise that dicastery in its responsibilities related to the translation of liturgical texts in the english language and to strengthen effective cooperation with the conferences of bishops
on the occasion of the meeting of the committee in rome in april pope john paul ii sent them a message emphasizing that fidelity to the rites and texts of the liturgy is of paramount importance for the church and christian life and charging the committee to ensure that the texts of the roman rite are accurately translated in accordance with the norms of the instruction liturgiam authenticam
liturgiam authenticam also took from the bishops conferences the power to make its own translations and instituted a papal commission vox clara to revise the bishops work
in it made an estimated changes to the icel s proposed text
by pope francis had formed a commission to review and evaluate liturgiam authenticam
the work of making a new translation of the roman missal was completed in time to enable the national episcopal conference in most english speaking countries to put it into use from the first sunday of advent november
as well as translating et cum spiritu tuo as and with your spirit which some scholars suggest refers to the gift of the holy spirit the priest received at ordination in the niceno constantinopolitan creed consubstantial with the father was used as a translation of consubstantialem patri in greek instead of of one being with the father or in the united states only one in being with the father and the latin phrase qui pro vobis et pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum formerly translated as it will be shed for you and for all so that sins may be forgiven was translated literally as which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins see pro multis
this new official translation of the entire order of mass is available on the website of the united states conference of catholic bishops which also provides a comparison between the new text of the people s parts and that hitherto in use in the united states where the version of the nicene creed was slightly different from that in other english speaking countries
pope benedict xvi remarked many will find it hard to adjust to unfamiliar texts after nearly forty years of continuous use of the previous translation
the change will need to be introduced with due sensitivity and the opportunity for catechesis that it presents will need to be firmly grasped
i pray that in this way any risk of confusion or bewilderment will be averted and the change will serve instead as a springboard for a renewal and a deepening of eucharistic devotion all over the english speaking world
the plan to introduce the new english translation of the missal was not without critics
over electronic signatures some of them anonymous were collected on a web petition to ask the bishops cardinals and the pope to reconsider the new translation
at the time there was open dissent from one parish in seattle
the southern african catholic bishops conference botswana south africa swaziland put into effect the changes in the people s parts of the revised english translation of the order of mass from november when the missal as a whole was not yet available
protests were voiced on grounds of content and because it meant that southern africa was thus out of line with other english speaking countries
one bishop claimed that the english speaking conferences should have withstood the holy see s insistence on a more literal translation
however when in february the holy see declared that the change should have awaited completion of work on the missal the bishops conference appealed with the result that those parishes that had adopted the new translation were directed to continue using it while those that had not were told to await further instructions before doing so
in view of the foreseen opposition to making changes the various english speaking episcopal conferences arranged catechesis on the mass and the missal and made information available also on the internet
other initiatives included the catholic news agency publishing a series of ten articles on the revised translation
on september pope francis issued the motu proprio magnum principium the great principle which allowed local bishops conferences more authority over translation of liturgical documents
the motu proprio grants the episcopal conferences the faculty to judge the worth and coherence of one or another phrase in the translations from the original the role of the vatican is also modified in accord with the decree of vatican ii to confirming texts already prepared by bishops conferences rather than recognition in the strict sense of canon law no
