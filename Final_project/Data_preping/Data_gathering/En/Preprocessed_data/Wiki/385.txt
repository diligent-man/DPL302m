meanwhile altan khan chief mongol tribe near china's border heard sonam gyatso's spiritual prowess repeatedly invited mongolia
altan khan received title shunyi wang king ming dynasty china swore allegiance ming although remained de facto quite independent fulfilled political destiny nephew advised seek spiritual salvation saying tibet dwells avalokiteshvara referring sonam gyatso year old

lifetime year accomplishment impressive important one due relationship altan khan
wa dying mongolian convert urged leave needed continuing religious leadership
fourth dalai lama yonten gyatso wa mongolian great-grandson altan khan wa descendant kublai khan king tmed mongol already converted buddhism third dalai lama sonam gyatso
strong connection caused mongol zealously support gelugpa sect tibet strengthening status position also arousing intensified opposition gelugpa's rival particularly tsang karma kagyu shigatse mongolian patron bnpo kham allies
newest school unlike older school gelugpa lacked established network tibetan clan patronage thus reliant foreign patrons
age large mongol escort travelled lhasa wa enthroned
studied drepung became abbot non-tibetan met opposition tibetan especially karma kagyu felt position wa threatened emerging event several attempt remove power
yonten gyatso died age suspicious circumstance chief attendant sonam rapten went discover dalai lama became chagdzo manager went regent desi
death fourth dalai lama led open conflict breaking various parties
firstly tsangpa dynasty ruler central tibet shigatse supporter karmapa school rival gelugpa forbade search incarnation
however sonam rabten former attendant dalai lama become ganden phodrang treasurer secretly identified child born noble zahor family tagtse castle south lhasa
panchen lama shigatse negotiated lifting ban enabling boy recognised lobsang gyatso dalai lama
also tsangpa king karma puntsok namgyal whose mongol patron wa choghtu khong tayiji khalkha mongol attacked gelugpa lhasa avenge earlier snub established two military base control monastery city
caused sonam rabten became dalai lama's changdzo manager seek active mongol patronage military assistance gelugpa fifth wa still boy
mongol troop allied gelugpa camped outside lhasa suddenly attacked destroyed two tsangpa camp drove lhasa enabling dalai lama brought hiding publicly enthroned in
fact throughout 's minority wa influential forceful sonam rabten inspired dzungar mongol defend gelugpa attacking enemies
enemy included mongol tribe supported tsangpas tsangpa bnpo ally kham also opposed persecuted gelugpas
ultimately strategy led destruction tsangpa dynasty defeat karmapas ally bnpos armed force lhasa valley aided mongol ally paving way gelugpa political religious hegemony central tibet
apparently general consensus virtue position dalai lama's changdzo chief attendant minister dalai lama became absolute ruler tibet sonam rabten became desi viceroy fact de facto regent day-to-day ruler tibet's governmental affairs
year rest life died wa little doubt politically sonam chophel rabten wa powerful dalai lama
young man year junior dalai lama addressed reverentially zhalngo meaning presence
tibet wa deeply entangled rivalry evolving power struggle conflict tibetan religious sect also rising manchu various rival mongol oirat faction also vying supremacy amongst behalf religious sect patronised
example ligdan khan chahars mongol subgroup supported tsang karmapas retreating advancing manchu army headed kokonor intending destroy gelug
died way vassal choghtu khong tayiji continued advance gelugpas even son arslan killed arslan changed side submitted dalai lama become gelugpa monk
mid-s thanks effort sonam rabten dalai lama found powerful new patron gshi khan khoshut mongol subgroup dzungars recently migrated kokonor area dzungaria
attacked choghtu khong tayiji kokonor defeated killed thus eliminating tsangpa karmapa's main mongol patron protector
next donyo dorje bnpo king beri kham wa found writing tsangpa king shigatse propose co-ordinated 'pincer attack' lhasa gelugpa monastery east west seeking utterly destroy all
intercepted letter wa sent gshi khan used pretext invade central tibet attack bnpo tsangpa
defeated donyo dorje ally kham marched shigatse laying siege stronghold defeated karma tenkyong broke power tsang karma kagyu ended tsangpa dynasty
gshi khan's attack tsangpa wa made order sonam rapten publicly robustly opposed dalai lama matter conscience compassion vision tolerance religious school refused give permission warfare name defeat beri king
sonam rabten deviously went behind master's back encourage gshi khan facilitate plan ensure attack took place defiance master's wish rabten wa severely rebuked dalai lama
desi sonam rapten died following year dalai lama appointed younger brother depa norbu aka nangso norbu successor
however month norbu betrayed led rebellion ganden phodrang government
accomplice seized samdruptse fort shigatse tried raise rebel army tsang bhutan dalai lama skilfully foiled plan without fighting taking place norbu flee
four desis appointed depa norbu trinle gyatso lozang tutop lozang jinpa sangye gyatso
thus defeated gelugpa's rival resolved regional sectarian conflict gshi khan became undisputed patron unified tibet acted protector gelug establishing khoshut khanate covered almost entire tibetan plateau area corresponding roughly 'greater tibet' including kham amdo claimed exiled group see maps
enthronement ceremony shigatse conferred full sovereignty tibet fifth dalai lama unified first time since collapse tibetan empire exactly eight century earlier
gshi khan retired kokonor army according smith ruled amdo directly thus creating precedent later separation amdo rest tibet
way gshi khan established fifth dalai lama highest spiritual political authority tibet
'the great fifth' became temporal ruler tibet rule dalai lama lineage tibet lasted break next year dalai lama fled india
gshi khan died wa succeeded descendant dayan tenzin dalai khan tenzin wangchuk khan
however gshi khan's eight son settled amdo fought amongst territory fifth dalai lama sent governor rule thereby bringing amdo thus whole greater tibet personal rule gelugpa control
manchu proclaimed dynasty qing dynasty completed conquest china prince regent dorgon
following year force approached amdo northern tibet causing oirat khoshut mongol submit send tribute
quelling rebellion tibetan kansu-xining qing invited fifth dalai lama visit court beijing since wished engender tibetan influence dealing mongols
qing aware dalai lama extraordinary influence mongol saw relation dalai lama mean facilitate submission khalka mongol traditional patron karma kagyu sect
similarly since tibetan gelugpa keen revive priest-patron relationship dominant power china inner asia qing invitation wa accepted
five year complex diplomatic negotiation whether emperor representative meet dalai lama inside outside great wall meeting would astrologically favourable would conducted eventually took place beijing in
shunzhi emperor wa year old meantime ascended throne death dorgon
qing although dalai lama wa required kowtow emperor rose throne advanced foot meet significance visit wa nominal political submission dalai lama since inner asian head state travel meet sent envoys
tibetan buddhist historian however wa interpreted start era independent rule dalai lama qing patronage alongside mongols
dalai lama returned wa granted emperor china golden seal authority golden sheet text written manchu tibetan chinese languages
dalai lama wanted use golden seal authority right away
however lobzang gyatsho noted tibetan version inscription seal wa translated mongolian translator wa good translation
correction read one resides western peaceful virtuous paradise unalterable vajradhara ocen lama unifier doctrine buddha sky
word diploma ran proclamation let people western hemisphere know
tibetan historian nyima gyaincain point based text written golden sheet dalai lama wa subordinate emperor china
however despite patronising attempt chinese official historian symbolically show record held political influence tibet tibetan accept symbol imposed chinese kind motive
example concerning above-mentioned 'golden seal' fifth dalai lama comment dukula autobiography leaving china courtesy visit emperor emperor made men bring golden seal three vertical line three parallel script chinese mongolian tibetan
also criticised word carved gift faultily translated tibetan writing tibetan version inscription seal wa translated mongol translator wa good translation
furthermore arrived back tibet discarded emperor's famous golden seal made new one important state usage writing autobiography leaving chinese character seal given emperor new seal wa carved stamping document dealt territorial issues
first imprint seal wa offered prayer image lokeshvara
-century struggle domination manchu-led qing dynasty various mongol group spilled involve tibet fifth dalai lama's strong influence mongol result general adoption tibetan buddhism consequent deep loyalty dalai lama guru
fifth dalai lama mediated dzungar mongol affair whenever required kangxi emperor succeeded shunzhi emperor would accept confirm decision automatically
kangxi emperor however alliance dzungar mongol tibetan wa unsettling feared potential unite mongol tribe together qing empire including tribe already submitted
therefore kangxi emperor annoyed fifth's le full cooperation quelling rebellion qing yunnan ceased deferring regard mongol affair started dealing directly
year dalai lama height power conducting foreign policy independent qing caused mongol troop occupy border post dartsedo kham sichuan annoying kangxi emperor according smith already considered tibet part qing empire
