dalai lama uk d la l m us d la l m tibetan wylie t la i bla ma t l l ma is a title given by the tibetan people to the foremost spiritual leader of the gelug or yellow hat school of tibetan buddhism the newest and most dominant of the four major schools of tibetan buddhism
the th and current dalai lama is tenzin gyatso who lives as a refugee in india
the dalai lama is also considered to be the successor in a line of tulkus who are believed to be incarnations of avalokite vara the bodhisattva of compassion
since the time of the th dalai lama in the th century his personage has always been a symbol of unification of the state of tibet where he has represented buddhist values and traditions
the dalai lama was an important figure of the geluk tradition which was politically and numerically dominant in central tibet but his religious authority went beyond sectarian boundaries
while he had no formal or institutional role in any of the religious traditions which were headed by their own high lamas he was a unifying symbol of the tibetan state representing buddhist values and traditions above any specific school
the traditional function of the dalai lama as an ecumenical figure holding together disparate religious and regional groups has been taken up by the fourteenth dalai lama
he has worked to overcome sectarian and other divisions in the exiled community and has become a symbol of tibetan nationhood for tibetans both in tibet and in exile
from until and from to the s the dalai lamas or their regents headed the tibetan government or ganden phodrang in lhasa which governed all or most of the tibetan plateau with varying degrees of autonomy
this tibetan government enjoyed the patronage and protection of firstly mongol kings of the khoshut and dzungar khanates and then of the emperors of the manchu led qing dynasty
in several tibetan representatives including agvan dorzhiev signed a treaty between tibet and mongolia proclaiming mutual recognition and their independence from china however the legitimacy of the treaty and declared independence of tibet was rejected by both the republic of china and the current people s republic of china
the dalai lamas headed the tibetan government afterwards despite that until
the name dalai lama is a combination of the mongolic word dalai meaning ocean or big coming from mongolian title dalaiyin qan or dalaiin khan translated as gyatso or rgya mtsho in tibetan and the tibetan word bla ma meaning master guru
the dalai lama is also known in tibetan as the rgyal ba rin po che precious conqueror or simply as the rgyal ba
in central asian buddhist countries it has been widely believed for the last millennium that avalokite vara the bodhisattva of compassion has a special relationship with the people of tibet and intervenes in their fate by incarnating as benevolent rulers and teachers such as the dalai lamas
this is according to the book of kadam the main text of the kadampa school to which the st dalai lama gendun drup first belonged
in fact this text is said to have laid the foundation for the tibetans later identification of the dalai lamas as incarnations of avalokite vara
it traces the legend of the bodhisattva s incarnations as early tibetan kings and emperors such as songtsen gampo and later as dromt npa
this lineage has been extrapolated by tibetans up to and including the dalai lamas
thus according to such sources an informal line of succession of the present dalai lamas as incarnations of avalokite vara stretches back much further than gendun drub
the book of kadam the compilation of kadampa teachings largely composed around discussions between the indian sage ati a and his tibetan host and chief disciple dromt npa and tales of the previous incarnations of arya avalokite vara nominate as many as sixty persons prior to gendun drub who are enumerated as earlier incarnations of avalokite vara and predecessors in the same lineage leading up to him
in brief these include a mythology of indian personalities plus early tibetan kings and emperors all said to be previous incarnations of dromt npa and fourteen further nepalese and tibetan yogis and sages in between him and the st dalai lama
in fact according to the birth to exile article on the th dalai lama s website he is the seventy fourth in a lineage that can be traced back to a brahmin boy who lived in the time of buddha shakyamuni
according to the th dalai lama long ago avalokite vara had promised the buddha to guide and defend the tibetan people and in the late middle ages his master plan to fulfill this promise was the stage by stage establishment of the dalai lama theocracy in tibet
first tsongkhapa established three great monasteries around lhasa in the province of before he died in
the st dalai lama soon became abbot of the greatest one drepung and developed a large popular power base in
he later extended this to cover tsang where he constructed a fourth great monastery tashi lhunpo at shigatse
the nd studied there before returning to lhasa where he became abbot of drepung
having reactivated the st s large popular followings in tsang and the nd then moved on to southern tibet and gathered more followers there who helped him construct a new monastery chokorgyel
he also established the method by which later dalai lama incarnations would be discovered through visions at the oracle lake lhamo lhatso
the rd built on his predecessors fame by becoming abbot of the two great monasteries of drepung and sera
the stage was set for the great mongol king altan khan hearing of his reputation to invite the rd to mongolia where he converted the king and his followers to buddhism as well as other mongol princes and their followers covering a vast tract of central asia
thus most of mongolia was added to the dalai lama s sphere of influence founding a spiritual empire which largely survives to the modern age
after being given the mongolian name dalai he returned to tibet to found the great monasteries of lithang in kham eastern tibet and kumbum in amdo north eastern tibet
the th was then born in mongolia as the great grandson of altan khan thus cementing strong ties between central asia the dalai lamas the gelugpa and tibet
finally in fulfilment of avalokite vara s master plan the th in the succession used the vast popular power base of devoted followers built up by his four predecessors
by a strategy that was planned and carried out by his resourceful chagdzo or manager sonam rapten with the military assistance of his devoted disciple gushri khan chieftain of the khoshut mongols enabled the great th to found the dalai lamas religious and political reign over more or less the whole of tibet that survived for over years
thus the dalai lamas became pre eminent spiritual leaders in tibet and himalayan and central asian kingdoms and countries bordering tibet and their prolific literary works have for centuries acted as major sources of spiritual and philosophical inspiration to more than fifty million people of these lands
overall they have played a monumental role in asian literary philosophical and religious history
gendun drup a disciple of the founder je tsongkapa was the ordination name of the monk who came to be known as the first dalai lama but only from years after he died
there had been resistance since first he was ordained a monk in the kadampa tradition and for various reasons for hundreds of years the kadampa school had eschewed the adoption of the tulku system to which the older schools adhered
tsongkhapa largely modelled his new reformed gelugpa school on the kadampa tradition and refrained from starting a tulku system
therefore although gendun drup grew to be a very important gelugpa lama after he died in there was no question of any search being made to identify his incarnation
despite this when the tashilhunpo monks started hearing what seemed credible accounts that an incarnation of gendun drup had appeared nearby and repeatedly announced himself from the age of two their curiosity was aroused
it was some years after tsongkhapa s death when eventually the monastic authorities saw compelling evidence that convinced them the child in question was indeed the incarnation of their founder
they felt obliged to break with their own tradition and in the boy was renamed gendun gyatso and installed at tashilhunpo as gendun drup s tulku albeit informally
gendun gyatso died in and the lineage of dalai lama tulkus finally became firmly established when the third incarnation sonam gyatso came forth
he made himself known as the tulku of gendun gyatso and was formally recognised and enthroned at drepung in
when gendun gyatso was given the titular name dalai lama by the t med altan khan in his two predecessors were accorded the title posthumously and he became known as the third in the lineage
the dalai lama lineage started from humble beginnings
pema dorje the boy who was to become the first in the line was born in a cattle pen in shabtod tsang in
his nomad parents kept sheep and goats and lived in tents
when his father died in his mother was unable to support the young goatherd so she entrusted him to his uncle a monk at narthang a major kadampa monastery near shigatse for education as a buddhist monk
narthang ran the largest printing press in tibet and its celebrated library attracted scholars and adepts from far and wide so pema dorje received an education beyond the norm at the time as well as exposure to diverse spiritual schools and ideas
he studied buddhist philosophy extensively and in ordained by narthang s abbot he took the name of gendun drup
soon recognised as an exceptionally gifted pupil the abbot tutored him personally and took special interest in his progress
in years he passed the grades of monkhood and took the highest vows
after completing his intensive studies at narthang he left to continue at specialist monasteries in central tibet his grounding at narthang was revered among many he encountered
in gendun drup met tsongkhapa founder of the gelugpa school and became his student their meeting was of decisive historical and political significance as he was later to be known as the st dalai lama
when eventually tsongkhapa s successor the panchen lama khedrup je died gendun drup became the leader of the gelugpa
he rose to become abbot of drepung the greatest gelugpa monastery outside lhasa
it was mainly due to gendun drup s energy and ability that tsongkhapa s new school grew into an expanding order capable of competing with others on an equal footing
taking advantage of good relations with the nobility and a lack of determined opposition from rival orders on the very edge of karma kagyu dominated territory he founded tashilhunpo monastery at shigatse
he was based there as its abbot from its founding in until his death
tashilhunpo mountain of blessings became the fourth great gelugpa monastery in tibet after ganden drepung and sera had all been founded in tsongkhapa s time
it later became the seat of the panchen lamas
by establishing it at shigatse in the middle of tsang he expanded the gelugpa sphere of influence and his own from the lhasa region of to this province which was the stronghold of the karma kagyu school and their patrons the rising tsangpa dynasty
tashilhunpo was destined to become southern tibet s greatest monastic university with a complement of monks
gendun drup was said to be the greatest scholar saint ever produced by narthang monastery and became the single most important lama in tibet
through hard work he became a leading lama known as perfecter of the monkhood with a host of disciples
famed for his buddhist scholarship he was also referred to as panchen gendun drup panchen being an honorary title designating great scholar
by the great jonangpa master bodong chokley namgyal he was accorded the honorary title tamchey khyenpa meaning the omniscient one an appellation that was later assigned to all dalai lama incarnations
at the age of he entered meditation retreat at narthang
as he grew older karma kagyu adherents finding their sect was losing too many recruits to the monkhood to burgeoning gelugpa monasteries tried to contain gelug expansion by launching military expeditions against them in the region
this led to decades of military and political power struggles between tsangpa dynasty forces and others across central tibet
in an attempt to ameliorate these clashes from his retreat gendun drup issued a poem of advice to his followers advising restraint from responding to violence with more violence and to practice compassion and patience instead
the poem entitled shar gang rima the song of the eastern snow mountains became one of his most enduring popular literary works
although he was born in a cattle pen to be a simple goatherd gendun drup rose to become one of the most celebrated and respected teachers in tibet and central asia
his spiritual accomplishments brought him substantial donations from devotees which he used to build and furnish new monasteries to print and distribute buddhist texts and to maintain monks and meditators
at last at the age of older than any of his successors in he went on foot to visit narthang monastery on a final teaching tour
returning to tashilhunpo he died in a blaze of glory recognised as having attained buddhahood
his mortal remains were interred in a bejewelled silver stupa at tashi lhunpo monastery which survived the cultural revolution and can still be seen
like the kadampa the gelugpa eschewed the tulku system
after gendun drup died however a boy called sangyey pel born to nyngma adepts at yolkar in tsang declared himself at to be gendun drup and asked to be taken home to tashilhunpo
he spoke in mystical verses quoted classical texts out of the blue and said he was dromt npa an earlier incarnation of the dalai lamas
when he saw monks from tashilhunpo he greeted the disciples of the late gendun drup by name
the gelugpa elders had to break with tradition and recognised him as gendun drup s tulku
he was then but until his th year his father took him on his teachings and retreats training him in all the family nyingma lineages
at he was installed at tashilhunpo as gendun drup s incarnation ordained enthroned and renamed gendun gyatso palzangpo
tutored personally by the abbot he made rapid progress and from at he was requested to teach all over tsang where thousands gathered to listen and give obeisance including senior scholars and abbots
in at he met some opposition from the tashilhunpo establishment when tensions arose over conflicts between advocates of the two types of succession the traditional abbatial election through merit and incarnation
although he had served for some years as tashilhunpo s abbot he therefore moved to central tibet where he was invited to drepung and where his reputation as a brilliant young teacher quickly grew
he was accorded all the loyalty and devotion that gendun drup had earned and the gelug school remained as united as ever
this move had the effect of shifting central gelug authority back to lhasa
under his leadership the sect went on growing in size and influence and with its appeal of simplicity devotion and austerity its lamas were asked to mediate in disputes between other rivals
gendun gyatso s popularity in tsang grew as he went on pilgrimage travelling teaching and studying from masters such as the adept khedrup norzang gyatso in the olklha mountains
he also stayed in kongpo and dagpo and became known all over tibet
he spent his winters in lhasa writing commentaries and the rest of the year travelling and teaching many thousands of monks and lay people
in he moved to southern tibet to build chokorgyel monastery near the oracle lake lhamo latso completing it by
that year he saw visions in the lake and empowered it to impart clues to help identify incarnate lamas
all dalai lamas from the rd on were found with the help of such visions granted to regents
by now widely regarded as one of tibet s greatest saints and scholars he was invited back to tashilhunpo
on his return in he was given the residence built for gendun drup to be occupied later by the panchen lamas
he was made abbot of tashilhunpo and stayed there teaching in tsang for months
gendun gyatso continued to travel widely and teach while based at tibet s largest monastery drepung and became known as drepung lama his fame and influence spreading all over central asia as the best students from hundreds of lesser monasteries in asia were sent to drepung for education
throughout gendun gyatso s life the gelugpa were opposed and suppressed by older rivals particularly the karma kagyu and their ringpung clan patrons from tsang who felt threatened by their loss of influence
in the ringpung army captured lhasa and banned the gelugpa annual new year monlam prayer festival started by tsongkhapa for world peace and prosperity
gendun gyatso was promoted to abbot of drepung in and that year ringpung forces were forced to withdraw from lhasa
gendun gyatso then went to the gongma king drakpa jungne to obtain permission for the festival to be held again
the next new year the gongma was so impressed by gendun gyatso s performance leading the festival that he sponsored construction of a large new residence for him at drepung a monastery within a monastery
it was called the ganden phodrang a name later adopted by the tibetan government and it served as home for dalai lamas until the fifth moved to the potala palace in
in already abbot of chokhorgyel drepung and tashilhunpo he was made abbot of sera monastery as well and seeing the number of monks was low he worked to increase it
based at drepung in winter and chokorgyel in summer he spent his remaining years in composing commentaries regional teaching tours visiting tashilhunpo from time to time and acting as abbot of these four great monasteries
as abbot he made drepung the largest monastery in the whole of tibet
he attracted many students and disciples from kashmir to china as well as major patrons and disciples such as gongma nangso donyopa of droda who built a monastery at zhekar dzong in his honour and invited him to name it and be its spiritual guide
gongma gyaltsen palzangpo of khyomorlung at tolung and his queen sangyey paldzomma also became his favourite devoted lay patrons and disciples in the s and he visited their area to carry out rituals as he chose it for his next place of rebirth
he died in meditation at drepung in at and his reliquary stupa was constructed at khyomorlung
it was said that by the time he died through his disciples and their students his personal influence covered the whole of buddhist central asia where there was nobody of any consequence who did not know of him
the third dalai lama sonam gyatso was born in tolung near lhasa
as predicted by his predecessor
claiming he was gendun gyatso and readily recalling events from his previous life he was recognised as the incarnation named sonam gyatso and installed at drepung where he quickly excelled his teachers in knowledge and wisdom and developed extraordinary powers
unlike his predecessors he came from a noble family connected with the sakya and the phagmo drupa karma kagyu affiliated dynasties and it is to him that the effective conversion of mongolia to buddhism is due
a brilliant scholar and teacher he had the spiritual maturity to be made abbot of drepung taking responsibility for the material and spiritual well being of tibet s largest monastery at the age of nine
at he led the monlam prayer festival giving daily discourses to the assembly of all gelugpa monks
his influence grew so quickly that soon the monks at sera monastery also made him their abbot and his mediation was being sought to prevent fighting between political power factions
at in he was invited to nedong by king ngawang tashi drakpa a karma kagyu supporter and became his personal teacher
at when fighting broke out in lhasa between gelug and kagyu parties and efforts by local lamas to mediate failed sonam gyatso negotiated a peaceful settlement
at when the kyichu river burst its banks and flooded lhasa he led his followers to rescue victims and repair the dykes
he then instituted a custom whereby on the last day of monlam all the monks would work on strengthening the flood defences
gradually he was shaping himself into a national leader
his popularity and renown became such that in when the nedong king died it was sonam gyatso at the age of who was requested to lead his funeral rites rather than his own kagyu lamas
required to travel and teach without respite after taking full ordination in he still maintained extensive meditation practices in the hours before dawn and again at the end of the day
in at age he went to tashilhunpo to study the layout and administration of the monastery built by his predecessor gendun drup
invited to become the abbot he declined already being abbot of drepung and sera but left his deputy there in his stead
from there he visited narthang the first monastery of gendun drup and gave numerous discourses and offerings to the monks in gratitude
meanwhile altan khan chief of all the mongol tribes near china s borders had heard of sonam gyatso s spiritual prowess and repeatedly invited him to mongolia
by when altan khan received a title of shunyi wang king from the ming dynasty of china and swore allegiance to ming although he remained de facto quite independent he had fulfilled his political destiny and a nephew advised him to seek spiritual salvation saying that in tibet dwells avalokiteshvara referring to sonam gyatso then years old
china was also happy to help altan khan by providing necessary translations of holy scripture and also lamas
at the second invitation in sonam gyatso travelled miles to mongolia to see him
they met in an atmosphere of intense reverence and devotion and their meeting resulted in the re establishment of strong tibet mongolia relations after a gap of years
to altan khan sonam gyatso identified himself as the incarnation of drog n ch gyal phagpa and altan khan as that of kubilai khan thus placing the khan as heir to the chingizid lineage whilst securing his patronage
altan khan and his followers quickly adopted buddhism as their state religion replacing the prohibited traditional shamanism
mongol law was reformed to accord with tibetan buddhist law
from this time buddhism spread rapidly across mongolia and soon the gelugpa had won the spiritual allegiance of most of the mongolian tribes
as proposed by sonam gyatso altan khan sponsored the building of thegchen chonkhor monastery at the site of sonam gyatso s open air teachings given to the whole mongol population
he also called sonam gyatso dalai mongolian for gyatso ocean
in october as requested by the family of altan khan gyalwa sonam gyatso was promoted to du er zh ch ng chinese by the emperor of china seal of authority and golden sheets were granted
the name dalai lama by which the lineage later became known throughout the non tibetan world was thus established and it was applied to the first two incarnations retrospectively
returning eventually to tibet by a roundabout route and invited to stay and teach all along the way in sonam gyatso was in hohhot or ningxia not far from beijing when the chinese emperor invited him to his court
by then he had established a religious empire of such proportions that it was unsurprising the emperor wanted to invite him and grant him a diploma
at the request of the ningxia governor he had been teaching large gatherings of people from east turkestan mongolia and nearby areas of china with interpreters provided by the governor for each language
while there a ming court envoy came with gifts and a request to visit the wanli emperor but he declined having already agreed to visit eastern tibet next
once there in kham he founded two more great gelugpa monasteries the first in at lithang where he left his representative before going on to chamdo monastery where he resided and was made abbot
through altan khan the rd dalai lama requested to pay tribute to the emperor of china in order to raise his state tutor ranking the ming imperial court of china agreed with the request
in he heard altan khan had died and invited by his son dh ring khan he decided to return to mongolia
passing through amdo he founded a second great monastery kumbum at the birthplace of tsongkhapa near kokonor
further on he was asked to adjudicate on border disputes between mongolia and china
it was the first time a dalai lama had exercised such political authority
arriving in mongolia in he stayed years with dh ring khan teaching buddhism to his people and converting more mongol princes and their tribes
receiving a second invitation from the emperor in beijing he accepted but died en route in
for a lifetime of only years his accomplishments were impressive and some of the most important ones were due to his relationship with altan khan
as he was dying his mongolian converts urged him not to leave them as they needed his continuing religious leadership
he promised them he would be incarnated next in mongolia as a mongolian
the fourth dalai lama yonten gyatso was a mongolian the great grandson of altan khan who was a descendant of kublai khan and king of the t med mongols who had already been converted to buddhism by the third dalai lama sonam gyatso
this strong connection caused the mongols to zealously support the gelugpa sect in tibet strengthening their status and position but also arousing intensified opposition from the gelugpa s rivals particularly the tsang karma kagyu in shigatse and their mongolian patrons and the b npo in kham and their allies
being the newest school unlike the older schools the gelugpa lacked an established network of tibetan clan patronage and were thus more reliant on foreign patrons
at the age of with a large mongol escort he travelled to lhasa where he was enthroned
he studied at drepung and became its abbot but being a non tibetan he met with opposition from some tibetans especially the karma kagyu who felt their position was threatened by these emerging events there were several attempts to remove him from power
yonten gyatso died at the age of under suspicious circumstances and his chief attendant sonam rapten went on to discover the th dalai lama became his chagdzo or manager and after he went on to be his regent the desi
the death of the fourth dalai lama in led to open conflict breaking out between various parties
firstly the tsangpa dynasty rulers of central tibet from shigatse supporters of the karmapa school and rivals to the gelugpa forbade the search for his incarnation
however in sonam rabten the former attendant of the th dalai lama who had become the ganden phodrang treasurer secretly identified the child who had been born to the noble zahor family at tagtse castle south of lhasa
then the panchen lama in shigatse negotiated the lifting of the ban enabling the boy to be recognised as lobsang gyatso the th dalai lama
also in the tsangpa king karma puntsok namgyal whose mongol patron was choghtu khong tayiji of the khalkha mongols attacked the gelugpa in lhasa to avenge an earlier snub and established two military bases there to control the monasteries and the city
this caused sonam rabten who became the th dalai lama s changdzo or manager to seek more active mongol patronage and military assistance for the gelugpa while the fifth was still a boy
so in mongol troops allied to the gelugpa who had camped outside lhasa suddenly attacked and destroyed the two tsangpa camps and drove them out of lhasa enabling the dalai lama to be brought out of hiding and publicly enthroned there in
in fact throughout the th s minority it was the influential and forceful sonam rabten who inspired the dzungar mongols to defend the gelugpa by attacking their enemies
these enemies included other mongol tribes who supported the tsangpas the tsangpa themselves and their b npo allies in kham who had also opposed and persecuted gelugpas
ultimately this strategy led to the destruction of the tsangpa dynasty the defeat of the karmapas and their other allies and the b npos by armed forces from the lhasa valley aided by their mongol allies paving the way for gelugpa political and religious hegemony in central tibet
apparently by general consensus by virtue of his position as the dalai lama s changdzo chief attendant minister after the dalai lama became absolute ruler of tibet in sonam rabten became the desi or viceroy in fact the de facto regent or day to day ruler of tibet s governmental affairs
during these years and for the rest of his life he died in there was little doubt that politically sonam chophel rabten was more powerful than the dalai lama
as a young man being years his junior the dalai lama addressed him reverentially as zhalngo meaning the presence
during the s tibet was deeply entangled in rivalry evolving power struggles and conflicts not only between the tibetan religious sects but also between the rising manchus and the various rival mongol and oirat factions who were also vying for supremacy amongst themselves and on behalf of the religious sects they patronised
for example ligdan khan of the chahars a mongol subgroup who supported the tsang karmapas after retreating from advancing manchu armies headed for kokonor intending destroy the gelug
he died on the way in but his vassal choghtu khong tayiji continued to advance against the gelugpas even having his own son arslan killed after arslan changed sides submitted to the dalai lama and become a gelugpa monk
by the mid s thanks again to the efforts of sonam rabten the th dalai lama had found a powerful new patron in g shi khan of the khoshut mongols a subgroup of the dzungars who had recently migrated to the kokonor area from dzungaria
he attacked choghtu khong tayiji at kokonor in and defeated and killed him thus eliminating the tsangpa and the karmapa s main mongol patron and protector
next donyo dorje the b npo king of beri in kham was found writing to the tsangpa king in shigatse to propose a co ordinated pincer attack on the lhasa gelugpa monasteries from east and west seeking to utterly destroy them once and for all
the intercepted letter was sent to g shi khan who used it as a pretext to invade central tibet in to attack them both the b npo and the tsangpa
by he had defeated donyo dorje and his allies in kham and then he marched on shigatse where after laying siege to their strongholds he defeated karma tenkyong broke the power of the tsang karma kagyu in and ended the tsangpa dynasty
g shi khan s attack on the tsangpa was made on the orders of sonam rapten while being publicly and robustly opposed by the dalai lama who as a matter of conscience out of compassion and his vision of tolerance for other religious schools refused to give permission for more warfare in his name after the defeat of the beri king
sonam rabten deviously went behind his master s back to encourage g shi khan to facilitate his plans and to ensure the attacks took place for this defiance of his master s wishes rabten was severely rebuked by the th dalai lama
after desi sonam rapten died in the following year the th dalai lama appointed his younger brother depa norbu aka nangso norbu as his successor
however after a few months norbu betrayed him and led a rebellion against the ganden phodrang government
with his accomplices he seized samdruptse fort at shigatse and tried to raise a rebel army from tsang and bhutan but the dalai lama skilfully foiled his plans without any fighting taking place and norbu had to flee
four other desis were appointed after depa norbu trinle gyatso lozang tutop lozang jinpa and sangye gyatso
having thus defeated all the gelugpa s rivals and resolved all regional and sectarian conflicts g shi khan became the undisputed patron of a unified tibet and acted as a protector of the gelug establishing the khoshut khanate which covered almost the entire tibetan plateau an area corresponding roughly to greater tibet including kham and amdo as claimed by exiled groups see maps
at an enthronement ceremony in shigatse he conferred full sovereignty over tibet on the fifth dalai lama unified for the first time since the collapse of the tibetan empire exactly eight centuries earlier
g shi khan then retired to kokonor with his armies and according to smith ruled amdo himself directly thus creating a precedent for the later separation of amdo from the rest of tibet
in this way g shi khan established the fifth dalai lama as the highest spiritual and political authority in tibet
the great fifth became the temporal ruler of tibet in and from then on the rule of the dalai lama lineage over some all or most of tibet lasted with few breaks for the next years until when the th dalai lama fled to india
in the great fifth began the construction of the potala palace in lhasa
g shi khan died in and was succeeded by his descendants dayan tenzin dalai khan and tenzin wangchuk khan
however g shi khan s other eight sons had settled in amdo but fought amongst themselves over territory so the fifth dalai lama sent governors to rule them in and thereby bringing amdo and thus the whole of greater tibet under his personal rule and gelugpa control
the mongols in amdo became absorbed and tibetanised
in the manchus proclaimed their dynasty as the qing dynasty and by they had completed their conquest of china under the prince regent dorgon
the following year their forces approached amdo on northern tibet causing the oirat and khoshut mongols there to submit in and send tribute
in after quelling a rebellion of tibetans of kansu xining the qing invited the fifth dalai lama to visit their court at beijing since they wished to engender tibetan influence in their dealings with the mongols
the qing were aware the dalai lama had extraordinary influence with the mongols and saw relations with the dalai lama as a means to facilitate submission of the khalka mongols traditional patrons of the karma kagyu sect
similarly since the tibetan gelugpa were keen to revive a priest patron relationship with the dominant power in china and inner asia the qing invitation was accepted
after five years of complex diplomatic negotiations about whether the emperor or his representatives should meet the dalai lama inside or outside the great wall when the meeting would be astrologically favourable how it would be conducted and so on it eventually took place in beijing in
the shunzhi emperor was then years old having in the meantime ascended the throne in after the death of dorgon
for the qing although the dalai lama was not required to kowtow to the emperor who rose from his throne and advanced feet to meet him the significance of the visit was that of nominal political submission by the dalai lama since inner asian heads of state did not travel to meet each other but sent envoys
for tibetan buddhist historians however it was interpreted as the start of an era of independent rule of the dalai lamas and of qing patronage alongside that of the mongols
when the th dalai lama returned he was granted by the emperor of china a golden seal of authority and golden sheets with texts written in manchu tibetan and chinese languages
the th dalai lama wanted to use the golden seal of authority right away
however lobzang gyatsho noted that the tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a mongolian translator but was not a good translation
after correction it read the one who resides in the western peaceful and virtuous paradise is unalterable vajradhara ocen lama unifier of the doctrines of the buddha for all beings under the sky
the words of the diploma ran proclamation to let all the people of the western hemisphere know
tibetan historian nyima gyaincain points out that based on the texts written on golden sheets dalai lama was only a subordinate of the emperor of china
however despite such patronising attempts by chinese officials and historians to symbolically show for the record that they held political influence over tibet the tibetans themselves did not accept any such symbols imposed on them by the chinese with this kind of motive
for example concerning the above mentioned golden seal the fifth dalai lama comments in dukula his autobiography on leaving china after this courtesy visit to the emperor in that the emperor made his men bring a golden seal for me that had three vertical lines in three parallel scripts chinese mongolian and tibetan
he also criticised the words carved on this gift as being faultily translated into tibetan writing that the tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a mongol translator but was not a good translation
furthermore when he arrived back in tibet he discarded the emperor s famous golden seal and made a new one for important state usage writing in his autobiography leaving out the chinese characters that were on the seal given by the emperor a new seal was carved for stamping documents that dealt with territorial issues
the first imprint of the seal was offered with prayers to the image of lokeshvara
the th century struggles for domination between the manchu led qing dynasty and the various mongol groups spilled over to involve tibet because of the fifth dalai lama s strong influence over the mongols as a result of their general adoption of tibetan buddhism and their consequent deep loyalty to the dalai lama as their guru
until the fifth dalai lama had mediated in dzungar mongol affairs whenever they required him to do so and the kangxi emperor who had succeeded the shunzhi emperor in would accept and confirm his decisions automatically
for the kangxi emperor however the alliance between the dzungar mongols and the tibetans was unsettling because he feared it had the potential to unite all the other mongol tribes together against the qing empire including those tribes who had already submitted
therefore in the kangxi emperor annoyed by the fifth s less than full cooperation in quelling a rebellion against the qing in yunnan ceased deferring to him as regards mongol affairs and started dealing with them directly
in the same year the dalai lama then at the height of his powers and conducting a foreign policy independent of the qing caused mongol troops to occupy the border post of dartsedo between kham and sichuan further annoying the kangxi emperor who according to smith already considered tibet as part of the qing empire
it also increased qing suspicion about tibetan relations with the mongol groups and led him to seek strategic opportunities to oppose and undermine mongol influence in tibet and eventually within years to defeat the mongols militarily and to establish the qing as sole patrons and protectors of tibet in their place
the time of the fifth dalai lama who reigned from to and founded the government known as the ganden phodrang was a period of rich cultural development
his reign and that of desi sangye gyatso are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred
the same goes for the great increase in the number of foreign visitors thronging lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the great fifth as the tibetans refer to him
the most dynamic and prolific of the early dalai lamas he composed more literary works than all the other dalai lamas combined
writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history classical indian poetry in sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch as well as his own two autobiographies one spiritual in nature and the other political see further reading
he also taught and travelled extensively reshaped the politics of central asia unified tibet conceived and constructed the potala palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education
the fifth dalai lama died in
tibetan historian nyima gyaincain points out that the written wills from the fifth dalai lama before he died explicitly said his title and authority were from the emperor of china and he was subordinate of the emperor of china
the fifth dalai lama s death in was kept secret for fifteen years by his regent desi sangye gyatso
he pretended the dalai lama was in retreat and ruled on his behalf secretly selecting the th dalai lama and presenting him as someone else
tibetan historian nyima gyaincain points out that desi sangye gyatso wanted to consolidate his personal status and power by not reporting the death of the fifth dalai lama to the emperor of china and also collude with the rebellion group of the qing dynasty mongol dzungar tribe in order to counter influence from another mongol khoshut tribe in tibet
being afraid of prosecution by the kangxi emperor of china desi sangye gyatso explained with fear and trepidation the reason behind his action to the emperor
in desi sangye gyatso was killed by lha bzang khan of the mongol khoshut tribe because of his actions including his illegal action of selecting the th dalai lama
since the kangxi emperor was not happy about desi sangye gyatso s action of not reporting the emperor gave lha bzang khan additional title and golden seal
the kangxi emperor also ordered lha bzang khan to arrest the th dalai lama and send him to beijing the th dalai lama died when he was en route to beijing
journalist thomas laird argues that it was apparently done so that construction of the potala palace could be finished and it was to prevent tibet s neighbors the mongols and the qing from taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the dalai lamas laird pp
the sixth dalai lama was born near tawang now in india and picked out in but not enthroned until when the death of the fifth was announced
after years of study as a novice monk in in his th year he rejected full ordination and gave up his monk s robes and monastic life preferring the lifestyle of a layman
in g shi khan s ruling grandson tenzin wangchuk khan was murdered by his brother lhazang khan who usurped the khoshut s tibetan throne but unlike his four predecessors he started interfering directly in tibetan affairs in lhasa he opposed the fifth dalai lama s regent desi sangye gyatso for his deceptions and in the same year with the support of the kangxi emperor he forced him out of office
then in he used the sixth s escapades as an excuse to seize full control of tibet
most tibetans though still supported their dalai lama despite his behaviour and deeply resented lhazang khan s interference
when lhazang was requested by the tibetans to leave lhasa politics to them and to retire to kokonor like his predecessors he quit the city but only to gather his armies in order to return capture lhasa militarily and assume full political control of tibet
the regent was then murdered by lhazang or his wife and in with the compliance of the kangxi emperor the sixth dalai lama was deposed and arrested by lhazang who considered him to be an impostor set up by the regent
lhazang khan now acting as the only outright foreign ruler that tibet had ever had then sent him to beijing under escort to appear before the emperor but he died mysteriously on the way near lake qinghai ostensibly from illness
having discredited and deposed the sixth dalai lama whom he considered an impostor and having removed the regent lhazang khan pressed the lhasa gelugpa lamas to endorse a new dalai lama in tsangyang gyatso s place as the true incarnation of the fifth
they eventually nominated one pekar dzinpa a monk but also rumored to be lhazang s son and lhazang had him installed as the real sixth dalai lama endorsed by the panchen lama and named yeshe gyatso in
this choice was in no way accepted by the tibetan people however nor by lhazang s princely mongol rivals in kokonor who resented his usurpation of the khoshut tibetan throne as well as his meddling in tibetan affairs
the kangxi emperor concurred with them after sending investigators initially declining to recognize yeshe gyatso
he did recognize him in however after sending a qing official party to assist lhazang in restoring order these were the first chinese representatives of any sort to officiate in tibet
at the same time while this puppet dalai lama had no political power the kangxi emperor secured from lhazang khan in return for this support the promise of regular payments of tribute this was the first time tribute had been paid to the manchu by the mongols in tibet and the first overt acknowledgment of qing supremacy over mongol rule in tibet
in in accordance with an indication given by the th dalai lama when quitting lhasa a child called kelzang gyatso had been born at lithang in eastern tibet who was soon claimed by local tibetans to be his incarnation
after going into hiding out of fear of lhazang khan he was installed in lithang monastery
along with some of the kokonor mongol princes rivals of lhazang in defiance of the situation in lhasa the tibetans of kham duly recognised him as the seventh dalai lama in retaining his birth name of kelzang gyatso
for security reasons he was moved to derge monastery and eventually in now also backed and sponsored by the kangxi emperor of china
the tibetans asked dzungars to bring a true dalai lama to lhasa but the manchu chinese did not want to release kelsan gyatso to the mongol dzungars
the regent taktse shabdrung and tibetan officials then wrote a letter to the manchu chinese emperor that they recognized kelsang gyatso as the dalai lama
the emperor then granted kelsang gyatso a golden seal of authority
the sixth dalai lama was taken to amdo at the age of to be installed in kumbum monastery with great pomp and ceremony
according to smith the kangxi emperor now arranged to protect the child and keep him at kumbum monastery in amdo in reserve just in case his ally lhasang khan and his real sixth dalai lama were overthrown
according to mullin however the emperor s support came from genuine spiritual recognition and respect rather than being politically motivated
in any case the kangxi emperor took full advantage of having kelzang gyatso under qing control at kumbum after other mongols from the dzungar tribes led by tsewang rabtan who was related to his supposed ally lhazang khan deceived and betrayed the latter by invading tibet and capturing lhasa in
these dzungars who were buddhist had supported the fifth dalai lama and his regent
they were secretly petitioned by the lhasa gelugpa lamas to invade with their help in order to rid them of their foreign ruler lhazang khan and to replace the unpopular sixth dalai lama pretender with the young kelzang gyatso
this plot suited the devious dzungar leaders ambitions and they were only too happy to oblige
early in after conspiring to undermine lhazang khan through treachery they entered tibet from the northwest with a large army sending a smaller force to kumbum to collect kelzang gyatso and escort him to lhasa
by the end of the year with tibetan connivance they had captured lhasa killed lhazang and all his family and deposed yeshe gyatso
their force sent to fetch kelzang gyatso however was intercepted and destroyed by qing armies alerted by lhazang
in lhasa the unruly dzungar not only failed to produce the boy but also went on the rampage looting and destroying the holy places abusing the populace killing hundreds of nyingma monks causing chaos and bloodshed and turning their tibetan allies against them
the tibetans were soon appealing to the kangxi emperor to rid them of the dzungars
when the dzungars had first attacked the weakened lhazang sent word to the qing for support and they quickly dispatched two armies to assist the first chinese armies ever to enter tibet but they arrived too late
in they were halted not far from lhasa to be defeated and then ruthlessly annihilated by the triumphant dzungars in the battle of the salween river
this humiliation only determined the kangxi emperor to expel the dzungars from tibet once and for all and he set about assembling and dispatching a much larger force to march on lhasa bringing the emperor s trump card the young kelzang gyatso with it
on the imperial army s stately passage from kumbum to lhasa with the boy being welcomed adoringly at every stage khoshut mongols and tibetans were happy and well paid to join and swell its ranks
by the autumn of the marauding dzungar mongols had been vanquished from tibet and the qing imperial forces had entered lhasa triumphantly with the year old acting as patrons of the dalai lama liberators of tibet allies of the tibetan anti dzungar forces led by kangchenas and polhanas and allies of the khoshut mongol princes
the delighted tibetans enthroned him as the seventh dalai lama at the potala palace
a new tibetan government was established consisting of a kashag or cabinet of tibetan ministers headed by kangchenas
kelzang gyatso too young to participate in politics studied buddhism
he played a symbolic role in government and being profoundly revered by the mongols he exercised much influence with the qing who now had now taken over tibet s patronage and protection from them
having vanquished the dzungars the qing army withdrew leaving the seventh dalai lama as a political figurehead and only a khalkha mongol as the qing amban or representative and a garrison in lhasa
after the kangxi emperor died in and was succeeded by his son the yongzheng emperor these were also withdrawn leaving the tibetans to rule autonomously and showing the qing were interested in an alliance not conquest
in however after brutally quelling a major rebellion by zealous tibetan patriots and disgruntled khoshut mongols from amdo who attacked xining the qing intervened again splitting tibet by putting amdo and kham under their own more direct control
continuing qing interference in central tibetan politics and religion incited an anti qing faction to quarrel with the qing sympathising tibetan nobles in power in lhasa led by kanchenas who was supported by polhanas
this led eventually to the murder of kanchenas in and a civil war that was resolved in with the canny polhanas who had sent for qing assistance the victor
when the qing forces did arrive they punished the losers and exiled the seventh dalai lama to kham under the pretence of sending him to beijing because his father had assisted the defeated anti qing faction
he studied and taught buddhism there for the next seven years
in he was allowed back to lhasa to study and teach but still under strict control being mistrusted by the qing while polhanas ruled central tibet under nominal qing supervision
meanwhile the qing had promoted the fifth panchen lama to be a rival leader and reinstated the ambans and the lhasa garrison
polhanas died in and was succeeded by his son gyurme namgyal the last dynastic ruler of tibet who was far less cooperative with the qing
on the contrary he built a tibetan army and started conspiring with the dzungars to rid tibet of qing influence
in when the ambans realised this they invited him and personally assassinated him and then despite the dalai lama s attempts to calm the angered populace a vengeful tibetan mob assassinated the ambans in turn along with most of their escort
the qing sent yet another force to restore order but when it arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of the th dalai lama who was now seen to have demonstrated loyalty to the qing
just as g shi khan had done with the fifth dalai lama they therefore helped reconstitute the government with the dalai lama presiding over a kashag of four tibetans reinvesting him with temporal power in addition to his already established spiritual leadership
this arrangement with a kashag under the dalai lama or his regent outlasted the qing dynasty which collapsed in
the ambans and their garrison were also reinstated to observe and to some extent supervise affairs however although their influence generally waned with the power of their empire which gradually declined after along with its influence over tibet a decline aided by a succession of corrupt or incompetent ambans
moreover there was soon no reason for the qing to fear the dzungar by the time the seventh dalai lama died in at the age of the entire dzungar people had been practically exterminated through years of genocidal campaigns by qing armies and deadly smallpox epidemics with the survivors being forcibly transported into china
their emptied lands were then awarded to other peoples
according to mullin despite living through such violent times kelzang gyatso was perhaps the most spiritually learned and accomplished of any dalai lama his written works comprising several hundred titles including some of tibet s finest spiritual literary achievements
in addition despite his apparent lack of zeal in politics kelzang gyatso is credited with establishing in the reformed government of tibet headed by the dalai lama which continued over years until the s and then in exile
construction of the norbulingka the summer palace of the dalai lamas in lhasa was also started during kelzang gyatso s reign
the eighth dalai lama jamphel gyatso was born in tsang in and died aged having taken little part in tibetan politics mostly leaving temporal matters to his regents and the ambans
the th dalai lama was approved by the emperor of china to be exempted from the lot drawing ceremony of using chinese golden urn
qianlong emperor officially accept gyiangbai as the th dalai lama when the th panchen erdeni came to congratulate the emperor on his th birthday in
the th dalai lama was granted a jade seal of authority and jade sheets of confirmation of authority by the emperor of china
the jade sheets of confirmation of authority says
the dalai lama his later generations and the local government cherished both the jade seal of authority and the jade sheets of authority
they were properly preserved as the root to their ruling power
although the th dalai lama lived almost as long as the seventh he was overshadowed by many contemporary lamas in terms of both religious and political accomplishment
according to mullin the th dalai lama has pointed to certain indications that jamphel gyatso might not have been the incarnation of the th dalai lama but of jamyang chojey a disciple of tsongkhapa and founder of drepung monastery who was also reputed to be an incarnation of avalokiteshvara
in any case he mainly lived a quiet and unassuming life as a devoted and studious monk uninvolved in the kind of dramas that had surrounded his predecessors
nevertheless jamphel gyatso was also said to possess all the signs of being the true incarnation of the seventh
this was also claimed to have been confirmed by many portents clear to the tibetans and so in at the age of he was duly enthroned as the eighth dalai lama at the potala palace
at the age of he was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of tibet with a regent to assist him and after three years of this when the regent went to beijing as ambassador in he continued to rule solo for a further four years
feeling unsuited to worldly affairs however and unhappy in this role he then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for his remaining years until his death in
he is also credited with the construction of the norbulingka summer palace started by his predecessor in lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in his efforts to foster monasticism
hugh richardson s summary of the period covering the four short lived th century dalai lamas
thubten jigme norbu the elder brother of the th dalai lama described these unfortunate events as follows although there are few if any indications that any of the four were said to be chinese appointed imposters
according to mullin on the other hand it is improbable that the manchus would have murdered any of these four for being unmanageable since it would have been in their best interests to have strong dalai lamas ruling in lhasa he argues agreeing with richardson that it was rather the ambition and greed for power of tibetans that might have caused the lamas early deaths
further if tibetan nobles murdered any of them it would more likely have been in order to protect or enhance their family interests rather than out of suspicion that the dalai lamas were seen as chinese appointed imposters as suggested by norbu
they could also have died from illnesses possibly contracted from diseases to which they had no immunity carried to lhasa by the multitudes of pilgrims visiting from nearby countries for blessings
finally from the buddhist point of view mullin says simply stated these four dalai lamas died young because the world did not have enough good karma to deserve their presence
tibetan historian k
dhondup however in his history the water bird and other years based on the tibetan minister surkhang sawang chenmo s historical manuscripts disagrees with mullin s opinion that having strong dalai lamas in power in tibet would have been in china s best interests
he notes that many historians are compelled to suspect manchu foul play in these serial early deaths because the ambans had such latitude to interfere the manchu he says to perpetuate their domination over tibetan affairs did not desire a dalai lama who will ascend the throne and become a strong and capable ruler over his own country and people
the life and deeds of the th dalai lama in successfully upholding de facto tibetan independence from china from to serve as the living proof of this argument he points out
this account also corresponds with tj norbu s observations above
finally while acknowledging the possibility the th dalai lama himself doubts they were poisoned
he ascribes the probable cause of these early deaths to negligence foolishness and lack of proper medical knowledge and attention
even today he is quoted as saying when people get sick some tibetans will say just do your prayers you don t need medical treatment
born in kham in amidst the usual miraculous signs the ninth dalai lama lungtok gyatso was appointed by the th panchen lama s search team at the age of two and enthroned in the potala in at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from china mongolia nepal and bhutan
tibetan historian nyima gyaincain and wang jiawei point out that the th dalai lama was allowed to use the seal of authority given to the late th dalai lama by the emperor of china
his second regent demo tulku was the biographer of the th and th dalai lamas and though the th died at the age of his biography is as lengthy as those of many of the early dalai lamas
in under manchu pressure tibet had closed its borders to foreigners but in a british sinologist thomas manning became the first englishman to visit lhasa
considered to be the first chinese scholar in europe he stayed five months and gave enthusiastic accounts in his journal of his regular meetings with the ninth dalai lama whom he found fascinating beautiful elegant refined intelligent and entirely self possessed even at the age of six
three years later in march the young lungtok gyatso caught a severe cold and leaving the potala palace to preside over the monlam prayer festival he contracted pneumonia from which he soon died
like the seventh dalai lama the tenth tsultrim gyatso was born in lithang kham where the third dalai lama had built a monastery
it was and regent demo tulku and the seventh panchen lama followed indications from nechung the state oracle which led them to appoint him at the age of two
he passed all the tests and was brought to lhasa but official recognition was delayed until when he was enthroned and ordained by the seventh panchen lama
there are conflicting reports about whether the chinese golden urn was utilised by drawing lots to choose him
the th dalai lama mentioned in his biography that he was allowed to use the golden seal of authority based on the convention set up by the late dalai lama
at the investiture decree of the emperor of china was issued and read out
after years of intensive studies and failing health he died in at the age of or
he identified with ordinary people rather than the court officials and often sat on his verandah in the sunshine with the office clerks
intending to empower the common people he planned to institute political and economic reforms to share the nation s wealth more equitably
over this period his health had deteriorated the implication being that he may have suffered from slow poisoning by tibetan aristocrats whose interests these reforms were threatening
he was also dissatisfied with his regent and the kashag and scolded them for not alleviating the condition of the common people who had suffered much in small ongoing regional civil wars waged in kokonor between mongols local tibetans and the government over territory and in kham to extract unpaid taxes from rebellious tibetan communities
born in gathar kham in and soon discovered by the official search committee with the help of the nechung oracle the eleventh dalai lama was brought to lhasa in and recognised enthroned and named khedrup gyatso by the panchen lama in who also ordained him in
after that he was immersed in religious studies under the panchen lama amongst other great masters
meanwhile there were court intrigues and ongoing power struggles taking place between the various lhasa factions the regent the kashag the powerful nobles and the abbots and monks of the three great monasteries
the tsemonling regent became mistrusted and was forcibly deposed there were machinations plots beatings and kidnappings of ministers and so forth resulting at last in the panchen lama being appointed as interim regent to keep the peace
eventually the third reting rinpoche was made regent and in khedrup gyatso appearing to be an extremely promising prospect was requested to take the reins of power at the age of
he was enthroned as ruler of tibet in on orders of the xianfeng emperor
he died after just months no reason for his sudden and premature death being given in these accounts shakabpa and mullin s histories both being based on untranslated tibetan chronicles
the respected reting rinpoche was recalled once again to act as regent and requested to lead the search for the next incarnation the twelfth
in a child was born in south central tibet amidst all the usual extraordinary signs
he came to the notice of the search team was investigated passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the th dalai lama in
the use of the chinese golden urn at the insistence of the regent who was later accused of being a chinese lackey confirmed this choice to the satisfaction of all
renamed trinley gyatso and enthroned in the boy underwent years of intensive tutelage and training before stepping up to rule tibet at the age of
his minority seems a time of even deeper lhasan political intrigue and power struggles than his predecessor s
by this led to a coup by wangchuk shetra a minister whom the regent had banished for conspiring against him
shetra contrived to return deposed the regent who fled to china and seized power appointing himself desi or prime minister
he then ruled with absolute power for three years quelling a major rebellion in northern kham in and re establishing tibetan control over significant qing held territory there
shetra died in and the kashag re assumed power
the retired th ganden tripa khyenrab wangchuk was appointed as regent but his role was limited to supervising and mentoring trinley gyatso
in shetra s coup organiser a semi literate ganden monk named palden dondrup seized power by another coup and ruled as a cruel despot for three years putting opponents to death by having them sewn into fresh animal skins and thrown in the river
in at the request of officials outraged after dondrup had done just that with one minister and imprisoned several others he in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter coup coordinated by the supposedly powerless regent khyenrab wangchuk
as a result of this action this venerable old regent who died the next year is fondly remembered by tibetans as saviour of the dalai lama and the nation
the kashag and the tsongdu or national assembly were re instated and presided over by a dalai lama or his regent ruled without further interruption until
according to smith however during trinley gyatso s minority the regent was deposed in for abuse of authority and closeness with china by an alliance of monks and officials called gandre drungche ganden and drepung monks assembly this body then ruled tibet for ten years until dissolved when a national assembly of monks and officials called the tsongdu was created and took over
smith makes no mention of shetra or dondrup acting as usurpers and despots in this period
in any case trinley gyatso died within three years of assuming power
in at the age of he suddenly became ill and passed away
on the cause of his early death accounts diverge
mullin relates an interesting theory based on cited tibetan sources out of concern for the monastic tradition trinley gyatso chose to die and reincarnate as the th dalai lama rather than taking the option of marrying a woman called rigma tsomo from kokonor and leaving an heir to oversee tibet s future
shakabpa on the other hand without citing sources notes that trinley gyatso was influenced and manipulated by two close acquaintances who were subsequently accused of having a hand in his fatal illness and imprisoned tortured and exiled as a result
in request to exempt lobu zangtab kaijia mucuo chinese from using lot drawing process golden urn to become the th dalai lama was approved by the central government
the th dalai lama assumed ruling power from the monasteries which previously had great influence on the regent in
due to his two periods of exile in to escape the british invasion of and from to escape a chinese invasion he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first dalai lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations
after his return from exile in india and sikkim during january he assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the maharaja with the british political officer in sikkim and with the king of nepal rather than letting the kashag or parliament do it
sheel pp
the great thirteenth thubten gyatso then published the tibetan declaration of independence for the entirety of tibet in
tibet s independence was never recognized by the chinese who claimed all land ever administered by the manchus but was recognized by the kingdom of nepal who would use tibet as one of its first references regarding its independent status when submitting an application to join the un
on it nepal listed tibet as a country just as independent and sovereign with no mention of chinese suzerainty
its relations with tibet were apparently second in significance only to its relations with britain and even more significant than its relations with the usa or even india
furthermore tibet and mongolia both signed the treaty of friendship and alliance between the government of mongolia and tibet
neither countries independence statuses were ever recognized by the kmt government in china who would continue to completely claim both as chinese territory
he expelled the ambans and all chinese civilians in the country and instituted many measures to modernize tibet
these included provisions to curb excessive demands on peasants for provisions by the monasteries and tax evasion by the nobles setting up an independent police force the abolition of the death penalty extension of secular education and the provision of electricity throughout the city of lhasa in the s
norbu turnbull pp he died in
the th dalai lama was born on july on a straw mat in a cowshed to a farmer s family in a remote part of tibet
according to most western journalistic sources he was born into a humble family of farmers as one of children and one of the three reincarnated rinpoches in the same family
on february request to exempt lhamo thondup chinese from lot drawing process to become the th dalai lama was approved by the central government
the th dalai lama had become the joint most popular world leader by tied with barack obama according to a poll conducted by harris interactive of new york which sampled public opinion in the us and six major european countries
the th dalai lama was not formally enthroned until november during the battle of chamdo with the people s republic of china
on april the th dalai lama issued statement that in the dalai lama and the tibetan government were pressured into accepting the seventeen point agreement for the peaceful liberation of tibet by which it became formally incorporated into the people s republic of china
the united states already informed the dalai lama in that in order to receive assistance and support from the united states he must depart from tibet and publicly disavow agreements concluded under duress between the representatives of tibet and china
fearing for his life in the wake of a revolt in tibet in the th dalai lama fled to india from where he led a government in exile
with the aim of launching guerrilla operations against the chinese the central intelligence agency funded the dalai lama s administration with us million a year in the s
in the th dalai lama ceded his partial power over the government to an elected parliament of selected tibetan exiles
his original goal was full independence for tibet but by the late s he was seeking high level autonomy instead
he continued to seek greater autonomy from china but dolma gyari deputy speaker of the parliament in exile stated if the middle path fails in the short term we will be forced to opt for complete independence or self determination as per the un charter
in and he stated that tibet wants to be part of china but china should let tibet preserve its culture and script
in he stated that europe belongs to the europeans and that europe has a moral obligation to aid refugees whose lives are in peril
further he stated that europe should receive help and educate refugees but ultimately they should return to develop their home countries
in march the dalai lama spoke out about his successor saying that after his death he is likely to be reincarnated in india
he also warned that any chinese interference in succession should not be considered valid
in october he stated that he did not support tibetan independence and hoped to visit china as a nobel prize winner
he said i prefer the concept of a republic in the people s republic of china
in the concept of republic ethnic minorities are like tibetans the mongols manchus and xinjiang uyghurs we can live in harmony
the st dalai lama was based at tashi lhunpo monastery which he founded and the second to the fifth dalai lamas were mainly based at drepung monastery outside lhasa
in after the unification of tibet the fifth moved to the ruins of a royal fortress or residence on top of marpori red mountain in lhasa and decided to build a palace on the same site
this ruined palace called tritse marpo was originally built around ad by the founder of the tibetan empire songtsen gampo for his nepalese wife
amongst the ruins there was just a small temple left where tsongkhapa had given a teaching when he arrived in lhasa in the s
the fifth dalai lama began construction of the potala palace on this site in carefully incorporating what was left of his predecessor s palace into its structure
from then on and until today unless on tour or in exile the dalai lamas have always spent their winters at the potala palace and their summers at the norbulingka palace and park
both palaces are in lhasa and approximately km apart
following the failed tibetan uprising the th dalai lama sought refuge in india
indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru allowed in the dalai lama and the tibetan government officials
the dalai lama has since lived in exile in mcleod ganj in the kangra district of himachal pradesh in northern india where the central tibetan administration is also established
his residence on the temple road in mcleod ganj is called the dalai lama temple and is visited by people from across the globe
tibetan refugees have constructed and opened many schools and buddhist temples in dharamshala
by the himalayan tradition phowa is the discipline that is believed to transfer the mindstream to the intended body
upon the death of the dalai lama and consultation with the nechung oracle a search for the lama s yangsi or reincarnation is conducted
the government of the people s republic of china has stated its intention to be the ultimate authority on the selection of the next dalai lama
high lamas may also claim to have a vision by a dream or if the dalai lama was cremated they will often monitor the direction of the smoke as an indication of the direction of the expected rebirth
if there is only one boy found the high lamas will invite living buddhas of the three great monasteries together with secular clergy and monk officials to confirm their findings and then report to the central government through the minister of tibet
later a group consisting of the three major servants of dalai lama eminent officials and troops will collect the boy and his family and travel to lhasa where the boy would be taken usually to drepung monastery to study the buddhist sutra in preparation for assuming the role of spiritual leader of tibet
if there are several possible claimed reincarnations however regents eminent officials monks at the jokhang in lhasa and the minister to tibet have historically decided on the individual by putting the boys names inside an urn and drawing one lot in public if it was too difficult to judge the reincarnation initially
there have been recognised incarnations of the dalai lama
there has also been one non recognised dalai lama ngawang yeshe gyatso declared june when he was years old by lha bzang khan as the true th dalai lama however he was never accepted as such by the majority of the population
the government of the people s republic of china prc has claimed the power to approve the naming of high reincarnations in tibet based on a precedent set by the qianlong emperor of the qing dynasty
the qianlong emperor instituted a system of selecting the dalai lama and the panchen lama by a lottery that used a golden urn with names wrapped in clumps of barley
this method was used a few times for both positions during the th century but eventually fell into disuse
in the dalai lama chose to proceed with the selection of the th reincarnation of the panchen lama without the use of the golden urn while the chinese government insisted that it must be used
this has led to two rival panchen lamas gyaincain norbu as chosen by the chinese government s process and gedhun choekyi nyima as chosen by the dalai lama
however nyima was abducted by the chinese government shortly after being chosen as the panchen lama and has not been seen in public since
in september the chinese government said all high monks must be approved by the government which would include the selection of the th dalai lama after the death of tenzin gyatso
since by tradition the panchen lama must approve the reincarnation of the dalai lama that is another possible method of control
consequently the dalai lama has alluded to the possibility of a referendum to determine the th dalai lama
in response to this scenario tashi wangdi the representative of the th dalai lama replied that the chinese government s selection would be meaningless
you can t impose an imam an archbishop saints any religion you can t politically impose these things on people said wangdi
it has to be a decision of the followers of that tradition
the chinese can use their political power force
again it s meaningless
like their panchen lama
and they can t keep their panchen lama in tibet
they tried to bring him to his monastery many times but people would not see him
how can you have a religious leader like that
the th dalai lama said as early as that it was for the tibetans to decide whether the institution of the dalai lama should continue or not
he has given reference to a possible vote occurring in the future for all tibetan buddhists to decide whether they wish to recognize his rebirth
in response to the possibility that the prc might attempt to choose his successor the dalai lama said he would not be reborn in a country controlled by the people s republic of china or any other country which is not free
according to robert d
kaplan this could mean that the next dalai lama might come from the tibetan cultural belt that stretches across ladakh himachal pradesh nepal and bhutan presumably making him even more pro indian and hence anti chinese
the th dalai lama supported the possibility that his next incarnation could be a woman
as an engaged buddhist the dalai lama has an appeal straddling cultures and political systems making him one of the most recognized and respected moral voices today
despite the complex historical religious and political factors surrounding the selection of incarnate masters in the exiled tibetan tradition the dalai lama is open to change author michaela haas writes
