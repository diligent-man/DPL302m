Self-employment is the state of working for oneself rather than an employer
Tax authorities will generally view a person as self-employed if the person chooses to be recognised as such or if the person is generating income for which a tax return needs to be filed
In the real world the critical issue for the tax authorities is not whether a person is engaged in a business activity called trading even when it's a service but whether the activity is profitable and therefore potentially taxable
In other words the activity of trading is likely to be ignored if no profit is present so occasional and hobby- or enthusiast-based economic activity is generally ignored by the tax authorities
Self-employed people are usually classified as a sole proprietor or sole trader independent contractor or as a member of a partnership
Self-employed people generally find their own work rather than being provided with work by an employer and instead earn income from a profession a trade or a business that they operate
In some countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom the authorities are placing more emphasis on clarifying whether an individual is self-employed or engaged in disguised employment in other words pretending to be in a contractual intra-business relationship to hide what is in fact an employer-employee relationship

In the United States immigrants tend to have higher rates of self-employment than native-born Americans regardless of race or ethnicity
But self-employment in the United States is unevenly distributed across racialethnic lines
Immigrants and their children who self-identify as White have the highest probability of self-employment in lucrative industries such as professional services and finance
In contrast racial and ethnic minorities are less likely than native-born Whites to be self-employed with the exception of Asian immigrants who have a high rates of self-employment in low prestige industries such as retail trade and personal services
Much like the regular labor market self-employment in the United States is stratified across racial lines
In general self-employment is more common among immigrants than their second-generation children born in the United States
However the second-generation children of Asian immigrants may continue to seek self-employment in a variety of industries and occupations

A study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Pennsylvania State University looked at US
Bureau of Economic Analysis the absolute number of people registered as non-farm proprietors NFPs or self-employed in metropolitan counties grew by between and and by in non-metropolitan counties
In relative terms the share of self-employed within the labor force grew from in to in in metropolitan counties and from to in non-metropolitan counties
In non-metropolitan counties the study found that increased levels of self-employment were associated with strong increases in per capita income and job creation and significant reductions in family poverty levels
In the average income of non-farm proprietors was compared to earned by salaried employees by the difference in earnings widened to in favor of salaried employees
The study notes that the gap could be due to underreporting of income by the self-employed
Alternatively low-productivity workers could be losing their jobs and are forced to be self-employed
Further some research shows that higher local unemployment rates lead workers to self-select into self-employment as does past unemployment experience

The European Commission defines a self-employed person as someone pursuing a gainful activity for their own account under the conditions laid down by national law
In the exercise of such an activity the personal element is of special importance and such exercise always involves a large measure of independence in the accomplishment of the professional activities
This definition comes from Directive EU on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity
This is in contrast to an employee who is subordinate to and dependent on an employer
In addition Article of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU provides for the free movement of those taking up and pursuing activities as self-employed people
It stipulates In order to make it easier for persons to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons the Council shall… issue Directives for the mutual recognition of diplomas certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications

As indicated by the European Commission in there are different understandings and definitions of the term self-employment across the countries with a number of different subcategories defined for instance according to the legal status of the enterprise whether the business has employees or not employers versus own-account workers andor the sector in which the business operates
Some countries also make the distinction between self-employed status and the status of 'dependent self-employed' eg
Spain Italy where the self-employed person works for only one client
Others distinguish self-employment which is carried out in addition to paid employment eg
The EN European Parliament Resolution on Social Protection for All has stated that the absence of a clear national definition of self-employment increases the risk of false self-employment and the European Parliament Resolution on the Renewed Social Agenda invites Member States to take initiatives that would lead to a clear distinction between employers genuine self-employed and small entrepreneurs on the one hand and employees on the other
