The First Republic of Armenia officially known at the time of its existence as the Republic of Armenia classical Armenian was the first modern Armenian state since the loss of Armenian statehood in the Middle Ages
The republic was established in the Armenian populated territories of the disintegrated Russian Empire known as Eastern Armenia or Russian Armenia The leaders of the government came mostly from the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ARF or Dashnaktsutyun The First Republic of Armenia bordered the Democratic Republic of Georgia to the north the Ottoman Empire to the west Persia to the south and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic to the east It had a total land area of roughly km and a population of million
The Armenian National Council declared the independence of Armenia on May From its very onset Armenia was plagued with a variety of domestic and foreign issues A humanitarian crisis emerged from the aftermath of the Armenian genocide as hundreds of thousands of Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire were forced to settle in the fledgling republic Lasting two and a half years in existence the Republic of Armenia became involved in several armed conflicts with its neighbors caused by overlapping territorial claims By late the nation was partitioned between the Turkish Nationalist forces and Russian Red Army The First Republic along with the Republic of Mountainous Armenia which repelled the Soviet invasion until July ceased to exist as an independent state superseded by the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic that became part of the Soviet Union in After the fall of the Soviet Union the republic regained its independence as the current Republic of Armenia in
The Russian offensive during the Caucasus Campaign of World War I the subsequent occupation and the creation of a provisional administrative government gave hope for ending Ottoman Turkish rule in Western Armenia With the help of several battalions of Armenians recruited from the Russian Empire the Russian army had made progress on the Caucasus Front advancing as far as the city of Erzurum in The Russians continued to make considerable advances even after the toppling of Tsar Nicholas II in February
In March the spontaneous revolution that toppled Tsar Nicholas and the Romanov dynasty established a caretaker administration known as the Provisional Government Shortly after the Provisional Government replaced Grand Duke Nicholas' administration in the Caucasus with the five member Special Transcaucasian Committee known by the acronym Ozakom The Ozakom included Armenian Democrat Mikayel Papadjanian and was set to heal wounds inflicted by the old regime In doing so Western Armenia was to have a general commissar and was to be subdivided into the districts of Trebizond Erzerum Bitlis and Van The decree was a major concession to the Armenians Western Armenia was placed under the central government and through it under immediate Armenian jurisdiction Dr Hakob Zavriev would serve as the assistant for civil affairs and he in turn would see to it that most civil officials were Armenian
In October the Bolsheviks seized power from the Provisional Government and announced that they would be withdrawing troops from both the Western and Caucasus fronts The Armenians Georgians and Muslims of the Caucasus all rejected the Bolsheviks' legitimacy
On December the Ottoman Empire and the Transcaucasian Commissariat signed the armistice of Erzincan ending armed conflict After the Bolshevik seizure of power a multinational congress of Transcaucasian representatives met to create a provisional regional executive body known as the Transcaucasian Seim The Commissariat and the Seim were heavily encumbered by the pretense that the South Caucasus formed an integral unit of a non existent Russian democracy The Armenian deputies in the Seim were hopeful that the anti Bolshevik forces in Russia would prevail in the Russian Civil War and rejected any idea of separating from Russia In February the Armenians Georgians and Muslims had reluctantly joined to form the Transcaucasian Federation but disputes among the three groups continued as unity began to falter
On March Russia followed the armistice of Erzincan with the Treaty of Brest Litovsk and left the war It ceded territory from March to April when a conference was held between the Ottoman Empire and the delegation of the Seim Under the Treaty of Brest Litovsk the Russians allowed the Turks to retake the Western Armenian provinces as well as to take over the provinces of Kars Batum and Ardahan
In addition to these provisions a secret clause obligated the Armenians and Russians to demobilize their forces in both western and eastern Armenia Having killed and deported most of Armenians of Western Armenia during the Armenian genocide the Ottoman Empire intended to eliminate the Armenian population of Eastern Armenia Shortly after the signing of Brest Litovsk the Turkish army began its advance taking Erzurum in March and Kars in April which the Transcaucasian government of Nikolay Chkheidze had ordered soldiers to abandon Beginning on May the Ottoman army moved ahead again
On May a new peace conference opened at Batum At this conference the Ottomans extended their demands to include Tiflis as well as Alexandropol and Echmiadzin which they wanted for a railroad to be built to connect Kars and Julfa with Baku The Armenian and Georgian members of the Republic's delegation began to stall
On May Georgia declared independence on May it signed the Treaty of Poti and received protection from Germany The following day the Muslim National Council in Tiflis announced the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan
Having been abandoned by its regional allies the Armenian National Council based in Tiflis and led by Russian Armenian intellectuals who represented Armenian interests in the Caucasus declared its independence on May It dispatched Hovhannes Kajaznuni and Alexander Khatisyan both members of the ARF to Yerevan to take over power and issued the following statement on May retroactive to May
Meanwhile the Turks had taken Alexandropol and were intent on eliminating the center of Armenian resistance based in Yerevan The Armenians were able to stave off total defeat and delivered crushing blows to the Turkish army in the battles of Sardarapat Karakilisa and Abaran
The Republic of Armenia had to sue for negotiations at the Treaty of Batum which was signed in Batum on June It was Armenia's first treaty After the Ottoman Empire took vast swathes of territory and imposed harsh conditions the new republic was left with square kilometers
On May the Armenian Revolutionary Federation had decided that Armenia should be a republic under a provisional coalition government The declaration stated that the Republic of Armenia was to be a self governing state endowed with a constitution the supremacy of state authority independence sovereignty and plenipotentiary power Kajaznuni became the country's first Prime Minister and Aram Manukian was the first minister of Interior
The constitution granted universal suffrage to all citizens regardless of qualifiers who were at least twenty years old The first elections under the new constitution occurred between and June and of the members elected to Parliament three were women Perchuhi Partizpanyan Barseghyan Varvara Sahakyan and Katarine Zalyan Manukyan
Armenia established a Ministry of Interior and created a police force The Armenian parliament passed a law on the police on April specifying its structure jurisdiction and responsibilities The Interior Ministry was also responsible for communications and telegraph railroad and the public school system in addition to enforcing law and order The reforms came soon and each of these departments became ministries
In the leaders of the Republic had to deal with issues on three fronts domestic regional and international The Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians that took control in fell apart and in June the first national elections would be held During the s which began under the premiership of Hovhannes Kajaznuni Armenians from within the former Russian Empire and the United States would assist in developing the fledgling Republic's judicial system In January another important milestone was completed by the Armenian Parliament which was the opening of the country's first state university Yerevan State University

Arsham Khondkaryan November December Thanks to the efforts of Armenian National Council of Tiflis the Armenian National Corps was established to fight against the Ottoman offensive of late and early On December the Armenian National Corps was established with General Tovmas Nazarbekian was appointed commander and Drastamat Kanayan became the defence minister Nazarbekian used his experience in the Russian Caucasus Army to aid in the creation of the regular army Units of this corps formed the basis of the Armenian army Armenian conscripts and volunteers from the Russian Army later established the core of the armed forces of the First Republic In accordance with the harsh terms of the Treaty of Batum signed on June the Ottoman Empire demobilized most of the Armenian army They were allowed only a limited force and were severely restricted in where their troops could operate
The Armenian National Corps had the following military units
rifle divisions which included artillery batteries
Armenian volunteer Division which included
st Brigade Erzurum Regiment and the Yerznka Regiment
nd Brigade Khnus Regiment Gharakilisa Regiment Van Regiment and the Zeytun Regiment
Khanasor DetachmentThe Armenian republic included the following subdivisions of the former Russian Empire
Before World War I in the territory was part of Russian Armenia among the total Armenian population of about lived in the Ottoman Empire and the remainder were in Russian Armenia An estimate in during the new Armenian Republic's first year indicated that there were Armenians and more than Muslims mostly Ottoman Turks and Azerbaijani Turks and Kurds everywhere else Of the Armenians about were native Russian Armenians and were destitute and starving refugees fleeing from the massacres that took place in the Ottoman Empire
The surviving Armenian population in was two million of whom were distributed in the Caucasus Of these in the Caucasus were to be found within the boundaries of the new Republic of Armenia which included to refugees who had escaped from the Ottoman Empire There were Armenians in the new Republic Also added to this Armenian population were to people of other nationalities and a total population of about within the Armenian Republic
The surviving Armenian population in was in the republic in Georgia in Azerbaijan and those in the other regions of the Caucasus brought the total to
In a memorandum to the Paris peace conference of the territorial claims of Integral Armenia the Armenian delegation included the whole Erivan Governorate most of the Kars Oblast the southwestern parts of the Tiflis Governorate and the western part of the Elisabethpol Governorate The nationalities of each claimed region is as follows
There was also an Armenian settlement problem that brought conflict with other ethnic residents In all there were over embittered and impatient Armenian refugees escaping from the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire who were now the government's responsibility This proved an insurmountable humanitarian issue Typhus was a major sickness because of its effect on children Conditions in the outlying regions not necessarily consisting of refugees weren't any better The Ottoman governing structure and Russian army had already withdrawn from the region The Armenian government had neither time nor resources to rebuild the infrastructure In the throngs of refugees were distributed as follows
The government of Hovhannes Kajaznuni was faced with a most sobering reality in the winter of The newly formed government was responsible for over half a million Armenian refugees in the Caucasus It was a long and harsh winter The homeless masses lacking food clothing and medicine had to endure the elements Many who survived the exposure and famine succumbed to the ravaging diseases By the spring of the typhus epidemic had run its course the weather improved and the first American Committee for Relief in the Near East shipment of wheat reached Batum The British army transported the aid to Yerevan Yet by that time some of the refugees had perished Vratsian puts this figure at around or nearly of the entire nascent Republic of the inhabitants of eight villages near Etchmiadzin and of the sixteen villages in neighboring Ashtarak had succumbed by April During the winter of the population of Talin a district midway between Etchmiadzin and Alexandropol was cut in half and nearly of the Armenians in the Surmalu uyezd starved to death
By April the refugees from parts of Russian Armenia occupied by the Ottoman Army in had been largely resettled however refugees from Western Armenia were still distributed around the Armenian Republic awaiting the political resolution and unification of their homeland to the eastern Armenian state There were also Armenian orphans throughout orphanages in Transcaucasia of whom were within the borders of Armenia Western Armenian refugees and orphans were distributed as follows
By the Republic of Armenia administered an area that covered most of present day Armenia in addition to most of the Kars Surmalu and Nakhichevan districts The regions of Nakhichevan Nagorno Karabakh Zangezur corresponding to the contemporary province of Syunik and Dilijan also referred to as Kazakh Shamshadin corresponding to the contemporary province of Tavush were strongly disputed and fought over with neighbouring Azerbaijan whom considered these regions to be of tantamount importance
The Olti Okrug the western half of which was controlled by Turco Kurdish militias since the Ottoman withdrawal was claimed by Armenia as a constituent county of the larger Kars Oblast however they were unable to establish full control over it The overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian Lori uchastok was disputed and jointly administered with Georgia following the conclusion of the week war over the region and the establishment of the Lori Neutral Zone South of the capital of the republic centered in Davalu and Zangibasar local Azerbaijanis openly rebelled against the Armenian government during the Muslim uprisings of July
Following the disestablishment of the Aras Republic and Armenia's consolidation of Nakhichevan acting prime minister Khatisian in Julfa wired salutations to Persian Prime Minister Vosuq ed Dowleh who replied by extolling the traditional bonds between Armenia and Persia and welcoming the Republic of Armenia as a neighbor
On January on account of the defeat of Denikin's Volunteer Army the League of Nations and the Supreme Allied Council formally recognized the three Transcaucasian republics including Armenia as de facto governments over the region in a last ditch attempt to deter Bolshevik Russian penetration into the Transcaucasus
Despite the difficulties Armenia faced in consolidating its territory after the signing of the Treaty of S vres in it was granted formal diplomatic de jure recognition by the Great Powers The United States as well as several South American nations officially opened diplomatic channels with the government Armenian diplomatic and consular missions were established in the United Kingdom Italy Germany Serbia Romania Greece Iran Japan and Africa
In December Armenia and Georgia engaged in a brief military conflict over disputed border areas in the largely Armenian populated Lori and Akhalkalak districts along with some other neighboring regions Both nations claimed the districts which Georgia had occupied after the Ottomans evacuated the area Inconclusive fighting continued for two weeks An Armenian offensive under Drastamat Kanayan Dro made substantial gains in the first ten days By December Armenian troops had reached positions kilometres miles from Tiflis which had a plurality of Armenian population back then when the Allied representatives in the city intervened On January military operations of both sides ceased and peace talks began supervised by the British and French which ended in Tbilisi a few days later The draft British plan established that Georgian troops would remain in Akhalkalak and northern Borchaly whereas Armenian forces would settle in southern Borchaly and the British would take positions between the two opponents This forced Armenia to relinquish its wartime gains in the region including the copper mines of Alaverdi Georgia accepted the plan and the Allies decided to impose it with or without the approval of the government of Armenia Finally hostilities ceased on December when the parties agreed to the British brokered ceasefire British mediation facilitated the end of the war and resulted in the establishment of a joint Armeno Georgian civil administration in the Lori Neutral Zone or the Shulavera Condominium Along the newly created border numerous Armenian settlements like Akhalkalak Samshvilde Bolnis Khachen and Shulaver remained under Georgian control since then while there were no Georgian settlements under Armenian control
Relations between Armenia and Georgia despite the conclusion of peace remained tense In the spring of ARA American Relief Agency officials began to complain that Georgian officials who demanded a share of the provisions were holding up railway traffic carrying vital supplies of flour and other foodstuffs to Armenia Moved by their complaints and the debilitating food crisis in Armenia Georges Clemenceau as president of the Versailles Conference issued a carefully worded protest letter on July calling on the authorities in Georgia to cease further interference Georgia issued its own protest to this communiqu however by July American officials were already reporting that the rail traffic had begun to pick up
In autumn the two countries began negotiations for a new transit treaty which was concluded on In addition to this the parties also concluded an arbitration treaty whereby they agreed to settle their territorial disputes The treaties were acclaimed by the liberal and socialist press in both countries To blunt conservative criticism the Menshevik Bor'ba newspaper remarked that the transit treaty would give Georgia access to the markets of Persia and would yield a lucrative income in transportation fees All Georgian political observers agreed however that the immediate benefits would favour Armenia and that the Armenian government should reciprocate with a conciliatory attitude on other issues
A considerable degree of hostility existed between Armenia and its new neighbor to the east the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan stemming largely from racial religious cultural and societal differences The Azeris had close ethnic and religious ties to the Turks and had provided material support for them in their drive to Baku in Although the borders of the two countries were still undefined Azerbaijan claimed most of the territory Armenia was sitting on demanding all or most parts of the former Russian provinces of Elizavetpol Tiflis Yerevan Kars and Batum As diplomacy failed to accomplish compromise even with the mediation of the commanders of a British expeditionary force that had installed itself in the Caucasus territorial clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan took place throughout and most notably in the regions of Nakhichevan Karabakh and Syunik Zangezur Repeated attempts to bring these provinces under Azerbaijani jurisdiction were met with fierce resistance by their Armenian inhabitants In May Dro led an expeditionary unit that was successful in establishing Armenian administrative control in Nakhichevan albeit temporarily
While problems with Azerbaijan continued a new self proclaimed and unrecognized state headed by Fakhr al Din Pirioghlu and centered in Kars the South West Caucasian Republic was established It claimed the territory around the regions of Kars and Batum the Nakhichevan and Sharur districts of the Yerevan province and the Akhaltsikhe and Akhalkalaki districts of the Tiflis province It existed alongside the British general governorship created during the Entente's intervention in Transcaucasia It was abolished by British High Commissioner Admiral Somerset Arthur Gough Calthorpe in April and the entire Kars region was assigned to the Armenian Republic
The largest escalation of the Armenian Azerbaijani conflict occurred in mid March during the botched Karabakh uprising culminating in the massacre and expulsion of Shusha's majority Armenian population Through the area of Mountainous Karabakh was under the de facto administration of the local Armenian Karabakh Council which was supported by the region's overwhelmingly Armenian population During this period Azerbaijan several times attempted to assert its authority over the region backed by the British governor of Baku Lieutenant General Thomson who appointed Dr Khosrov bey Sultanov as governor general of Karabakh and Zangezur though Zangezur was never subjugated with the intention of bringing Karabakh under Azerbaijani subordination In under threat of extermination demonstrated by the Khaibalikend Massacre the Karabakh Council was forced to sign an agreement to recognise and submit to Azerbaijani jurisdiction until its status could be decided at the Paris Peace Conference
Ending early the Paris Peace Conference was inconclusive in the resolution of the Transcaucasian territorial disputes therefore the Armenian Republic by this time in a much stronger position to assert itself took it upon themselves to free the Karabakh Council from its callous Azerbaijani governor Subversive preparations began for a staged uprising in the region of the Karabakh Council timed to coincide with Azerbaijani Novruz celebrations The uprising due to its poor coordination was unsuccessful in ousting the Azerbaijani garrisons from Shusha and neighboring Khankend resulting in a pogrom against Shushi's majority Armenian population in which the Azerbaijani garrison and residents burned and looted half of the city
Following the uprising Armenian forces under the command of Garegin Nzhdeh and Dro Kanayan were dispatched by Yerevan to assist the Karabakh rebels at the same time Azerbaijan moved most of its army westward to break the Armenian resistance and its reinforcements despite the threat of the approaching th Red Army of Bolshevik Russia from the north By Azerbaijan's Sovietization barely a month after the uprising began Azerbaijani forces were able to maintain control over the central cities of Karabakh Shushi and Khankend whilst its immediate surroundings were firmly in the hands of Armenian villagers supplemented by the Armenian armed forces This situation persisted until the overwhelming Bolshevik army drove out the Armenian army detachments from the region after which the fears of the Armenians of Karabakh were alleviated by virtue of returning to the stability of Russian control
The Treaty of S vres was signed between the Allied and Associated Powers and Ottoman Empire at S vres France on August The treaty included a clause on Armenia it made all parties signing the treaty recognize Armenia as a free and independent state The drawing of definite borders was however left to President Woodrow Wilson and the United States State Department and was only presented to Armenia on November The new borders gave Armenia access to the Black Sea and awarded large portions of the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire to the republic
On September the Turkish General Kaz m Karabekir invaded the region of Sarikamish in an effort to retake land lost in the Treaty of S vres In response Armenia declared war on Turkey on September and the Turkish Armenian War began In the regions of Oltu Sarikamish Kars Alexandropol Gyumri Armenian forces clashed with those of Karabekir's XV Corps Fearful of possible Russian support for Armenia Mustafa Kemal Pasha had earlier sent several delegations to Moscow in search of an alliance finding a receptive response from the Soviet government which started sending gold and weapons to the Turkish revolutionaries This proved disastrous for the Armenians
The th Red Army began its virtually unopposed advance into Armenia on November The actual transfer of power took place on December in Yerevan The Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran Armenia decided to join the Soviet sphere while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army protect the Armenians and to not pursue non communist Armenians The final condition of this pledge was reneged on when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country following an attempted uprising
Armenia gave way to communist power in late In November the Turkish revolutionaries captured Alexandropol and were poised to move in on the capital A ceasefire was concluded on November Negotiations were then carried out between Karabekir and a peace delegation led by Alexander Khatisian in Alexandropol although Karabekir's terms were extremely harsh the Armenian delegation had little recourse but to agree to them The Treaty of Alexandropol was thus signed on December
On December the Armenian Revolutionary Committee Revkom made up of mostly Armenians from Azerbaijan also entered the city Finally on the following day December Felix Dzerzhinsky's Cheka entered Yerevan thus effectively ending the existence of the First Republic of Armenia At that point what was left of Armenia was under the influence of the Bolsheviks The part occupied by Turkey remained for the most part theirs as laid out in the terms of the subsequent Treaty of Kars Soon the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed under the leadership of Aleksandr Myasnikyan It was to be included in the newly created Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic
The Sardarapat Memorial at the site of the Battle of Sardarabad is the symbol of the First Republic Every year on May Armenia's political leadership and thousands of ordinary people visit the memorial to celebrate the foundation of Armenian statehood
In his Antranik of Armenia short story Armenian American writer William Saroyan writes about the First Republic of Armenia It was a small nation of course a very unimportant nation surrounded on all sides by enemies but for two years Armenia was Armenia and the capital was Erivan For the first time in thousands of years Armenia was Armenia
