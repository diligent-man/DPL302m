Limoges (/lɪˈmoʊʒ/, US also /liːˈ-/, French: [limɔʒ] (listen); Occitan: Lemòtges, locally Limòtges [liˈmɔdzes]) is a city and commune, and the prefecture of the Haute-Vienne department in west-central France
It was the administrative capital of the former Limousin region
Situated on the first western foothills of the Massif Central, Limoges is crossed by the river Vienne, of which it was originally the first ford crossing point.
The second most populated town in the New Aquitaine region after Bordeaux, a university town, an administrative centre and intermediate services with all the facilities of a regional metropolis, it has an urban area of 323,789 inhabitants in 2018
The inhabitants of the city are called the Limougeauds.
Founded around 10 BC under the name of Augustoritum, it became an important Gallo-Roman city
During the Middle Ages Limoges became a large city, strongly marked by the cultural influence of the Abbey of Saint-Martial, where the Dukes of Aquitaine were invested and crowned
From the 12th century onwards, its enamels were exported throughout the Christian world
In 1765, during the industrial revolution, the discovery of a deposit of kaolin in the Saint-Yrieix-la-Perche region enabled the development of the Limoges porcelain industry
It is sometimes nicknamed "the red city" or "the Rome of socialism" because of its tradition of voting on the left and the workers' events it experienced from the 19th to the beginning of the 20th century.
Since the 1990s, the city has had a basketball club, Limoges CSP, which has won several French championships and the European championship in 1993
Because of its heritage policy, it has held the label "City of Art and History" since 2008
Economic activities include butchering, electrical equipment for the building industry, and luxury goods
It is home to porcelain houses and art workshops working with enamel or stained glass
This specialty led it to join the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in 2017 in the thematic category "Crafts and Popular Arts".
Scarce remains of pre-urban settlements have been found in the area of Limoges
The capital of the Gaulish people of the Lemovices, who lived in the area, was probably either near Villejoubert, some kilometres south-east of Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat, or St Gence, just west of Limoges.
The city proper was founded as Augustoritum by the Romans, around 10 BC: "rito-" is Gaulish for "ford"
The foundation was part of the reorganization of the province by the emperor Augustus, hence the new name
The Roman city included an amphitheatre measuring 136 x 115 metres, a theatre, a forum, baths and several sanctuaries
According to tradition, a temple consecrated to Venus, Diana, Minerva and Jupiter was located near the modern cathedral
The city was on the typical Roman square plan, with two main streets crossing in the centre
It had a Senate and a currency of its own, a sign of its importance in the imperial age
Later, like many towns and cities in Gaul, it was renamed after the tribe (here the Lemovices) whose chief town it was; "Lemovices" subsequently evolved into "Limoges", and "Lemovicinus" for the area around changed into "Limousin".
Limoges was evangelized by Saint Martial, who came to the city around 250 with two companions, Alpinianus and Austriclinienus
However, in the late 3rd century it was increasingly abandoned, due to unsafe conditions created by the invasions of various Germanic tribes
The population was concentrated instead in a more easily fortifiable site, the modern Puy Saint-Étienne, which is the centre of the modern Limoges
Starting from the construction of the Abbey of St
Martial (9th century), another settlement grew around the tomb of the saint, while a third area, next to the residence of the viscount (the future Castle of Saint Martial), seems to have been populated from the 10th century.
Starting from the 11th century, thanks to the presence of the Abbey of St
Martial and its large library, Limoges became a flourishing artistic centre
It was home to an important school of medieval music composition, which is usually called the St
Martial School; its most famous member was the 13th-century troubadour Bertran de Born.
In the 13th century, at the peak of its splendour, central Limoges consisted of two fortified settlements.
The town proper, with a new line of walls encompassing the Vienne River, inhabited mainly by clerks and workers
It has a bridge on the Vienne river named after Saint-Étienne, built by the bishops, and a developed port
Sacked in 1370, it never recovered entirely.
The castle, with 12 meter-high walls, including the abbey and controlled by the abbot, sometimes in contrast with the bishop-ruled town ("la Cité")
Traces of the walls can still be seen in the city centre
 Outside the lines of walls were the popular quarters.In 1370, Limoges was occupied by Edward, the Black Prince, who massacred some 300 residents, "perhaps a sixth of the normal population", with another 60 members of the garrison of 140 dead as well.
The porcelain industry started to develop, favoured by the presence of kaolinite which was discovered near Limoges in 1768 (near St Yrieix, south-west of Limoges)
Many of the inhabitants became employed in the new sector or in connected activities (including the lumbering of wood needed for firing the porcelain) in manufacture and exporting needed for European distribution of Limoges Boxes, dinnerware, and other porcelain wares
Because the Limousin region has had a long history of breeding (Baronet sheep and Limousine cows), the leather industry also settled in and around Limoges along the banks of the Vienne–the river providing the necessary water and power
Factories in Limoges and St Junien still produce luxury leather shoes, gloves, and bags.
The city and castle were united in 1792 to form the single city of Limoges
During the French Revolution several religious edifices, considered symbols of the Ancien Régime, were destroyed by the population: these included the Abbey of St
Martial itself.
In the 19th century Limoges saw strong construction activity, which included the destruction and rebuilding of much of the city centre
The unsafe conditions of the poorer population is highlighted by the outbreak of several riots, including that of July–November 1830 and April 1848
The first French confederation of workers, Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) (General Confederation of Labour), was created in Limoges in 1895.
In early 1905, strikes began in another local industry, shoe factories soon followed in the porcelain factories
Barricades were built, the army intervened
There would be two casualties: a horse and a young porcelain worker, Camille Vardelle.
During World War II, many Jews from Alsace were evacuated to and around Limoges.
Limoges experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb) common to much of Western France
Most precipitation occurs between October and February
On 27 December 1999, winds reached 148 km/h
On average, the city undergoes 41 days of frost and seven days of snow each winter
In June, July and August, precipitation tends to come only from violent thunderstorms coming from the Bay of Biscay.
