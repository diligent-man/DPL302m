helorus heloros helorum or elorus greek or ptol steph
or scyl italian eloro was an ancient greek city of sicily situated near the east coast about km south of syracuse and on the banks of the river of the same name
it is currently an archaeological site in the modern comune of noto
we have no account of its origin but it was probably a colony of syracuse of which it appears to have continued always a dependency
the name is first found in scylax for though thucydides repeatedly mentions the road leading to helorus from syracuse which was that followed by the athenians in their disastrous retreat he never speaks of the town itself
it was one of the cities which remained the under the government of hieron ii by the treaty concluded with him by the romans in bce and having during the second punic war declared in favor of the carthaginians was recovered by marcus claudius marcellus in bce
under the romans it appears to have been dependent on syracuse and had perhaps no separate municipal existence though in a passage of cicero it appears to be noticed as a civitas
its name is again mentioned by the orator id
as a maritime town where the squadron fitted out by verres was attacked by pirates but it does not occur in pliny s list of the towns of sicily though he elsewhere mentions it as a castellum on the river of the same name and ptolemy speaks of a city of helorus
its ruins were still visible in the days of fazello a little to the north of the river helorus and about a mile from the sea coast
the most conspicuous of them were the remains of a theatre called by the country people colisseo but great part of the walls and other buildings could be traced
the extent of them was however inconsiderable
these are now said to have disappeared but there still remains between this site and the sea a curious column or monument built of large stones rising on a square pedestal
this is commonly regarded as a kind of trophy erected by the syracusans to commemorate their victory over the athenians
but there is no foundation for this belief had it been so designed it would certainly have been erected on the banks of the river asinarus which the athenians never succeeded in crossing
