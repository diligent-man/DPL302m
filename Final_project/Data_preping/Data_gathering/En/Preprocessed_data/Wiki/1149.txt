Presidential election occurred in the backdrop of the Progressive achievements of US
President Theodore Roosevelt's second term as well as against the US
In this election Roosevelt's chosen successor Republican William Howard Taft ran in large part on Roosevelt's Progressive legacy and decisively defeated former Congressman and three-time Democratic US
Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan who also advocated progressive ideas in his campaign
Overall the presidential campaign and election were about labor issues trusts campaign finance reform imperialism and corruption
Democrat Alton Parker's defeat at the hands of President Theodore Roosevelt who succeeded William McKinley after his assassination in gave William Jennings Bryan the and Democratic presidential nominee an opening to reassert his leadership in the Democratic Party
Bryan also was helped by newspaper tycoon and contender William Randolph Hearst's loss in the New York mayoral election which hurt Hearst's chances to get the Democratic presidential nomination
Bryan's most formidable challenger was Minnesota Governor John Albert Johnson
Johnson's rags-to-riches story honesty reformist credentials and ability to win in a heavily Republican US
state made him popular within the Democratic Party
Johnson ultimately was unable to overcome Bryan and by the end of June Bryan had the two-thirds of the delegates needed to win the nomination
At the Democratic National Convention Johnson who had no chance at the nomination by then released his delegates to Bryan helping Bryan to win the nomination on the first ballot with votes to votes for other favorite son candidates
For Bryan's vice presidential running mate the convention delegates selected John W
Kern a former state senator - and two-time gubernatorial candidate and later US
In response to Bryan's and Kern's nomination The New York Times disparagingly pointed out that the Democratic national ticket was consistent because a man twice defeated for the Presidency was at the head of it and a man twice defeated for governor of his state in and was at the tail of it
During the campaign the fact that this was Bryan's third Democratic presidential nomination was mocked by Republicans
Specifically Republicans told voters to vote for Taft now because they could vote for Bryan anytime
The Democratic platform criticized corporate power at the expense of the people as well as the increased number of federal officeholders and expenditures—the heedless waste of the people's money—and demanded the strictest economy in every department compatible with frugal and efficient administration In addition the Democrats condemned the arbitrary power of the Republican US
House Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon of Illinois as well as the use of patronage by President Roosevelt to nominate one of his Cabinet officers Taft as his successor
Due to Bryan's efforts a plank in the platform called for federal legislation requiring the publication of campaign contributions limiting the amount that individuals could donate and banning contributions from business corporations via their officers the last punishable by imprisonment
The platform reiterated the party's longstanding support of tariff reform and welcomed Republicans' tardy recognition of the righteousness of the Democratic position
Labeling private monopoly indefensible and intolerable the trusts plank advocated three laws banning directors from sitting on the board of more than one competing business federal licensing of any corporation before it could control of a market and prohibiting control of over market-share of an American-consumed product and requiring corporations to sell to all purchasers on the same terms except for transportation costs
At Bryan's urging his previous endorsement of government ownership of railroads was omitted from the platform
The Democratic platform nevertheless advocated regulatory authority for the Interstate Commerce Commission emergency currency issued and controlled by the Federal Government and an income tax on individuals and corporations
Accepting most of the demands of Samuel Gompers the President of the American Federation of Labor the Democrats criticized the unfair use of injunctions against striking workers affirmed the right of labor to organize and not be charged with restraining trade and favored an eight-hour workday for federal employees a general employers' liability law and a separate Department of Labor
Also the Democrats advocated in support of a homestead law for Hawaii territorial governments for Alaska and Puerto Rico independence for the Philippines once a stable government was established and a ban on Asian immigration to the United States
Unlike in and Bryan did not advocate in favor of free silver in believing this issue to be dead
Rather Bryan focused on labor issues trusts campaign finance reform and imperialism during his campaign
As in and Bryan ran an active and energetic campaign and delivered speeches throughout the North and West
Of the days that Bryan spent on the campaign trail half were spent in the Midwest in New York in other Eastern states and the remaining days in the Plains States and Colorado
Meanwhile vice-presidential nominee Kern focused on campaigning in the South
As in and Bryan attracted large crowds and gave numerous speeches each day including a record-breaking
Due to his older age Bryan became more exhausted as a result of giving so many speeches than he was back in and
While he expected to lose New England and the West Coast Bryan expected to hold the South and Rocky Mountain States as he did in both and
Late in the campaign Bryan was hurt by his ties with Democratic National Committee treasurer and Oklahoma Governor Charles Haskell
William Randolph Hearst revealed that both Haskell and Ohio Republican US
Senator Joseph Foraker accepting bribes in an attempt to stop the antitrust suit against the Standard Oil Company
While Taft quickly cut off all of his ties with Senator Foraker Bryan refused to do the same with Governor Haskell due to his refusal to believe the charges against Haskell
President Roosevelt called Bryan's association with and support of Haskell a scandal and disgrace
Taft defeated Bryan by a two-to-one to margin in the Electoral College and by a to margin in the popular vote
Bryan did worse in than he did in both and carrying only the South Oklahoma Colorado and Nevada Bryan also won of electors in Maryland while losing the state to Taft by less than
Bryan won no crucial states and only won two large cities Kansas City and New Orleans
Taft did well in the more urban Northeast the Midwest and the Pacific Coast
While Bryan lost the election Democrats picked up eight seats in the US
House of Representatives gained strength in most state legislatures and won governorships in five states that Taft carried that year
In addition to this and despite Bryan's loss many of his proposed reforms from eventually become law such as the direct election of senators a federal income tax and the government guarantee of bank deposits
