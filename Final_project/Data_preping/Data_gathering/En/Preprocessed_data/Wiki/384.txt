In early January Iain Chapman launched the digiNEWS website providing news rumours and information on Sky's new digital satellite platform SkyDigital
At the same time Chris Butcher launched the ONfaq website offering similar news and information on the UK's new digital terrestrial platform ONdigital
Both sites proved to be popular attracting a lot of attention from visitors eager for more news about these rapidly developing TV platforms
Very soon Chapman and Butcher discussed the idea of a merger of the two sites to create the digiNEWS Network
On February digiNEWS and ONfaq merged and were rebranded as sites of the new 'digiNEWS network'
More websites joined the network including Chris Norris's cablenewsuk covering NTL and TeleWest cable services Mark Hughes' DVDNews DVD news and reviews and Neil Wilkes' TVuk TV news and gossip
While the network grew it was still served from personal webspace from ISPs such as Freeserve so discussions with website guru Jose Cardoso began and work started on integrating the multitude of sites into a single portal
It was important for the new site to be easily accessible so a COM address was preferable but the diginewscom address was already taken
After many many emails back and forth the name 'Digital Spy' was chosen

On March Digital Spy announced on its site that they would be closing their non-entertainment related discussion forums such as Politics and General Discussion forums and mainly retaining Film Entertainment and Television based ones that same week in an effort to refocus its website no confirmed date was given for the changes but the closure then occurred suddenly hours later
