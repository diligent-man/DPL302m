the pudgalav da sanskrit english personalism pali puggalav da chinese pinyin b t ji lu l nzh was a buddhist philosophical view and also refers to a group of nikaya buddhist schools mainly known as v ts putr yas that arose from the sthavira nik ya
the school is believed to have been founded by the elder v ts putra in the third century bce
they were a widely influential school in india and became particularly popular during the reign of emperor harshavadana ce
harsha s sister rajyasri was said to have joined the school as a nun
according to dan lusthaus they were one of the most popular mainstream buddhist sects in india for more than a thousand years
the pudgalav dins asserted that while there is no tman there exists a pudgala person or sattva being which is neither a conditioned dharma nor an unconditioned dharma
this doctrine of the person was their method of accounting for karma rebirth and nirvana
for the pudgalav dins the pudgala was what underwent rebirth through successive lives in samsara and what experiences nirvana
they defended this view through philosophical argument as well as scriptural citation
according to thi n ch u and richard gombrich they used the bharaharasutta as a major reference for their view
this text states that the person pudgala is the bearer of the five aggregates and that the taking up of them is craving and suffering
the kathavatthu also mentions that the pudgalav dins relied on the following statements by the buddha there is a person who exerts for his own good and there appears a person who is reborn for the good and happiness of many for showing compassion to the world of beings
the pudgalav dins held that this person was inexpressible and indeterminate in its relation to the five aggregates and could not be said to be neither the same as the aggregates nor different
however the person could not be denied entirely for if this were so nothing would get reborn and nothing would be the object of loving kindness meditation
thus according to l s
cousins the difference is that for the voidist the person is a label for the aggregates experiences as objects of consciousness whereas for the personalist the relationship between the person and those objects cannot be described as either the same nor different thus this pudgala was the subject of experiences the doer of wholesome and unwholesome actions and the experiencer of karma transmigration and nirvana
yet it was also indefinable avaktavya neither a conditioned samskrta nor an unconditioned dharma nirvana and neither the same as nor different from the five aggregates
however as thi n ch u notes in his survey of their literature the pudgalav dins carefully developed this theory especially to be compatible with anatman and the middle way and thus the pudgala is not an absolute reality totally separated from compounded things
the abhidharmakosha shows how the pudgalavadins explained their theory by using the analogy of fire and fuel
the five aggregates are the fuel and the pudgala the fire
the fire exists as long as there is fuel but it is not the same as the fuel and has properties that the fuel does not
they are co existent and the fuel aggregates are the support for the fire pudgala and thus are not the same nor wholly different
for the pudgalavadins if one says that the person is the same as the aggregates the reductionist buddhist view of other schools this is like saying fire and fuel are the same thing which is one mistake
on the other hand if one says that fire and fuel are totally different this is like saying fire does not depend on fuel a second mistake related to non buddhist views
thus they took a middle road between these and argued for a person which is neither identical to the aggregates nor different from them
they sought to refute the view of other buddhists that the aggregates and the person were the same
they held that at death when the aggregates are destroyed the person would then also be destroyed thus not be reborn
they also believed it contradicted the buddha s words i e
the bearer of the burden exists
the kathavatthu also mentions that the pudgala can be likened to what is called a being sattva and also to what is called jiva life force but that it is neither identical nor different from the body kaya
one pudgalavadin text explains the nature of this relationship as being based on clinging or appropriation upadana the designation of appropriation upadana praj apti is the designation of life jiva which is internal appropriation upadana in the present and is composed of the aggregates skandha elements dhatu and domains ayatana that is to say that the phenomena of appropriation concerning the internal life in the present which is formed by compounded things samskara and the fetters is what is called the designation of appropriation the pudgalav dins also seem to have held that the liberated person exists even after paranirvana in a state of supreme bliss or as thi n ch u notes they saw nirvana as a transcendental domain and an existence in the beyond
according to the pudgalav din text known as the traidharmakasastra the pudgala can be designated in three ways called the three praj aptis
the pudgala designated by the bases asraya praji apta pudgala
this refers to the person which cannot be said to be identical to the aggregates or different to them
thich thien chau names this as the essential factor that unifies a person s life processes
stated otherwise it is the pudgala that appropriates and sustains a body for a certain amount of time
the pudgala designated by transmigration sankrama praji apta pudgala refers to the fact that an individual cannot be said to be the same nor different to who they were in a past life and will be in the future
this allows for a subject which is karmically responsible for their actions
according to the pudgalavadins if there is a continuity in between lifetimes there must be the possessor of that continuity as well as that which individuates a person from others and is the subject of experiences this is the pudgala
the pudgala designated by cessation nirodha praji apta pudgala which refers to the fact that after death a buddha cannot be said to be existent non existent both or neither
regarding the first form of designation dan lusthaus adds that if the appropriator is something different from the skandhas themselves then there is a sixth skandha which is doctrinally impermissible
if the skandhas appropriate themselves that leads to a vicious cycle of infinite regress
hence the v ts putr ya argue the nominal person pudgala is neither the same as nor different from the skandhas
it is a heuristic fiction that avoids these unwarranted consequences and lends coherence by also corresponding to how actual persons experience themselves that is as distinct individuals continuous with but not absolutely identical to or reducible to their own pasts and futures lusthaus also explains their reasoning for the second and third designations as follows but what remains constant or continuous between such past and future lives if it is a self same invariant identity then this would indeed be a case of atmavada a view the v ts putr yas like all buddhists reject
in what sense would someone be the same or different from the person in one s previous life if completely different then to posit a continuity between them is incoherent
if the same then their real discontinuities are ignored leading to a form of eternalism another impermissible view for buddhists
hence they are neither the same nor different but linked by a fictional pudgala
finally buddhist practice leads to nirvana but who attains this if there is an integral individual that ceases on attaining nirvana then this would entail the unwarranted view of annihilationalism
if there is no cessation of the karmic individual then there is no nirvana
both extremes though implicit in standard buddhist formulations render buddhism itself incoherent a problem only solved the v ts putr yas argue if one admits the fictional pudgala implicit in standard buddhist doctrine with this system pudgalav dins held that they could explain karmic moral retribution and personal identity by positing an ineffable avaktavya dharma that avoids falling into the extremes of annihilation ucceda and eternity sasvata
one pudgalavada text affirms that this doctrine is a middle way thus if the pudgala could be described in terms of existence or non existence one would fall into nihilism ucchedadristi or eternalism sasvatadrsti but the buddha does not allow us to uphold there two opinions
if one says that the pudgala does not exist that is committing a fault in the order of the questions to be avoided
that expression is not justified
why if one affirms that no pudgala exists that is a fake view mithyadrsti
if on the contrary one affirms that the pudgala exists conditionally that is a right view samyagdrsti
that is why it is possible to say that the pudgala exists because they felt that v ts putr ya views were close to the view of a self or atman they were sharply criticized by the vibhajjavadins a record of this is found in the theravadin kathavatthu as well as by the sarvastivadins in the vij anakaya sautrantikas most famously in the abhidharmakosha and the madhyamaka school candrakirti s madhyamakavatara
the earliest source for the pudgala doctrinal controversy is the puggalakatha of the kathavatthu attributed to moggaliputtatissa c
third century bce
the buddhist philosopher vasubandhu argued against the pudgala theory in his abhidharmakosha
vasubandhu begins by stating that the v ts putr ya hold that the pudgala is based on the five aggregates and that this could mean one of two things
the five aggregates form an object the pudgala
in this case pudgala is just a nominal designation for the five aggregates and not an independent object
the pudgala is caused by the aggregates
in this case pudgala also refers to just the aggregates and not to something else independent of them vasubandhu argues then that pudgala is identical to the aggregates and just a label for them
vasubandhu first argues that we can either perceive the pudgala directly or perceive it by perceiving the aggregates
if the latter then its just a label for aggregates
if we perceive it directly then the aggregates would be based on the pudgala not the other way around
vasubandhu also attacks the view that we can perceive the pudgala by all six senses
if this is true then the pudgala is nothing but the five aggregates since all that the senses perceive is their direct sense impressions and nothing more
according to thich thien chau other secondary theses of the personalist v ts putr ya sa mit yas include
there exists an indestructible entity avipranasa
this helps explain the mechanism for the retribution of actions
the indestructible entity continues to exist throughout the flux of existences and is the essential base for the accumulation and maturation of karma
there are twelve knowledges on the path of seeing darsanamarga
there are four stages in the concentration of access patience ksanti name nama notion samj a and the highest worldly dharma laukikagradharma
clear comprehension abhisamaya is gradual anupurva
the five supernormal penetrations can be obtained by ordinary beings or heretics
morality sila designates actions of body and speech
merit punya is accumulated continually even during sleep
it is impossible to say whether the characteristic of phenomena dharmalabana is permanence or impermanence
there is an intermediate dhyana dhyanantara between the first and second dhyanas
there is only one absolute asamskrta dharma nirvana
there are five six or seven destinies gati
knowledge j ana also can be called the path marga
an arahant is susceptible of falling from his attainment
there is an intermediate state antarabhava in the sensuous realm kamadhatu and the form realm rupadhatu but not in the formless realm arupadhatu
there are seventeen categories of celestial beings in the form realmthe school had a tripitaka with sutra pitaka in four agamas vinaya pitaka and abhidharma pitakas like other early buddhist schools
only four of their texts survive in chinese translation
the san fa tu lun traidharmakasastra taisho xxv
the ssu a han mu ch ao chieh taisho xxv
the san mi ti pu lun sammatiyanikayasastra taisho xxxii
the lu erh shih erh ming liao lun vinayadvavimsati vidyasastra taisho xxiv
one surviving pudgalavada text is the traidharmakasastra taisho no
pp c a an abhidharma work which was translated twice into chinese
the text mentions that lack of knowledge also includes lack of knowledge of the indefinable avaktavya which refers to the pudgala
another pudgalavada text the sammatiyanikayasastra put forth various arguments for and against the following propositions
there is no self
self neither exists nor does not exist
self exists
self is the same as the five aggregates
self is different than the five aggregates
self is eternal
self is not eternalall of these views are ultimately rejected
the text claims that the pudgala is neither an existent nor a purely conceptual construct
peter harvey agrees with criticisms leveled against the pudgalavadins by moggaliputta tissa and vasubandhu and finds that there is no support in the pali nikayas for their pudgala concept
however according to bhiksu thi n ch u the creation of the theory of the pudgala represents a reaction against the depersonalization of the abhidharmika tradition
the pudgalavadins on the other hand tried to preserve the essence of the doctrine of substancelessness anatmavada
the theory of the pudgala has been misinterpreted by the polemical literature nevertheless it offers much of doctrinal interest to buddhist thinkers furthermore thi n ch u in his analysis of their doctrine adds the pudgalavadins were probably not satisfied with the interpretation according to which a man is merely the result of a combination of psych physical factors
for a man is something different from a chariot the latter is only an assemblage of parts and separate pieces whereas the former is essentially a being with its totality of which the psycho physical parts develop after conception and birth according to dan lusthaus no buddhist school has been more vilified by its buddhist peers or misunderstood by modern scholars
lusthaus argues that far from promoting the view of a self atmavada the v ts putr ya position which can be seen in their surviving texts is that the pudgala is a praj apti only a nominal existent that is neither identical to nor different from the skandhas furthermore the v ts putr ya argument is that the pudgala is a necessary praj apti since any theory of karma or any theory that posits that individuals can make spiritual progress for themselves or can assist other individuals to do likewise is incoherent without it
karma means that an action done at one time has subsequent consequences for the same individual at a later time or even a later life
if the positive and negative consequences of an action don t accrue to the self same individual then it would make no sense to speak of things like progress who is progressing and buddhist practice itself becomes incoherent
if there are no persons then there is no one who suffers no one who performs and reaps the consequences of his or her own karma no buddha no buddhists and no buddhism
obviously those are not acceptable consequences for a buddhist lusthaus notes that for the v ts putr yas their theory is simply an attempt to explain what other buddhist traditions leave unsaid and assumed mainly what it is that undergoes rebirth has moral responsibility and attains enlightenment
according to lusthaus for the v ts putr yas while other buddhists might leave the word pudgala unsaid the narratives presupposed in their doctrines require it
according to thi n ch u the v ts putr yas were the initial parent school out of which branched off four sub schools sometime between the st century bce and the st century ce mainly the sa mit yas dhammuttariyas bhadrayanikas and the sandagarikas
the v ts putr ya communities were established in kosambi and sarnath living side by side with the sa mit yas a school which quickly eclipsed them in popularity
the most prominent of the pudgalav din schools were certainly the sa mit yas sanskrit chinese pinyin zh ngli ng b who were especially prominent in sindh and in gujarat during the maitraka dynasty ce
inscriptions have also established the existence of sa mit ya communities in mathura and sarnath between the nd and th centuries ce
the tibetan historian buton rinchen drub noted that the sa mit ya used apabhra a as their main language
by the fourth century ce this school had become so influential that they replaced the sarvastivadins in sarnath as the most prominent school
by the time of king harsha in the seventh century they were the largest nikaya buddhist school in india
due to their geographic spread this led to them being divided into two further sub schools the avantakas centered in avanti and the kurukulas centered around kuru on the upper ganges
their most influential center of learning was at valabhi university in gujarat which remained an important place for the study of nikaya buddhism until the th century ce
i tsing who visited gujarat in ce noted that the sammitiyas had the greatest number of followers in western india and that the learning center at valabhi rivaled that of nalanda
tienne lamotte using the writings of the chinese traveler xuanzang asserted that the sa mit ya were in all likelihood the most populous non mah y na sect in india comprising double the number of the next largest sect although scholar l
cousins revised his estimate down to a quarter of all non mah y na monks still the largest overall
the sa mit ya sect seems to have been particularly strong in the sindh where one scholar estimates buddhist monasteries were sa mit ya of a total of
this area was rapidly islamized in the wake of the arab conquest
they continued to be a presence in india until the end of indian buddhism but never having gained a foothold elsewhere did not continue thereafter
ancient sources such as xuanzang and tibetan historian t ran tha reported that the sa mit yas were staunch opponents of mah y na
according to t ran tha sa mit ya monks from the sindh burned tantric scriptures and destroyed a silver image of hevajra at vajr sana monastery in bodh gaya
in the biography of xuanzang it is recounted that an elderly brahmin and follower of the sa mit ya sect named praj gupta composed a treatise in verses which opposed the mah y na teachings
in response while living at n land xuanzang wrote a sanskrit work in verses to refute this text called the destruction of heresy
