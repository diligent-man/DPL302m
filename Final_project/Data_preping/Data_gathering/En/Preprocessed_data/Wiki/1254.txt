The Pudgalavāda Sanskrit English Personalism Pali Puggalavāda Chinese pinyin Bǔtèjiāluō Lùnzhě was a Buddhist philosophical view and also refers to a group of Nikaya Buddhist schools mainly known as Vātsīputrīyas that arose from the Sthavira nikāya The school is believed to have been founded by the elder Vātsīputra in the third century BCE They were a widely influential school in India and became particularly popular during the reign of emperor Harshavadana CE Harsha's sister Rajyasri was said to have joined the school as a nun According to Dan Lusthaus they were one of the most popular mainstream Buddhist sects in India for more than a thousand years
The Pudgalavādins asserted that while there is no ātman there exists a pudgala person or sattva being which is neither a conditioned dharma nor an unconditioned dharma This doctrine of the person was their method of accounting for karma rebirth and nirvana For the Pudgalavādins the pudgala was what underwent rebirth through successive lives in samsara and what experiences nirvana They defended this view through philosophical argument as well as scriptural citation According to Thiện Châu and Richard Gombrich they used the Bharaharasutta as a major reference for their view This text states that the person pudgala is the bearer of the five aggregates and that the taking up of them is craving and suffering
The Kathavatthu also mentions that the Pudgalavādins relied on the following statements by the Buddha there is a person who exerts for his own good and there appears a person who is reborn for the good and happiness of many for showing compassion to the world of beings The Pudgalavādins held that this person was inexpressible and indeterminate in its relation to the five aggregates and could not be said to be neither the same as the aggregates nor different However the person could not be denied entirely for if this were so nothing would get reborn and nothing would be the object of loving kindness meditation Thus according to LS CousinsThe difference is that for the Voidist the person is a label for the aggregates experiences as objects of consciousness whereas for the personalist the relationship between the person and those objects cannot be described as either the same nor differentThus this pudgala was the subject of experiences the doer of wholesome and unwholesome actions and the experiencer of karma transmigration and nirvana Yet it was also indefinable avaktavya neither a conditioned samskrta nor an unconditioned dharma nirvana and neither the same as nor different from the five aggregates However as Thiện Châu notes in his survey of their literature the Pudgalavādins carefully developed this theory especially to be compatible with anatman and the middle way and thus the pudgala is not an absolute reality totally separated from compounded things
The Abhidharmakosha shows how the Pudgalavadins explained their theory by using the analogy of fire and fuel The five aggregates are the fuel and the pudgala the fire The fire exists as long as there is fuel but it is not the same as the fuel and has properties that the fuel does not They are co existent and the fuel aggregates are the support for the fire pudgala and thus are not the same nor wholly different For the Pudgalavadins If one says that the person is the same as the aggregates the reductionist Buddhist view of other schools this is like saying fire and fuel are the same thing which is one mistake On the other hand if one says that fire and fuel are totally different this is like saying fire does not depend on fuel a second mistake related to non Buddhist views Thus they took a middle road between these and argued for a person which is neither identical to the aggregates nor different from them They sought to refute the view of other Buddhists that the aggregates and the person were the same They held that at death when the aggregates are destroyed the person would then also be destroyed thus not be reborn They also believed it contradicted the Buddha's words ie the bearer of the burden exists
The Kathavatthu also mentions that the pudgala can be likened to what is called a being sattva and also to what is called jiva life force but that it is neither identical nor different from the body kaya One Pudgalavadin text explains the nature of this relationship as being based on clinging or appropriation upadanaThe designation of appropriation upadana prajñapti is the designation of life jiva which is internal appropriation upadana in the present and is composed of the aggregates skandha elements dhatu and domains ayatana that is to say that the phenomena of appropriation concerning the internal life in the present which is formed by compounded things samskara and the fetters is what is called the designation of appropriationThe Pudgalavādins also seem to have held that the liberated person exists even after paranirvana in a state of supreme bliss or as Thiện Châu notes they saw nirvana as a transcendental domain and an existence in the beyond
According to the Pudgalavādin text known as the Traidharmakasastra the pudgala can be designated in three ways called the three prajñaptis
The pudgala designated by the bases asraya prajiñapta pudgala This refers to the person which cannot be said to be identical to the aggregates or different to them Thich Thien Chau names this as the essential factor that unifies a person's life processes Stated otherwise it is the pudgala that appropriates and sustains a body for a certain amount of time
The pudgala designated by transmigration sankrama prajiñapta pudgala refers to the fact that an individual cannot be said to be the same nor different to who they were in a past life and will be in the future This allows for a subject which is karmically responsible for their actions According to the Pudgalavadins if there is a continuity in between lifetimes there must be the possessor of that continuity as well as that which individuates a person from others and is the subject of experiences this is the pudgala
The pudgala designated by cessation nirodha prajiñapta pudgala which refers to the fact that after death a Buddha cannot be said to be existent non existent both or neither
Regarding the first form of designation Dan Lusthaus adds thatIf the appropriator is something different from the skandhas themselves then there is a sixth skandha which is doctrinally impermissible If the skandhas appropriate themselves that leads to a vicious cycle of infinite regress Hence the Vātsīputrīya argue the nominal person pudgala is neither the same as nor different from the skandhas It is a heuristic fiction that avoids these unwarranted consequences and lends coherence by also corresponding to how actual persons experience themselves—that is as distinct individuals continuous with but not absolutely identical to or reducible to their own pasts and futuresLusthaus also explains their reasoning for the second and third designations as followsBut what remains constant or continuous between such past and future lives If it is a self same invariant identity then this would indeed be a case of atmavada a view the Vātsīputrīyas like all Buddhists reject In what sense would someone be the same or different from the person in one’s previous life If completely different then to posit a continuity between them is incoherent If the same then their real discontinuities are ignored leading to a form of eternalism another impermissible view for Buddhists Hence they are neither the same nor different but linked by a fictional pudgala Finally Buddhist practice leads to nirvana but who attains this If there is an integral individual that ceases on attaining nirvana then this would entail the unwarranted view of annihilationalism If there is no cessation of the karmic individual then there is no nirvana Both extremes though implicit in standard Buddhist formulations render Buddhism itself incoherent a problem only solved the Vātsīputrīyas argue if one admits the fictional pudgala implicit in standard Buddhist doctrineWith this system Pudgalavādins held that they could explain karmic moral retribution and personal identity by positing an ineffable avaktavya dharma that avoids falling into the extremes of annihilation ucceda and eternity sasvata One Pudgalavada text affirms that this doctrine is a middle way thusIf the pudgala could be described in terms of existence or non existence one would fall into nihilism ucchedadristi or eternalism sasvatadrsti but the Buddha does not allow us to uphold there two opinions If one says that the pudgala does not exist that is committing a fault in the order of the questions to be avoided That expression is not justified Why If one affirms that no pudgala exists that is a fake view mithyadrsti If on the contrary one affirms that the pudgala exists conditionally that is a right view samyagdrsti That is why it is possible to say that the pudgala existsBecause they felt that Vātsīputrīya views were close to the view of a self or atman they were sharply criticized by the Vibhajjavadins a record of this is found in the Theravadin Kathavatthu as well as by the Sarvastivadins In the Vijñanakaya Sautrantikas most famously in the Abhidharmakosha and the Madhyamaka school Candrakirti's Madhyamakavatara The earliest source for the pudgala doctrinal controversy is the puggalakatha of the Kathavatthu attributed to Moggaliputtatissa c third century BCE
The Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu argued against the pudgala theory in his Abhidharmakosha Vasubandhu begins by stating that the Vātsīputrīya hold that the pudgala 'is based' on the five aggregates and that this could mean one of two things
The five aggregates form an object the pudgala In this case pudgala is just a nominal designation for the five aggregates and not an independent object
The pudgala is caused by the aggregates In this case pudgala also refers to just the aggregates and not to something else independent of themVasubandhu argues then that 'pudgala' is identical to the aggregates and just a label for them Vasubandhu first argues that we can either perceive the pudgala directly or perceive it by perceiving the aggregates If the latter then its just a label for aggregates If we perceive it directly then the aggregates would be based on the pudgala not the other way around Vasubandhu also attacks the view that we can perceive the pudgala by all six senses If this is true then the pudgala is nothing but the five aggregates since all that the senses perceive is their direct sense impressions and nothing more
According to Thich Thien Chau other secondary theses of the personalist Vātsīputrīya Saṃmitīyas include
There exists an indestructible entity avipranasa This helps explain the mechanism for the retribution of actions The indestructible entity continues to exist throughout the flux of existences and is the essential base for the accumulation and maturation of karma
There are twelve knowledges on the path of seeing darsanamarga
There are four stages in the concentration of access patience ksanti name nama notion samjña and the highest worldly dharma laukikagradharma
The five supernormal penetrations can be obtained by ordinary beings or heretics
Morality Sila designates actions of body and speech
Merit punya is accumulated continually even during sleep
It is impossible to say whether the characteristic of phenomena dharmalabana is permanence or impermanence
There is an intermediate dhyana dhyanantara between the first and second dhyanas
There is only one absolute asamskrta dharma nirvana
There are five six or seven destinies gati
Knowledge jñana also can be called the path marga
An arahant is susceptible of falling from his attainment
There is an intermediate state antarabhava in the sensuous realm kamadhatu and the form realm rupadhatu but not in the formless realm arupadhatu
There are seventeen categories of celestial beings in the form realmThe school had a Tripitaka with Sutra Pitaka in four Agamas Vinaya Pitaka and Abhidharma Pitakas like other early Buddhist schools Only four of their texts survive in Chinese translation

Self neither exists nor does not exist
Self is the same as the five aggregates
Self is different than the five aggregates
Self is not eternalAll of these views are ultimately rejected The text claims that the pudgala is neither an existent nor a purely conceptual construct
Peter Harvey agrees with criticisms leveled against the Pudgalavadins by Moggaliputta Tissa and Vasubandhu and finds that there is no support in the Pali Nikayas for their pudgala concept
However according to Bhiksu Thiện ChâuThe creation of the theory of the pudgala represents a reaction against the depersonalization of the abhidharmika tradition The Pudgalavadins on the other hand tried to preserve the essence of the doctrine of substancelessness anatmavada The theory of the pudgala has been misinterpreted by the polemical literature nevertheless it offers much of doctrinal interest to Buddhist thinkersFurthermore Thiện Châu in his analysis of their doctrine addsThe Pudgalavadins were probably not satisfied with the interpretation according to which a man is merely the result of a combination of psychphysical factors For a man is something different from a chariot the latter is only an assemblage of parts and separate pieces whereas the former is essentially a being with its totality of which the psycho physical parts develop after conception and birthAccording to Dan Lusthaus no Buddhist school has been more vilified by its Buddhist peers or misunderstood by modern scholars Lusthaus argues that far from promoting the view of a self atmavada the Vātsīputrīya position which can be seen in their surviving texts is that the pudgala is a prajñapti only a nominal existent that is neither identical to nor different from the skandhas Furthermore The Vātsīputrīya argument is that the pudgala is a necessary prajñapti since any theory of karma or any theory that posits that individuals can make spiritual progress for themselves or can assist other individuals to do likewise is incoherent without it Karma means that an action done at one time has subsequent consequences for the same individual at a later time or even a later life If the positive and negative consequences of an action don’t accrue to the self same individual then it would make no sense to speak of things like progress who is progressing and Buddhist practice itself becomes incoherent If there are no persons then there is no one who suffers no one who performs and reaps the consequences of his or her own karma no Buddha no Buddhists and no Buddhism Obviously those are not acceptable consequences for a BuddhistLusthaus notes that for the Vātsīputrīyas their theory is simply an attempt to explain what other Buddhist traditions leave unsaid and assumed mainly what it is that undergoes rebirth has moral responsibility and attains enlightenment According to Lusthaus for the Vātsīputrīyas while other Buddhists might leave the word pudgala unsaid the narratives presupposed in their doctrines require it
According to Thiện Châu the Vātsīputrīyas were the initial parent school out of which branched off four sub schools sometime between the st century BCE and the st century CE mainly the Saṃmitīyas Dhammuttariyas Bhadrayanikas and the Sandagarikas The Vātsīputrīya communities were established in Kosambi and Sarnath living side by side with the Saṃmitīyas a school which quickly eclipsed them in popularity
The most prominent of the Pudgalavādin schools were certainly the Saṃmitīyas Sanskrit Chinese pinyin Zhèngliàng Bù who were especially prominent in Sindh and in Gujarat during the Maitraka dynasty CE Inscriptions have also established the existence of Saṃmitīya communities in Mathura and Sarnath between the nd and th centuries CE The Tibetan historian Buton Rinchen Drub noted that the Saṃmitīya used Apabhraṃśa as their main language By the fourth century CE this school had become so influential that they replaced the Sarvastivadins in Sarnath as the most prominent school By the time of king Harsha in the seventh century they were the largest Nikaya Buddhist school in India Due to their geographic spread this led to them being divided into two further sub schools the Avantakas centered in Avanti and the Kurukulas centered around Kuru on the upper Ganges
Their most influential center of learning was at Valabhi University in Gujarat which remained an important place for the study of Nikaya Buddhism until the th century CE I tsing who visited Gujarat in CE noted that the Sammitiyas had the greatest number of followers in western India and that the learning center at Valabhi rivaled that of Nalanda
Étienne Lamotte using the writings of the Chinese traveler Xuanzang asserted that the Saṃmitīya were in all likelihood the most populous non Mahāyāna sect in India comprising double the number of the next largest sect although scholar L S Cousins revised his estimate down to a quarter of all non Mahāyāna monks still the largest overall The Saṃmitīya sect seems to have been particularly strong in the Sindh where one scholar estimates Buddhist monasteries were Saṃmitīya of a total of This area was rapidly Islamized in the wake of the Arab conquest They continued to be a presence in India until the end of Indian Buddhism but never having gained a foothold elsewhere did not continue thereafter
Ancient sources such as Xuanzang and Tibetan historian Tāranātha reported that the Saṃmitīyas were staunch opponents of Mahāyāna According to Tāranātha Saṃmitīya monks from the Sindh burned tantric scriptures and destroyed a silver image of Hevajra at Vajrāsana monastery in Bodh Gaya In the biography of Xuanzang it is recounted that an elderly brahmin and follower of the Saṃmitīya sect named Prajñāgupta composed a treatise in verses which opposed the Mahāyāna teachings In response while living at Nālandā Xuanzang wrote a Sanskrit work in verses to refute this text called The Destruction of Heresy
