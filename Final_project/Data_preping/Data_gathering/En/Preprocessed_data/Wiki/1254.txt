pudgalavdins asserted tman exists pudgala person sattva neither conditioned dharma unconditioned dharma
doctrine person wa method accounting karma rebirth nirvana
pudgalavdins pudgala wa underwent rebirth successive life samsara experience nirvana
according thin chu richard gombrich used bharaharasutta major reference view
text state person pudgala bearer five aggregate taking craving suffering
kathavatthu also mention pudgalavdins relied following statement buddha person exerts good appears person reborn good happiness many showing compassion world beings
pudgalavdins held person wa inexpressible indeterminate relation five aggregate could said neither aggregate different
however person could denied entirely nothing would get reborn nothing would object loving-kindness meditation
cousinsthe difference voidist person label aggregate experience object consciousness whereas personalist relationship person object cannot described either differentthus pudgala wa subject experience doer wholesome unwholesome action experiencer karma transmigration nirvana
yet wa also indefinable avaktavya neither conditioned samskrta unconditioned dharma nirvana neither different five aggregates
however thin chu note survey literature pudgalavdins carefully developed theory especially compatible anatman middle way thus pudgala absolute reality totally separated compounded things
abhidharmakosha show pudgalavadins explained theory using analogy fire fuel
fire exists long fuel fuel ha property fuel doe not
co-existent fuel aggregate support fire pudgala thus wholly different
pudgalavadins one say person aggregate reductionist buddhist view school like saying fire fuel thing one mistake
hand one say fire fuel totally different like saying fire doe depend fuel second mistake related non-buddhist views
thus took middle road argued person neither identical aggregate different them
held death aggregate destroyed person would also destroyed thus reborn
kathavatthu also mention pudgala likened called sattva also called jiva life force neither identical different body kaya

pudgala designated cessation nirodha-prajiapta-pudgala refers fact death buddha cannot said existent non-existent neither
regarding first form designation dan lusthaus add thatif appropriator something different skandhas sixth skandha doctrinally impermissible
hence vtsputrya argue nominal person pudgala neither different skandhas
heuristic fiction avoids unwarranted consequence lends coherence also corresponding actual person experience themselvesthat distinct individual continuous absolutely identical reducible past futureslusthaus also explains reasoning second third designation followsbut remains constant continuous past future life self-same invariant identity would indeed case
sense would someone different person one previous life completely different posit continuity incoherent
real discontinuity ignored leading form eternalism another impermissible view buddhists
finally buddhist practice lead nirvana attains integral individual cease attaining nirvana would entail unwarranted view annihilationalism
extreme though implicit standard buddhist formulation render buddhism incoherent problem solved vtsputryas argue one admits fictional pudgala implicit standard buddhist doctrinewith system pudgalavdins held could explain karmic moral retribution personal identity positing ineffable avaktavya dharma avoids falling extreme annihilation ucceda
one pudgalavada text affirms doctrine middle way thusif pudgala could described term existence non-existence one would fall nihilism ucchedadristi eternalism sasvatadrsti buddha doe allow u uphold two opinions

vasubandhu begin stating vtsputrya hold pudgala 'is based' five aggregate could mean one two things
case pudgala nominal designation five aggregate independent object
case pudgala also refers aggregate something else independent themvasubandhu argues 'pudgala' identical aggregate label them
vasubandhu first argues either perceive pudgala directly perceive perceiving aggregates
perceive directly aggregate would based pudgala way around
vasubandhu also attack view perceive pudgala six senses
true pudgala nothing five aggregate since sens perceive direct sense impression nothing more

text mention lack knowledge also includes lack knowledge indefinable avaktavya refers pudgala
another pudgalavada text sammatiyanikayasastra put forth various argument following propositions
text claim pudgala neither existent purely conceptual construct
peter harvey agrees criticism leveled pudgalavadins moggaliputta-tissa vasubandhu find support pali nikayas pudgala concept
however according bhiksu thin chuthe creation theory pudgala represents reaction depersonalization abhidharmika tradition
pudgalavadins hand tried preserve essence doctrine substancelessness anatmavada
theory pudgala ha misinterpreted polemical literature nevertheless offer much doctrinal interest buddhist thinkersfurthermore thin chu analysis doctrine addsthe pudgalavadins probably satisfied interpretation according man merely result combination psychphysical factors
man something different chariot latter assemblage part separate piece whereas former essentially totality psycho-physical part develop conception birthaccording dan lusthaus buddhist school ha vilified buddhist peer misunderstood modern scholars
lusthaus argues far promoting view self atmavada vtsputrya position seen surviving text pudgala prajapti nominal existent neither identical different skandhas furthermore vtsputrya argument pudgala necessary prajapti since theory karma theory posit individual make spiritual progress assist individual likewise incoherent without
karma mean action done one time ha subsequent consequence individual later time even later life
positive negative consequence action dont accrue self-same individual would make sense speak thing like progress progressing buddhist practice becomes incoherent
person one suffers one performs reaps consequence karma buddha buddhist buddhism
obviously acceptable consequence buddhistlusthaus note vtsputryas theory simply attempt explain buddhist tradition leave unsaid assumed mainly undergoes rebirth ha moral responsibility attains enlightenment
according lusthaus vtsputryas buddhist might leave word pudgala unsaid narrative presupposed doctrine require it
