In he returned to Poland in a program of repatriation of POWs after the Polish Soviet War
He earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree at University of Warsaw in for a dissertation titled On the Applications of the Theory of Probability to Agricultural Experiments He was examined by Wac aw Sierpi ski and Stefan Mazurkiewicz among others He spent a couple of years in London and Paris on a fellowship to study statistics with Karl Pearson and mile Borel After his return to Poland he established the Biometric Laboratory at the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology in Warsaw
He published many books dealing with experiments and statistics and devised the way which the FDA tests medicines today
Neyman proposed and studied randomized experiments in Furthermore his paper On the Two Different Aspects of the Representative Method The Method of Stratified Sampling and the Method of Purposive Selection given at the Royal Statistical Society on June was the groundbreaking event leading to modern scientific sampling He introduced the confidence interval in his paper in Another noted contribution is the Neyman Pearson lemma the basis of hypothesis testing
He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in in Bologna and a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in in Amsterdam
In he moved to Berkeley where he worked for the rest of his life Thirty nine students received their Ph Ds under his advisorship In he was awarded the Guy Medal of the Royal Statistical Society and three years later the U S National Medal of Science He died in Oakland California in
