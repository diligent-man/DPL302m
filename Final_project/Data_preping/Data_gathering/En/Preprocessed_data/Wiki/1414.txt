Weill's next major target in was another prominent investment bank Loeb Rhoades Hornblower Co which like Shearson had been suffering financial difficulties and was looking for a potential acquiror During Mothers Day Weekend in Shearson and Loeb agreed to an million million today all stock merger to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades with Weill assuming the position of CEO of the combined firm At the time of the merger Shearson Loeb Rhoades with million of combined assets and approximately million of revenue was among the largest investment banking houses By most measures Shearson became the second largest brokerage firm in the US trailing only Merrill Lynch The merger with Loeb Rhoades was more notable for introducing a stronger investment banking business to Shearson
