three of the tracks of love sux are vocal collaborations with other artists namely machine gun kelly blackbear and mark hoppus the largest amount of collaborations lavigne had ever included on an album
on working with hoppus lavigne said i don t think i had ever met mark before this but he blew me away and that h e was writing in front of me recording his vocals playing his bass
he can engineer and he s obviously an awesome songwriter and i got to see that firsthand
i have so much respect for him that i just keep gushing about him she further referred to kelly as one of the hardest workers she know s and that he came in the studio with his guitar and started playing his concept for the song and i was like this guy writes his stuff and he s really focused and serious
love sux was described by lavigne in an interview with entertainment weekly as the most alternative record i ve made from front to back further explaining most of my albums have like pop songs ballads and it s quite diverse
the people i worked with really understood me and come from that genre of music
she described the recording of the album as feeling as though she was back in high school hanging out with the type of people she grew up with and it was just effortless in an interview with nylon lavigne said that the album is light and happy even though there s songs about heartbreak and breaking up but that it s also anthemic and it s powerful and it has a positive message for people to stand up for yourself to have self worth she further stated that love sux is the album she had wanted to make for her whole career drawing skate punk influences from nofx blink green day and the offspring
love sux opens with the track cannonball described by ali shutler of nme as a furious electro dance opener which starts with a burst of buoyant guitars and the angsty scream of like a ticking time bomb i m about to explode and that less than seconds in the tune veers drastically into hyper pop territory
the second track bois lie features american musician machine gun kelly and was described by bobby olivier of spin as a speedy duet which builds to a he said she said climax and as a sonic sequel to mgk s forget me too
bite me is the album s third track and lead single and has drawn comparisons to lavigne s earlier studio albums let go and the best damn thing as well as to the band paramore
billboard described it as a guitar and drum heavy track which features lavigne raging at her former lover for failing to treat her properly promising that they ll always regret being kicked out of her life fourth track and second single love it when you hate me was described by shutner as a pop punk banger and emily carter writing for kerrang noted that the song hears the canadian star embracing nostalgic pop punk in the chorus the highs the lows the yes the nos you re so hot when you get cold don t call me baby i love it when you hate me and fresher elements in the verses the title track love sux follows as the album s fifth track and was described by tom williams of the line of best fit as featuring a fantastic guitar riff that recalls celebrity skin era hole
kiss me like the world is ending is the sixth track which was said by jessie atkinson of gigwise to contain a guitar riff reminiscent of blink s all the small things
seventh track avalanche was described by shutler as find ing lavigne now just as confused as she was on her breakout track complicated featuring the lyrics i wish my life came with instructions but that with a delicious synth driven breakdown she s far more self assured here th track all i wanted featuring mark hoppus sees the two punk veterans trade in various past memories for a surprisingly affecting number
th track dare to love me is a delicate ballad containing fraught emotion and was described by atkinson as a piano led beauty
break of a heartache is the album s th and final track and was said by shannon garner of clash to be a bombastic number that confidently brushes off past trauma and reassures people that you can overcome things and change how you feel towards certain situations given the time
lavigne made a concert at the roxy theater in new york city celebrating on love sux album release party with machine gun kelly and travis barker she performed the songs from the album bite me love it when you hate me and bois lie with machine gun kelly and her other hit songs
the album s lead single bite me was released on november

at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of to reviews from mainstream critics the album has an average score of based on reviews
it marks lavigne s highest rated album of her career to date
in a positive review from clash shannon garner wrote that it would be easy to disregard lavigne s album as part of the current s nostalgia storm that s on the rise but it s far from hazy nostalgia further remarking that love sux showcases growth in lavigne as an artist and that the album is more of an antidote to pop progress rather than a nostalgic throwback concluding that it just has all the elements of what made us fall in love with avril lavigne in the first place
tom williams of the line of best fit complimented love sux commenting that the album brings the energy up to a almost immediately and rarely turns it down across the album s minutes
roisin o connor of the independent wrote that the album is lavigne s best album since s the best damn thing which moved away from her earlier grunge based sound and into catchier territory
it says a lot about the year old s conviction that her rebel girl schtick doesn t feel hackneyed while critical of some of the album s lyrics o connor concluded that love sux is shameless but cathartic hit of nostalgia
writing for nme ali shutler reviewed love sux positively remarking that the album is an unapologetic blast of self empowerment and a progressive pop punk album that eschews the old rules but not at the expense of maximalist joyful guitar anthems
hannah jane parkinson of the guardian opined that the album contains high energy bangers one after the other and is exuberant enough to have you partying like it s
in a more mixed review jessie atkinson of gigwise commented now thirty seven years old avril is still playing with schoolbook colloquialisms and the dramas of one who is unlucky in love
the results are undeniably fun especially for those of us who were young at the time of s let go and the new youth who are dabbling in chequered wrist warmers and smudged liner
