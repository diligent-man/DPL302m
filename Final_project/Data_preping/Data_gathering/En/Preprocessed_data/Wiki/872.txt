in greek mythology the horae h ri or horai h ra or hours greek translit h rai pronounced h raj seasons were the goddesses of the seasons and the natural portions of time
the term horae comes from the proto indo european y h r year
horae were originally the personifications of nature in its different seasonal aspects but in later times they were regarded as goddesses of order in general and natural justice
they bring and bestow ripeness they come and go in accordance with the firm law of the periodicities of nature and of life karl kerenyi observed adding hora means the correct moment traditionally they guarded the gates of olympus promoted the fertility of the earth and rallied the stars and constellations
the course of the seasons was also symbolically described as the dance of the horae and they were accordingly given the attributes of spring flowers fragrance and graceful freshness for example in hesiod s works and days the fair haired horai together with the charites and peitho crown pandora she of all gifts with garlands of flowers
similarly aphrodite emerging from the sea and coming ashore at cyprus is dressed and adorned by the horai and according to a surviving fragment of the epic cypria aphrodite wore clothing made for her by the charites and horai dyed with spring flowers such as the horai themselves wear the number of horae varied according to different sources but was most commonly three either the trio of thallo auxo and carpo goddesses of the order of nature or eunomia goddess of good order and lawful conduct and her sisters dike goddess of justice and eirene goddess of peace
in argos two horae rather than three were recognised presumably winter and summer auxesia possibly another name for auxo and damia possibly another name for carpo
in late euhemerist interpretations they were seen as cretan maidens who were worshipped as goddesses after they had been wrongfully stoned to death
the earliest written mention of horai is in the iliad where they appear as keepers of zeus s cloud gates
hardly any traces of that function are found in the subsequent tradition karl galinsky remarked in passing
they were daughters of zeus and themis half sisters to the moirai
the horai are mentioned in two aspects in hesiod and the homeric hymns
in one variant emphasizing their fruitful aspect thallo auxo and carpo the goddesses of the three seasons the greeks recognized spring summer and autumn were worshipped primarily amongst rural farmers throughout greece
in the other variant emphasizing the right order aspect of the horai hesiod says that zeus wedded bright themis who bore dik eunomia and eirene who were law and order goddesses that maintained the stability of society they were worshipped primarily in the cities of athens argos and olympia of the first more familiar triad associated with aphrodite and zeus is their origins as emblems of times of life growth and the classical three seasons of year
thallo literally the one who brings blossoms or flora for romans or thalatte was the goddess of spring buds and blooms a protector of youth
increaser as in plant growth or auxesia was worshipped alongside hegemone in athens as one of their two charites auxo was the charis of spring and hegemone was the charis of autumn
one of the horae and the goddess and personification of the season of summer she is the protector of vegetation and plants and growth and fertility
carpo carpho or xarpo not to be mistaken with karpos was the one who brings food though robert graves in the greek myths translates this name as withering and was in charge of autumn ripening and harvesting as well as guarding the way to mount olympus and letting back the clouds surrounding the mountain if one of the gods left
she was an attendant to persephone aphrodite and hera and was also associated with dionysus apollo and pan
at athens two horae thallo the hora of spring and carpo the hora of autumn also appear in rites of attica noted by pausanias in the nd century ad
thallo auxo and carpo are often accompanied by chione a daughter of boreas the god personification of the north wind and orithyia oreithyia originally a mortal princess who was later deified as a goddess of cold mountain winds and the goddess personification of snow and winter
along with chione thallo auxo and carpo were a part of the entourage of the goddess of the turn of the seasons persephone of the second triad associated to themis and zeus for law and order
dik justice iustitia for romans was the goddess of moral justice she ruled over human justice as her mother themis ruled over divine justice
the anthropomorphisation of dik as an ever young woman dwelling in the cities of men was so ancient and strong that in the rd century bce aratus in phaenomena asserted that she was born a mortal and that though zeus placed her on earth to keep mankind just he quickly learned this was impossible and placed her next to him on olympus as the greek astronomical astrological constellation the maiden
eunomia order governance according to good laws was the goddess of law and legislation
the same or a different goddess may have been a daughter of hermes and aphrodite
eirene or irene
peace the roman equivalent was pax was the personification of peace and wealth and was depicted in art as a beautiful young woman carrying a cornucopia scepter and a torch or rhyton the last triad of horae was identified by hyginus
pherusa substance farm estates
euporie or euporia abundance and
orthosie or orthosia prosperity nonnus in his dionysiaca mentions a distinct set of four horae the daughters of helios
quintus smyrnaeus also attributes the horae as the daughters of helios and selene and describes them as the four handmaidens of hera
the seasons were personified by the ancients the greeks represented them generally as women but on some antique monuments they are depicted as winged children with attributes peculiar to each season
the greek words for the four seasons of year
nicolas poussin has represented the four seasons by subjects drawn from the bible spring is portrayed by adam and eve in paradise summer by ruth gleaning autumn by joshua and caleb bearing grapes from the promised land and winter by the deluge
in more modern representations the seasons are often surrounding apollo spring as flora crowned with flowers and in a shaded green drapery over a white robe summer standing under the lion in the zodiac with a gold coloured drapery over a white gauze vestment the edges of which are tinged by the yellow rays of the sun holding a sickle having near her a wheat sheaf autumn as a bacchante in a violet coloured garment pressing grapes with one band into a golden cup which she holds in the other and winter as an aged person placed in the shade at a great distance from the god
finally a quite separate suite of horae personified the twelve hours originally only ten as tutelary goddesses of the times of day
the hours run from just before sunrise to just after sunset thus winter hours are short summer hours are long
according to hyginus the list is only of nine borrowed from the three classical triads alternated
a distinct set of ten or twelve hours is much less known and they are described as daughters of chronos time
the last set of hours of the day and night is allegorically represented in the following
