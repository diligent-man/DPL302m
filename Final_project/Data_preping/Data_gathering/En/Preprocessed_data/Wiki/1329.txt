the apostolic vicariate of the midland district later of the central district was an ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the roman catholic church in england and wales
it was led by an apostolic vicar or vicar apostolic who was a titular bishop
the apostolic vicariate of the midland district was created in and changed its name to the central district in
it was dissolved in and was replaced by two dioceses
soon after the accession of anglican tudor queen elizabeth i the bishops of england were forced to choose between taking the oath of supremacy thus denying the authority of the pope and losing their episcopal sees
those who chose to continue their allegiance to rome were subsequently deposed and replaced in their sees by priests of the church of england
most of the deposed bishops were imprisoned in various locations and died in captivity over a period of years though some left the country and continued their work overseas
the last of the deposed bishops was thomas goldwell bishop of st asaph who died in rome on april
in pope urban viii decided once again to appoint a bishop with jurisdiction in england
so it was that dr william bishop was appointed with the title of apostolic vicar of england
he died shortly afterwards and was succeeded by dr richard smith who in august was forced to resign and fled to france
the office then remained vacant until its revival in with the appointment of dr john leyburn as apostolic vicar
in the first vicar apostolic dr bishop divided england into six areas and placed a superior at the head of each with the title of vicar general
this structure remained in place until dr leyburn reduced the number from six to four
it was on the basis of these four areas that on january pope innocent xi increased the number of bishops in england to four with the result that the territory of the former single apostolic vicariate of england and wales was reduced becoming the apostolic vicariate of the london district
so it was that the vicariate apostolic of the midland district was created along with those of the northern and the western including wales districts
the first apostolic vicar of the midland district appointed with effect from january was bishop bonaventure giffard who in was translated to become the vicar apostolic of the london district
the midland district consisted of the historic counties of cambridgeshire with the isle of ely derbyshire huntingdonshire leicestershire lincolnshire norfolk northamptonshire nottinghamshire oxfordshire rutland shropshire staffordshire suffolk warwickshire and worcestershire
notwithstanding intermittent persecution an apostolic vicariate of the midland district continued in existence until in when the existing four vicariates were further divided
the midland district was renamed the central district on july but it lost jurisdiction of the counties of cambridgeshire with the isle of ely huntingdonshire lincolnshire norfolk northamptonshire and rutland to the newly formed the apostolic vicariate of the eastern district
the central district was to last only ten years until on september pope pius ix issued the bull universalis ecclesiae by which thirteen new dioceses were created commonly known as the restoration of the english hierarchy among them the diocese of birmingham which replaced formally the previous vicariate
the last apostolic vicar of the midland district was bishop thomas walsh who from till had the new title vicar apostolic of the central district
bishop walsh was succeeded as vicar apostolic of the central district by the benedictine william bernard ullathorne who on september received the new title of bishop of birmingham
on october a new ecclesiastical province was created dependent on birmingham and the title became that of the metropolitan archbishop of birmingham
