united states senator joseph s
clark and senator robert f
kennedy toured the mississippi delta on april
at the behest of civil rights lawyer marian wright clark and kennedy together with two other senators traveled to mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation
following a field hearing they drove from greenville to clarksdale stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went
deeply disturbed by what they saw the senators returned to washington d c
and began pushing for a series of reforms to alleviate the situation
extensive media coverage of the event exposed the american public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation
the country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions
efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the s
in the majority of legislative program supporting the united states government s war on poverty was due to expire
in an attempt to generate national interest in renewing funding for the effort the united states senate committee on labor s subcommittee on poverty held a series of hearings related to hunger starting march
one of first the testifying witnesses was marian wright a year old yale law school graduate working with the naacp s legal defense fund in mississippi
she told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the mississippi delta
in addition to this two parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits and most counties in mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps
with little to no income most households could not produce the necessary funds
as a result wright argued mississippians were starving
they re starving and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north
i wish that the senators would have a chance to go and just look at the empty cupboards in the delta and the number of people who are going around and begging just to feed their children
chairman joseph s
clark suggested that the subcommittee travel to mississippi to verify wright s testimony
of the subcommittee s nine members senators robert f
kennedy jacob javits george murphy agreed to the idea and accompanied him
kennedy dispatched his aide peter edelman to get an advanced view on the situation
edelman spoke extensively with wright whom he would marry months later
the subcommittee members flew into jackson on april
that evening the senators dined with prominent mississippians including oscar carr and charles evers
carr later described kennedy as a very shy man who continuously asked questions evers said we talked and talked and he listened local civil rights activist amzie moore acted as kennedy s host
a field hearing was scheduled for april
mississippi senator john stennis a staunch segregationist was scheduled to be interviewed
he disapproved of the federal efforts to improve the economic situation of black people and sought to discredit them by attacking the head start program s parent agency the child development group of mississippi cdgm
the head start project provided services to impoverished children and was funded with grants from the federal government thereby preventing state authorities from interfering with its activities
by potentially improving the socioeconomic status of black mississippians head start threatened the white political power base that dominated the state
just days after money for the program had been appropriated stennis and state officials began scrutinizing it and requesting financial records
in the days before stennis scheduled testimony jackson s two newspapers both supportive of segregation ran several stories about the senator s planned critique
upon the poverty subcommittee s arrival in the city clark announced that he considered questions concerning head start and funding irregularities to already be answered and that the hearing would not spend significant time discussing the issue
stennis responded by leaking his draft testimony to the press
the subcommittee hearing took place in the olympic ballroom of the heidelberg hotel in jackson
it was originally supposed to take place in a room meant to accommodate persons but the subcommittee relocated after local media attention stirred enough interest to bring the crowd to about people
in his opening remarks clark stated that the hearing intended to be neither a witch hunt or a whitewash
we are here to find out the basic facts stennis was called as the first witness
he admitted that there was poverty in his state but posited that federal anti poverty programs were overrunning expected costs and that he wished to support taxpayers
he then declared that the federal government had bypassed responsible honest capable local leadership and in favor of northerners and as a result its offices had become a stake hold of beatniks and immorality
he requested that the governor be empowered to suspend any project he determines not in the public interest and finished by highlighting the fact that dollars worth of cdgm s funds were proclaimed by a government audit to be unaccounted for
clark then allowed members of the subcommittee to question stennis
kennedy presented a private report conducted by a new york based firm at the behest of the college that hosted cdgm
according to the new audit the amount of wasted funds was deemed to be relatively minor and no evidence was found to substantiate the government s allegation
stennis was flustered and declared that the senate committee on appropriations of which he was a member should have been informed of the conflicting calculations
he concluded it s another illustration of the mysterious way in which this independent agency operates thanked the committee for their time and left the hotel
testimony was then given about conditions in the delta from both public officials and local impoverished inhabitants
a black doctor stated that the state suffered from a high infant mortality rate and that the rate was twice as high for black babies
he added that the mortality rate of black babies from early childhood illnesses was five times greater than that for white infants
head start workers testified that older children they had examined displayed symptoms of anemia and other nutritional deficiencies
it was also stated that the decline in demand for agriculture labor increased unemployment and that many of the adults were unskilled did not have access to adequate transportation or training programs or faced racial discrimination in their work
robert ezelle former chairman of the jackson chamber of commerce asserted that the greatest problem afflicting mississippi was its dysfunctional education system
he stated that adults out of the total million had not received schooling beyond the fourth grade and that a further had never had any education
civil rights activist unita blackwell defended the head start program saying it was the only anti poverty initiative that addressed the locals problems
when questioned by kennedy about hunger she stated that there was a problem with hunger in her county and that the shift from surplus food aid to the stamp program had worsened the situation
wright spoke once more asserting after two civil rights bills and the third year of the poverty bill the negro in mississippi is poorer than he was he has less housing he is badly educated he is almost in despair kennedy took his greatest interest in the locals statements
afterwards he told evers i want to see it
the following day kennedy and clark drove into the delta area while the other senators flew back to washington d c
they were accompanied by evers wright moore edelman carr a dozen or so reporters from state and national newspapers and the big three television networks and an assortment of u s
marshals state highway patrolmen and local police
that morning the senators reviewed anti poverty programs underway in greenville and a nearby tent city that had been established by striking farm workers
after lunch kennedy s and clark s motorcade traveled at speeds over mph down u s
route to visit locations specifically selected by wright and moore
their first stop was a dilapidated shotgun house in cleveland in which people resided
holes were present in the flooring and roofing and the only food in the refrigerator was a jar of peanut butter
one boy told kennedy that all he had for breakfast and dinner was molasses and that he didn t eat any lunch
walking to the next house kennedy whispered to edelman i ve been to third world countries and i ve never seen anything like this
the following home belonged to a mother of seven
there were no tables or cutlery in the house and the toilet operated without plumbing
roaches and rats ran across the floor
kennedy s attention was drawn to a month old boy who was playing with rice grains on the floor
the child was covered in sores and bloated from hunger
kennedy knelt down and stroked his cheek
he said my god i didn t know this kind of thing existed
how can a country like this allow it maybe they just don t know clark labeled what lay before them a national disgrace kennedy caressed the child and talked to him but elicited no response
the senator began to cry
kennedy stepped outside and quietly remarked we spend billion a year on armaments and billion a year on dogs
we have to do more for these children that didn t ask to be born into this local newspaper editor cliff langford who strongly disliked kennedy shouted back that the two senators were being brainwashed
clark retorted don t worry
we ve been brainwashed from the other side langford added i don t know of anybody starving down here kennedy responded step over here and i ll introduce you to some clark reassured the reporters that he and kennedy were not observing conditions in the delta to find fault but rather just to see if we can do anything about it
the senators motorcade continued on towards clarksdale but kennedy asked that they stop in the small town of mound bayou
with no advanced notice kennedy his aides and half a dozen reporters walked into the home of a year old man named andrew jackson his wife and their six kids
there was no electricity running water or toilet
there were two pictures in the house one of the glorybound singers a clarksdale based gospel group and another of john f
kennedy
jackson was incredulous that he was meeting the brother of the late president and asked is you really mr
bobby kennedy kennedy smiled and shook his hand replying yes
and are you really mr
andrew jackson
a thousand people mostly black school children awaited the senators outside the clarksdale neighborhood center
the two stayed in the city for only minutes clark climbed on top of a car to announce that their planned press conference was canceled as their flight in memphis was due to take off in two hours for the capital and he was going to catch that plane meanwhile kennedy had mounted another vehicle and gave a short speech to the crowd
he said he was glad to have made the trip and told them the problems of poverty are problems of all united states citizens he was shortly thereafter engulfed by people wanting handshakes and autographs though police soon cleared the way and the motorcade continued onto the highway
kennedy returned to washington d c
on the evening of april
he walked in on his family having dinner at hickory hill highly agitated and in the words of his daughter kathleen ashen faced he announced to his children in mississippi a whole family lives in a shack the size of this room
the children are covered with sores and their tummies stick out because they have no food
do you know how lucky you are do you know how lucky you are do something for your country
the following morning kennedy and edelman met with secretary of agriculture orville freeman and angrily criticized the food stamp program for charging families that had no income
though freeman was keen on avoiding a political dispute with kennedy he feared that by concurring with the senator he would anger the southern bloc in congress that held great influence over his department s budget
he deflected bob there isn t anyone in america who has no income kennedy replied i ll tell you what
i ll send peter edelman here back down there with some of your people
will you agree that you ll change the regulations if your people are convinced there really are people in mississippi who have no income freeman agreed and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps
returning to new york on april kennedy exclaimed to the wife of one of his aides you don t know what i saw i have done nothing in my life everything i have done was a waste everything i have done was worthless when asked about the poverty subcommittee s findings clark said that more resources needed to be allocated to the war on poverty
he also said that the united states needed a reawakening of a conscience the entire subcommittee sent a letter to president lyndon b
johnson about their discoveries and the findings of the department of agriculture officials who had been dispatched to the delta writing about conditions of malnutrition and widespread hunger that can only be described as shocking and imploring federal government to declare an emergency
johnson never responded
several johnson administration officials in addition to freeman were skeptical of the reports of starvation in the delta
johnson had seen the news coverage of the event and on april he ordered that his top domestic aide joseph califano give him a quick report califano replied minutes later writing that freeman was hesitant to make major changes to the administration s food stamp program until the original system was sanctioned by congress
when his aides unanimously approved of an extensive relief plan johnson already uneasy about the food stamp program rejected the proposal
kennedy made a direct appeal to johnson involving increased subsidization of food stamps and the supplement of emergency food rations for of the most impoverished mississippians
johnson ignored it a decision an editorial in the nation claimed was due to the fact that he was incapable of rising above personal politics once news of the situation in the delta went public mississippi governor paul b
johnson jr
dismissed the report as the product of socialist minded senators he also told journalist bill minor all the negroes i ve seen around here are so fat they shine following the publication in june of a particularly severe report compiled by the field foundation of new york governor johnson quietly commissioned a statewide study about children s nutrition
its findings concurred with those of the field foundation
on july and july clark held another set of congressional hearings on hunger in the delta to pressure freeman attracting widespread media coverage
the hearings were tense with clark kennedy javits and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with mississippi senators stennis and james eastland also a staunch segregationist and mississippi board of health officer a
kennedy called child psychologist robert coles to testify on poverty s effect on children in the mississippi delta
one north carolina doctor described an unwritten policy on the part of those who control the state to eliminate the negro mississippian either by driving him out of the state or starving him to death when stennis and eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves to which none accepted
on the second day of proceedings secretary freeman and senator javits got into a shouting match with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities opinions declare an emergency and immediately supply food to the region
he remarked we seem to be able to send airplanes to the congo in a terrible hurry
we first heard of the desperation point of poor mississippi negroes months ago and we are still hearing that there is starvation in mississippi kennedy openly expressed his frustration with johnson administration officials perceived inability to understand the extent of the delta s problems and other bureaucratic complications saying it seems to me we are floundering around a great deal
in the end kennedy managed to amend the renewal of the economic opportunity act of to include provisions for a national survey on nutrition
stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a million emergency fund be established for food and medical services
despite resistance from other southern legislators and a lack of support from president johnson stennis bill passed
the senate also voted unanimously to create a select committee on nutrition and human needs
kennedy subsequently embarked on more poverty tours to investigate and publicize impoverished conditions across the united states
he frequently invoked the delta tour in legislative discussions and during his presidential campaign
the media coverage from the event brought national attention to the food insecurity issues in the delta
most americans were shocked by the conditions described in the area
almost immediately the field foundation of new york dispatched a team of doctors to mississippi to examine children and verify the senators findings
they labeled the conditions they observed a national disaster documenting cases of kwashiorkor rickets and other signs of malnutrition and starvation
one doctor likened state of affairs to the worst he had seen in eastern kenya
this countered initial public reactions of disbelief at the severity of the situation
the citizens crusade against poverty an advocacy group already studying the problems in the delta quickly created a citizens board of inquiry into hunger and malnutrition in the united states in april the board published a report of its findings entitled hunger u s a
this was shortly followed by a critique of the national school lunch program by a coalition of women s organizations
in conversation with wright and edelemen kennedy remarked the only way there s going to be change is if it s more uncomfortable for congress not to act than it is for them to act you ve got to get a whole lot of poor people who just come to washington and stay here until congress gets really embarrassed and they have to act the following week wright proposed the idea to martin luther king jr who subsequently organized the poor people s march on washington
around the same time cbs broadcast a major documentary hunger in america which had been made on the suggestion of kennedy to television executive don hewitt
the trip to the mississippi delta made hunger a public issue of interest in the united states
following the revelations of food insecurity a powerful anti hunger movement emerged in the country and worked to reform food assistance programs while proposing new ones
federal expenditures on food assistance grew by percent over the next decade
marian wright would later say that the episode set in motion a chain of events that culminated in years later in the virtual elimination of hunger in america during the nixon years
the mississippi delta tour was featured in the s american civil rights documentary series eyes on the prize
in may democratic senator paul wellstone inspired by the original trip visited the delta to bring attention to race and gender and poverty and children in america from july until july wright led local activists and politicians on a bus tour of the region to observe the th anniversary of the event
it was followed by a panel discussion on poverty hunger and healthcare in the mississippi
great society
