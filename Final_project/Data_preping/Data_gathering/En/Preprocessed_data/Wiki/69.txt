a heerlijkheid a dutch word pl
heerlijkheden also called heerschap latin dominium was a landed estate that served as the lowest administrative and judicial unit in rural areas in the dutch speaking low countries before
it originated as a unit of lordship under the feudal system during the middle ages
the english equivalents are manor seigniory and lordship
the german equivalent is herrschaft
the heerlijkheid system was the dutch version of manorialism that prevailed in the low countries and was the precursor to the modern municipality system in the netherlands and flemish belgium
a typical heerlijkheid manor consisted of a village and the surrounding lands extending out for a kilometre or so
taking th century wassenaar as an example of a large hoge heerlijkheid it was morgens in size and had houses
nearby voorschoten was morgens in size and had houses
nootdorp was an ambachtsheerlijkheid of morgens and houses
there were heerlijkheden in the province of holland in the th century
all fell into the last three categories in the list below except for a few for which this information is unknown
not all heerlijkheden were the same
they differed in size and composition
also a heerlijkheid should not be confused with a larger territory like a county graafschap or viscounty burggraafschap nor with administrative regions on par with an english shire dutch gouw german gau or roman or carolingian pagus
a flemish castellany kasselrij or burggraafschap was larger and different from a heerlijkheid but they were similar in some ways
there were different kinds of heerlijkheid
vrijheerlijkheid an allod or allodium
these heerlijkheden were found usually at the edges of a county and were called free vrij because they were allodial instead of a fief held by an overlord
erfheerlijkheid a feudal barony
hoge heerlijkheid a great barony or honour either a fief or allodium
in these large lordships the lord had jurisdiction to appoint a bailiff baljuw instead of just a reeve schout and to administer capital punishment
it was possible for a heerlijkheid to be both prescriptive vrij and large hoge
the largest were actually mini counties within the county
ambacht or ambachtsheerlijkheid a serjeanty often located inland rather than on the borders
serjeanties sometimes consisted of nothing more than a castle and a few hectares of land although most were larger than this
the serjeant did not have the power of pit and gallows i e the power to impose the death penalty
schoutsambt a reeveland the territory under the charge of a reeve schout thus equivalent to the jurisdiction of a heerlijkheid
the central figure was the lord of the heerlijkheid and effectively its owner the manorial lord or lady
in dutch the lord was called heer and the lady vrouw e
the lord was also referred to by the latin word dominus
a rarer english alternative is seigneur
there were different kinds of lord and lady
vrijheer and vrijvrouwe literally free lord and free lady allodial lord or allodiary tenant of an allodial lordship
erfheer and erfvrouwe literally hereditary lord and hereditary lady feudal baron or mesne lord tenant of a fiefdom
baanderheer literally knight banneret tenant by knight service some lords used this title when their noble line was ancient and therefore superior to other nobles
ambachtsheer tenant by serjeanty ambacht or ambachtsheerlijkheid under the feudal system a manorial lord typically was himself the vassal of a higher ranking tenant in chief usually a highborn noble who was in turn the crown vassal of the king or emperor
however sometimes there was no mesne tenancy tussenliggende heerschappij as was the case with knight s fees held in capite rijksonmiddellijke heerlijkheid
the heerlijkheid was ruled directly by a count graaf a viscount burggraaf or a baron baron
also it was not uncommon for the lord to be ecclesiastical e g
a prince bishop prins bisschop or prince abbot vorst abt
originally heerlijkheden were held exclusively by the nobility
however starting around the th century lordship over a heerlijkheid was not synonymous with nobility
a heerlijkheid could be bought and sold
many ended up in the hands of wealthy merchants and a political class known as the regents
in addition many were bought by boroughs burghs
in the th th and th centuries it was not unusual for a borough to purchase the heerlijkheden around it in order to gain control and ownership of the surrounding land and the resulting economic advantages
boroughs were themselves not part of the manorial system the countryside and villages were governed by lords whereas boroughs were self governing
the heerlijkheden came into being as a result of the feudal system in particular the sovereign s delegated judicial prerogative
the crown as lord paramount granted the right to govern and to exercise judicial authority to a crown vassal often a confidante or as a reward for military service or political support
the crown vassal e g
a count graaf or duke hertog thus exercised all or part of the sovereign s royal authority
in turn the crown vassal granted rights to the mesne lords of the heerlijkheden
because a fief leen originated out of a bond between vassal and lord for military service vassalage dutch manschap was personal not heritable
with the advent of professional armies the vassalage bond fell into disuse or was replaced by scutage however vassalage remained personal
one of the consequences of this was that on the death of the vassal leenman or vazal the fief escheated to the lord leenheer
the vassal s heir was able to retain the heerlijkheid through the commendation ceremony leenhulde the process of paying homage and swearing fealty officiated at the head manor court souveraine leenhof or leenkammer
the new vassal made a symbolic payment leenverhef to his lord
the same ceremony was held when a heerlijkheid manor was sold
if there was no direct descendant other blood relatives could exercise their right of laudatio parentum du naderschap which grants them a right of first refusal and explains how heerlijkheden were able to be kept in the same families for centuries
the tenancy of a heerlijkheid is not to be confused with land ownership
it was an estate in land not land per se
although lords of the manor generally owned property within a heerlijkheid often substantial amounts it was possible for a lord not to own any property at all within his own heerlijkheid
also when agricultural land was held by a lord in the low countries the amount held was smaller in comparison to other countries
lordship conferred a set of manorial rights
the word heerlijkheid denotes an estate in which these limited rights were held and could be exercised
the rights exercised varied widely and were more extensive and survived longer in the eastern provinces
a manorial lord was able to function as a minor potentate within his heerlijkheid
however his manorial rights were limited and subject to numerous restrictions
the lord was required to conduct himself in accordance with local customary law
appointments one of the most important manorial rights was the right to appoint bailiffs reeves aldermen magistrates schoolmasters dike and polder officials and so on
a fee was paid by the recipients of these appointments
in particular the lord was entitled to make the important appointment of the schout reeve
the reeve was charged with local administrative law enforcement and prosecutorial duties
the lord s right to appoint this official was significant because it entailed the associated right to receive the profits from amercements collected by the reeve from sentences and fines for minor and mid level offences
higher fines were paid to officials appointed by a count or duke i e
the sheriff called variously hoofdschout hoofdmeier drossaard or amman
the lord of the manor was entitled to act as reeve himself but most lords delegated this duty by appointing someone else to the office
advowson a lord might have a right to make advowsons be they collative collatie presentative gezag or donative agrement when it comes to instituting a parish priest or minister
as early as the high middle ages there were already disputes with ecclesiastical authorities over the usurpation of this right
after the reformation the involvement of a lord in a minister s institution might similarly result in tension between the lord and his vassals particularly in places where the lord was of a different faith than most of his fellow parishioners
manor house most heerlijkheden had a manor house that served as the caput or capital messuage of the lord though not necessarily his permanent residence if he held multiple manors
there were sometimes grand homes with estates or even castles
some of these grand homes and castles still exist
church if a parochial church had been founded by a previous lord the lord was considered to have his own church and enjoy the rights that went with that
coat of arms a lord had his own coat of arms which was displayed in places like church pews and windows and carriages
many of these became municipal coats of arms a lord was entitled to receive feudal incidents in the form of rents levies and other payments from various financial and property rights associated with a heerlijkheid
real burdens onroerende belastingen any bonded or unfree feuar cijnsplichtige of the manor s dependent holdings was required to pay a yearly feu duty cijns or cijnsgeld which is comparable to the payment of property taxes today
the amount of the cijns was proportional to the size of the burdened land
since the amount of the cijns was not tied to inflation it remained negligible during most of this period
tenurial rents pachtgelden the largest revenue source for the lord of the manor was usually the leasehold rents from tenant farmers working free peasant land
entry fine pontpenning or werfschilling the lord of the manor was entitled to levy a fee of around of the sales price when holdings or tenancies were conveyed
relief keurmede usually the lord was entitled to levy a relief duty or heriot which was sometimes referred to in dutch as the recht van de dode hand or dead hand right
this was an inheritance tax on a deceased tenant s estate that granted the privilege to an heir to succeed to the deceased s estate
the amount was usually in the order of of the value of the real property
sometimes the lord also had the right to take the deceased s best chattel beste kateil katell
depending on the region this was also referred to as the best beast beste hoofd referring to the best animal in the herd or the high chair hoogstoel meaning the nicest piece of household furniture
often there was also a special relief for the estate of a foreigner inwijkeling that is someone not born in the heerlijkheid and illegitimate children
tolls tolgelden tolls were charged to cross the borders of most heerlijkheden
this was a kind of road toll wegentol but it also took the form of a charge on the transport of specific commodities e g
salt or people
astrictions banrechten tenants were required to make use of the infrastructure mill smith oven etc that was operated by the lord of the manor more or less as a business
a typical example of these astrictions was thirlage banmolen grain could only be ground at the lord s water mill or windmill
a toll known as multure for grinding corn at the manorial mill was paid to the lord or to the miller who leased the mill from the lord
royal privileges vorstelijke rechten royal privileges included game rights hunting rights wind rights windrecht piscary visrecht and market rights marktrecht
these traditional rights were usually granted in fief to a vassal lord who continued to maintain them
ecclesiastical privileges kerkelijke rechten in some heerlijkheden certain privileges that were in principle held by the church were absorbed by the heerlijkheid
tithes might accrue to the feudal estate
fines described in the previous part in the section on the appointment of the schout
quitrent dienstgeld released a tenant from services due by custom to his lord
appointment fee referred to by schama as the leenrecht the perquisite paid on appointment to office
marriage and death duties marriage required the payment of a fee the consent of the lord merchet etc
in some places in later years the lord would receive gifts on st
walpurga s day instead
on death a tax also had to be paid originally heerlijkheden were in the hands of the nobility
much of the wealth of a noble family came from their ownership
many members of the nobility were heavily dependent on this source of power income and status
because the surnames of noble families were often derived from a heerlijkheid e g
van wassenaer it was important for the prestige of the family to maintain ownership over it
however the economic benefits of a heerlijkheid were not always certain finances were not always well arranged and some nobles were poor
in the province of holland possession of a heerlijkheid was a prerequisite for admission to the ridderschap literally the knighthood the college of nobles that represented rural areas in the states of holland
a seat in the ridderschap provided access to various financially interesting honorary positions and offices
it was not unusual for a noble to amass a number of heerlijkheden
queen beatrix is a modern day example of a noblewoman who holds the titles to many heerlijkheden
in addition to her primary titles she is the erfvrouwe and vrijvrouwe of ameland and the vrouwe of baarn besan on borculo bredevoort b tgenbach daasburg geertruidenberg heiloo upper and lower zwaluwe klundert lichtenvoorde loo montfort naaldwijk niervaart polanen steenbergen sint maartensdijk sint vith soest ter eem turnhout willemstad and zevenbergen
starting around nobles began selling the rights to heerlijkheden to non nobles however losing a heerlijkheid did not result in loss of noble status
the nobility were recognised by all as having a special status not attached to wealth or ownership of a heerlijkheid
in the southern provinces modern day belgium the financial character of a heerlijkheid was accentuated by the royal edict of may
from then on a noble title was granted only if the following minimum payment was obtained from the income of the feudal estate
for a barony baronie guilders
for a county graafschap or marquisate markizaat guilders
for a duchy hertogdom or principality prinsdom guilders in the southern provinces this edict ensured the financial stability of the most prominent heerlijkheden and resulted in the rise of a new nobility based on wealth
starting around the th century lordship over a heerlijkheid was not synonymous with nobility
a heerlijkheid could be bought and sold
many ended up in the hands of wealthy merchants and a small and exclusive political class known as the regents
in all the provinces the military obligations associated with a fief gradually died out so that by the th and th centuries the heerlijkheid was increasingly seen by non nobles as a status symbol
successful merchants and regents from the large towns saw the heerlijkheid as a country residence and a means of giving the appearance of noble status
it often came with large tracts of land and a castle or manor house
in noble fashion they then added the name of their heerlijkheid to their own surname resulting in surnames like deutz van assendelft six van oterleek pompe van meerdervoort and beelaerts van blokland
the word van in the surname meant of
however very few dutch surnames with van have their origins in the ownership of a heerlijkheid they became what j l
price refers to as a quasi nobility
a heerlijkheid was also a source of income and an investment but they were usually acquired for other reasons
in the netherlands acquiring the rights to heerlijkheden did not confer noble status
the regent families who purchased heerlijkheden were not a true nobility but by the early th century the ranks of the nobility had become so depleted that the dutch king elevated certain members of the former regent class to noble status
in the southern provinces modern day belgium heerlijkheden and the associated rights were abolished after the french invasion of
in the northern provinces modern day netherlands they were declared abolished around the same time as part of the inauguration of the batavian republic
this was formalised in the batavian constitution bataafsche staatsregeling
a distinction was made between the feudal rights of appointment and patronage which were completely abolished and the income related rights which were more complicated
some of these were feudal in nature and abolished
others were similar to contractual or property rights and therefore their loss was compensable
lordly claims for reparations flooded in
some heerlijkheid rights were maintained or later restored as property rights and still exist today
the overwhelming majority of the remaining rights disappeared in belgium on the introduction of the constitution and in the netherlands with the constitutional amendments
most of the administrative functions of a heerlijkheid were transferred to the municipality and fell under the new municipality act gemeentewet
responsibility for the manor courts and judicial system were taken over by the national government
after this the use of the title lord of is based on the ownership of the remaining non abolished rights
to this day there are people in the netherlands who use the title lord of
unlike in the u k there is no trade today in lord of the manor titles
what remains of the heerlijkheid system are many of the manors and castles
most of them are now parts of estates museums parks hotels etc
since the last heerlijkheid was seen over years ago many of the manor houses and castles have been rebuilt or have been fully or partially demolished
a sign erected at the remaining parts of the slot heemstede now in a park describes what happened to this particular manor
the history and fate of this manor are typical
