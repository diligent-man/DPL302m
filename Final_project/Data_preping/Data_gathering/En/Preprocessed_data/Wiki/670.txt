john henry poynting frs september march was an english physicist
he was the first professor of physics at mason science college from to and then the successor institution the university of birmingham until his death
poynting was the youngest son of thomas elford poynting a unitarian minister
he was born at the parsonage of the monton unitarian chapel in eccles lancashire his father serving as minister there from to in his boyhood he was educated at the nearby school operated by his father
from to he attended owens college now the university of manchester where his physics teachers included osborne reynolds and balfour stewart
from to he was a student at cambridge university where he attained high honours in mathematics after taking grinds with edward routh
in the late s he worked in the cavendish laboratory at cambridge under james clerk maxwell
in he became the first professor of physics at the university of birmingham
he was the developer and eponym of the poynting vector which describes the direction and magnitude of electromagnetic energy flow and is used in the poynting theorem a statement about energy conservation for electric and magnetic fields
this work was first published in
he performed a measurement of newton s gravitational constant by innovative means during
in he was the first to realise that the sun s radiation can draw in small particles towards it this was later named the poynting robertson effect
he discovered the torsion extension coupling in finite strain elasticity
this is now known as the positive poynting effect in torsion
poynting and the nobel prizewinner j
thomson co authored a multi volume undergraduate physics textbook which was in print for about years and was in widespread use during the first third of the th century
poynting wrote most of it
he was awarded an honorary msc in pure science in by birmingham university
poynting lived at st augustine s road edgbaston with his family and servants for some years
he previously lived at beaufort road edgbaston demolished and died of a diabetic coma aged at ampton road edgbaston in
in he married maria adney cropper
he was survived by his widow a son and two daughters
alfred j
lotka was among poynting s most famous students being inspired by poynting to apply the ideas of physical chemistry to biology
lotka dedicated his classic book on mathematical population biology to poynting
poynting predicted the poynting robertson effect whereby a particle of dust orbiting a star experiences a drag force which makes it spiral slowly into the star
howard p
robertson later restated the prediction using general relativity
poynting s name also pertains to the popular student society at the university of birmingham poynting physical society or pps
craters on mars and the moon are named in his honour as is the main physics building at the university of birmingham and the departmental society there the poynting physical society
he is credited with coining the expression greenhouse effect in to explain how infrared absorbing trace gasses such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the surface temperature of earth and mars
