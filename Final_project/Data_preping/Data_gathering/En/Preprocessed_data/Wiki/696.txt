the people yearbook has had the year say written in bold accompanying the word yearbook on the front cover since the people yearbook although this gradually changed in the more recent editions
since the year appeared in a more inconspicuous way on the front cover until the issue and the bold style of writing the year made a comeback in the issue
the year also appears on the spine
the people magazine yearbook was first published in the year by the time inc
magazine company and it was called private lives
this issue did not mention any year conspicuously on the front page or the inner page but the front flap of the hardcover version of the magazine described private lives as people s chronicle of an extraordinary year clearly describing that the events covered inside were from
next year the sequel to private lives was published and it was called private lives volume ii
the first page had an additional tagline that described the magazine as the year in review private lives
in there was another change in the publication and also its cover title
the year was added on the cover for the first time and this annual issue was called private lives
the year appeared in bold on the front cover
the first page described the publication as private lives the year in review
next year in people books released private lives with the first page that said private lives year in review
the year ushered in the single biggest change in the magazine title
the title was reworked and found a new moniker it was called people yearbook
previous title of private lives was dropped completely and the publication was defined as a yearbook for the first time

for example people magazine yearbook covered events of
and people magazine yearbook covered the events of the year
was the last year for this to happen
the yearbook covered events of
in a shift happened in the magazine that changed for the first time the year it actually covered within its pages
instead of covering the events of this issue covered the events of and arrived on the stands towards the end of
to make the shift properly understood the first page of this yearbook included a tagline the most memorable moments of
with this move people magazine yearbook changed its own year old tradition

since then the people magazine yearbook has been covering events of the same year that are on the front page
another typeface change was experimented for two years when people magazine yearbook and people magazine yearbook had an exclamation mark following the year
this was dropped in the yearbook and the publication discarded the exclamation mark
however this issue dropped the bold writing of the year on the front cover and replaced it with a more inconspicuous style and it was like that until the issue
the yearbook was a special flip cover issue wherein it combined a special edition memorabilia to cherish the memories of people that died in
the list included prince david bowie nancy reagan alan rickman doris roberts muhammad ali etc
the special edition could be accessed by flipping over the magazine

however in the yearbook the copyright was described as belonging to meredith corporation without any prominent tagline
the prominent bold writing of the year on the front cover made a comeback with the yearbook along with a tagline saying our extraordinary year together
