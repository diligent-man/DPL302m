ethylestrenol also known as ethyloestrenol or ethylnandrol and sold under the brand names maxibolin and orabolin among others is an androgen and anabolic steroid aas medication which has been used in the past for a variety of indications such as to promote weight gain and to treat anemia and osteoporosis but has been discontinued for use in humans
it is still available for veterinary use in australia and new zealand however
it is taken by mouth
side effects of ethylestrenol include symptoms of masculinization like acne increased hair growth voice changes and increased sexual desire
it can also cause liver damage
the drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor ar the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone dht
it has strong anabolic effects relative to its androgenic effects
the drug also has strong progestogenic effects
ethylestrenol is a prodrug of norethandrolone
ethylestrenol was first described in and was introduced for medical use in
in addition to its medical use ethylestrenol has been used to improve physique and performance
however it is described as a very weak muscle builder compared to other aas and in relation to this has not been commonly used for such purposes
the drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non medical use is generally illicit
ethylestrenol has been used for a variety of indications including
to promote weight gain and muscle growth
as an adjunct in the treatment of bone pain and decreased bone strength associated with osteoporosis
as an adjunct for catabolic states such as corticosteroid therapy and convalescence as in chronic infections extensive surgery and severe trauma
to treat treatment refractory anemias via stimulation of erythropoiesis such as acquired and congenital aplastic anemia and anemia of chronic kidney disease
as an adjunct to improve strength and well being in arthritis
to treat short stature in youthethylestrenol should not be taken by pregnant women as it can masculinize female fetuses
it is contraindicated in men with prostate cancer as it may accelerate the progression of the disease
side effects of ethylestrenol include virilization among others
as an aas ethylestrenol is an agonist of the androgen receptor ar similarly to androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone dht
it has low estrogenic activity via aromatization into ethylestradiol following transformation into norethandrolone strong progestogenic activity and a high ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity similarly to other nandrolone derivatives
like other alkylated aas ethylestrenol has a risk of hepatotoxicity
ethylestrenol has very low affinity for human serum sex hormone binding globulin shbg less than of that of testosterone and less than of that of dht
it is known to be metabolized into the closely related aas norethandrolone ethyl nortestosterone in the body and has been regarded as a prodrug of norethandrolone
this is in accordance with its very low affinity for the androgen receptor only about of that of testosterone and of that of dihydrotestosterone
ethylestrenol also known as deketo ethyl nortestosterone or as ethylestr en ol is a synthetic estrane steroid and a alkylated derivative of nandrolone nortestosterone nt
it is specifically the ethyl and deketo derivative of nandrolone as well as the deketo derivative of norethandrolone ethyl nt
other related aas include bolenol deketo ethyl nor androstenediol ethyldienolone ethyl nt norboletone ethyl methyl nt propetandrol ethyl nt propionate and tetrahydrogestrinone thg ethyl methyl nt
the progestins allylestrenol deketo allyl nt and lynestrenol deketo ethynyl nt are also closely related to ethylestrenol differing only by the c substitution
ethylestrenol was described in the literature in and approved for medical use in and in the united states in
ethylestrenol is the generic name of the drug and its inn usan and ban while thylestr nol is its dcf and ethylnandrol is its jan
the ban was formerly ethyloestrenol but it was eventually changed
ethylestrenol is or has been marketed under a variety of brand names including durabolin o duraboral fertabolin maxibolin maxibolin elixir orabolin orgabolin orgaboral and virastine
the brand name durabolin o is a contraction of durabolin oral durabolin being a brand name of the nandrolone ester nandrolone phenylpropionate
ethylestrenol is or has also been marketed for veterinary use under the brand names nandoral nitrotain and oestrotain
the availability of ethylestrenol is very limited
it appears to be available only in australia and new zealand and in these countries only for veterinary use
ethylestrenol along with other aas is a schedule iii controlled substance in the united states under the controlled substances act
