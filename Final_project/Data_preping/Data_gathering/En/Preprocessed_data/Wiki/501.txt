Ethylestrenol also known as ethyloestrenol or ethylnandrol and sold under the brand names Maxibolin and Orabolin among others is an androgen and anabolic steroid AAS medication which has been used in the past for a variety of indications such as to promote weight gain and to treat anemia and osteoporosis but has been discontinued for use in humans It is still available for veterinary use in Australia and New Zealand however It is taken by mouth
Side effects of ethylestrenol include symptoms of masculinization like acne increased hair growth voice changes and increased sexual desire It can also cause liver damage The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor AR the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone DHT It has strong anabolic effects relative to its androgenic effects The drug also has strong progestogenic effects Ethylestrenol is a prodrug of norethandrolone
Ethylestrenol was first described in and was introduced for medical use in In addition to its medical use ethylestrenol has been used to improve physique and performance However it is described as a very weak muscle builder compared to other AAS and in relation to this has not been commonly used for such purposes The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non medical use is generally illicit
Ethylestrenol has been used for a variety of indications including
To promote weight gain and muscle growth
As an adjunct in the treatment of bone pain and decreased bone strength associated with osteoporosis
As an adjunct for catabolic states such as corticosteroid therapy and convalescence as in chronic infections extensive surgery and severe trauma

Side effects of ethylestrenol include virilization among others
As an AAS ethylestrenol is an agonist of the androgen receptor AR similarly to androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone DHT It has low estrogenic activity via aromatization into ethylestradiol following transformation into norethandrolone strong progestogenic activity and a high ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity similarly to other nandrolone derivatives Like other α alkylated AAS ethylestrenol has a risk of hepatotoxicity
Ethylestrenol has very low affinity for human serum sex hormone binding globulin SHBG less than of that of testosterone and less than of that of DHT It is known to be metabolized into the closely related AAS norethandrolone α ethyl nortestosterone in the body and has been regarded as a prodrug of norethandrolone This is in accordance with its very low affinity for the androgen receptor only about of that of testosterone and of that of dihydrotestosterone
Ethylestrenol also known as deketo α ethyl nortestosterone or as α ethylestr en β ol is a synthetic estrane steroid and a α alkylated derivative of nandrolone nortestosterone NT It is specifically the α ethyl and deketo derivative of nandrolone as well as the deketo derivative of norethandrolone α ethyl NT Other related AAS include bolenol deketo α ethyl nor androstenediol ethyldienolone α ethyl δ NT norboletone α ethyl methyl NT propetandrol α ethyl NT β propionate and tetrahydrogestrinone THG α ethyl methyl δ NT The progestins allylestrenol deketo α allyl NT and lynestrenol deketo α ethynyl NT are also closely related to ethylestrenol differing only by the Cα substitution
Ethylestrenol was described in the literature in and approved for medical use in and in the United States in
Ethylestrenol is the generic name of the drug and its INN USAN and BAN while éthylestrénol is its DCF and ethylnandrol is its JAN The BAN was formerly ethyloestrenol but it was eventually changed
