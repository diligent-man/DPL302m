The Battle of Cape Gloucester was fought in the Pacific theater of World War II between Japanese and Allied forces on the island of New Britain Territory of New Guinea between December and January Codenamed Operation Backhander the US landing formed part of the wider Operation Cartwheel the main Allied strategy in the South West Pacific Area and Pacific Ocean Areas during It was the second landing the US st Marine Division had conducted during the war thus far after Guadalcanal The objective of the operation was to capture the two Japanese airfields near Cape Gloucester that were defended by elements of the Japanese th Division
The main landing came on December when US Marines landed on either side of the peninsula The western landing force acted as a diversion and cut the coastal road near Tauali to restrict Japanese freedom of movement while the main force landing on the eastern side advanced north towards the airfields The advance met light resistance at first but was slowed by the swampy terrain which channeled the US troops onto a narrow coastal trail A Japanese counterattack briefly slowed the advance but by the end of December the airfields had been captured and consolidated by the Marines Fighting continued into early January as the US troops extended their perimeter south from the airfields towards Borgen Bay Organized resistance ceased on January when US troops captured Hill however mopping up operations in the vicinity continued into April until the Marines were relieved by US Army forces
Cape Gloucester is a headland that sits on the northern peninsula at the west end of the island of New Britain which lies to the northeast of mainland New Guinea It is roughly opposite to the Huon Peninsula from which it is separated by Rooke Island with the intervening sea lane divided into the Vitiaz and Dampier Straits At the time of the battle it was part of the Territory of New Guinea It is miles km west of Rabaul and miles km northeast of Port Moresby The peninsula on which Cape Gloucester sits consists of a rough semi circular coast extending from Lagoon Point in the west to Borgen Bay in the east At the base of the peninsula is Mount Talawe a foot m extinct volcano which runs laterally east to west Southwest of Talawe a semi active volcano Langila rises feet m while further to the south a second extinct volcano Mount Tangi rises to feet m The area is densely vegetated with thick rainforest sharp kunai grass and deep mangrove swamps In there were only a few beaches suitable for landing operations and there were no roads around the coast along which troops and vehicles could quickly advance
Temperatures ranged from to °F to °C with high humidity Rainfall was heavy especially during the northwest monsoon season that ran until February Air operations in this period could be mounted from Finschhafen but after February the climate there was expected to restrict air operations which would have to be conducted from Cape Gloucester The climate dictated the timetable for the Cape Gloucester operation In an Allied intelligence survey of the area estimated the local population around Cape Gloucester at around There were numerous villages spread across four main areas on the western coast near Kalingi on the western bank of the Itini River in the south inland from Sag Sag and towards Tauali on the western coast and to the east of Mount Tangi around Niapaua Agulupella and Relmen Prior to the Japanese invasion of New Britain in there had been two European missions around Cape Gloucester a Roman Catholic mission at Kalingi and an Anglican one at Sag Sag
Before the war a landing ground had been established on the relatively flat ground that lay at the apex of the peninsula Following the Japanese invasion of New Britain in early the landing ground had been developed into two airstrips the larger of the two being feet m long The area was assessed by Allied intelligence as largely being unsuitable for large scale development with reefs to the south west and north hampering the movement of large vessels and a lack of protected anchorages suitable for such vessels The few areas suitable for such vessels were open to the sea and were not considered perennial being affected by the changing seasons Nevertheless small craft could operate along the coast and Borgen Bay had been developed into a staging area for barge operations between mainland New Guinea and the main Japanese base around Rabaul on the eastern end of New Britain
By late the fighting in New Guinea had turned in the favor of the Allies after a period of hard fighting The Japanese drive on Port Moresby during and early had been defeated during the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Kokoda Track campaign The Japanese beachhead at Buna Gona was subsequently destroyed albeit with many casualties The Japanese had been forced to abandon their efforts on Guadalcanal and the Allies had secured the Salamaua region The Allies then seized the initiative and implemented Operation Cartwheel a series of subordinate operations aimed at the reduction of the Japanese base at Rabaul and the severing of lines of communication in the South West Pacific Area as the Allies advanced towards the Philippines where operations were planned for The Australians had secured Lae by September and operations to capture the Huon Peninsula had begun in earnest shortly after to secure Finschafen before a drive on Saidor A secondary effort pushed inland from Lae through the Markham and Ramu Valleys with the two drives eventually aiming towards Madang As Allied forces began to make headway on the Huon Peninsula Allied attention then turned to securing their seaward flank on the other side of the Vitiaz and Dampier Straits
On September General Douglas MacArthur issued orders for the invasion of New Britain codenamed Operation Dexterity This operation was conceived with several phases with the broad Allied scheme of maneuver being to secure all of New Britain west of the line between Gasmata and Talasea on the north coast Within this scheme Operation Backhander was a landing around Cape Gloucester aimed at the capture and expansion of two Japanese military airfields This was to contribute to the increased isolation and harassment of the major Japanese base at Rabaul which was subjected to heavy aerial bombing in October and November as part of ongoing efforts to neutralize the large Japanese garrison there without the need to assault it head on A secondary goal was to ensure free Allied sea passage through the straits separating New Britain from New Guinea Amongst Allied commanders there was some debate about the necessity of invading New Britain Lieutenant General George Kenney the US air commander believed that the landing at Cape Gloucester was unnecessary He believed that it would take too long for the airfields to be developed and that the pace of Allied advance would ultimately outstrip their usefulness Nevertheless army and naval commanders felt it was necessary to secure convoy routes through the Vitiaz Strait to support operations in western New Guinea and to the north
The landing at Gasmata was later cancelled and replaced with a diversionary landing around Arawe with the plan being to potentially establish a PT boat base there Believing that the Allies could not bypass Rabaul as they attempted to advance towards the Japanese inner perimeter and would seek to capture it as quickly as possible the Japanese sought to maintain a sizeable force for the defense of Rabaul thus reducing the forces available for the defense of western New Britain
Responsibility for the seizure of western New Britain was given to Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Alamo Force For the Cape Gloucester operation US planners assigned the st Marine Division Major General William H Rupertus which had previously fought on Guadalcanal The operation would be the st Marine Division's second landing of the war Initial planning had envisaged an airborne landing from the rd Parachute Infantry near the airfields in conjunction with a two pronged seaborne landing either side of the cape with two battalions of the th Marine Regiment advancing on the airfields from the beaches north of Borgen Bay while another blocked ingress and egress routes along the opposite coast around Tauali However the airborne landing was later removed from the plan due to concerns about overcrowding of staging airfields and possible delays due to weather To compensate the size of the seaborne assault forces was increased The main force assigned to the assault was drawn from the th Marine Regiment Colonel Julian N Frisbie reinforced by the st Marine Regiment Colonel William J Whaling In addition the th Marine Regiment Colonel John T Selden formed the reserve Artillery was provided by the th Marines Colonel Robert H Pepper and later Colonel William H Harrison These troops were organized into three combat teams designated 'A' to 'C' the th Marines formed Combat Team 'A' the st Marines formed Combat Team 'B' and the th Marines were Combat Team 'C'
In mid elements of the st Marine Division had still been in Australia where they had been withdrawn following the fighting on Guadalcanal Around this time preliminary landing rehearsals had been conducted around Port Phillip Bay prior to the division's movement to the forward assembly areas in New Guinea in August and September however the majority of Allied amphibious assets were tied up with operations around the Huon Peninsula which meant that only limited rehearsals could take place until after November The combat teams moved into three staging locations Milne Bay Cape Sudest and Goodenough Island after which further practice landings were conducted around the Taupota Bay area before they concentrated at Cape Sudest in the Oro Bay area southeast of Buna in December
The US troops were opposed by elements of the Japanese th Division Lieutenant General Yasushi Sakai which had previously served in China before arriving on New Britain in October and November These troops were known as Matsuda Force after their commander Major General Iwao Matsuda and consisted of the th Brigade with the rd and st Infantry Regiments and elements of the th Shipping Group These troops were supported by field and anti aircraft artillery and a variety of supporting elements including engineers and signals troops Just prior to the battle there were troops in the vicinity of Cape Gloucester Matsuda's headquarters had been at Kalingi along the coastal trail northwest of Mount Talawe within miles km of the Cape Gloucester airfields but after the Allied bombardment prior to the battle it had been moved to Egaroppu closer to Borgen Bay The headquarters at Kalingi was taken over by the Colonel Koki Sumiya commander of the rd Infantry Regiment which defended the airfields primarily with the regiment's st Battalion supported by elements of two artillery battalions a heavy weapons company and a battalion of anti aircraft guns The nd Battalion rd Infantry Regiment was in reserve around Nakarop while the st Infantry Regiment Colonel Kenshiro Katayama was positioned well to the south around Cape Bushing At the time of the fighting around Cape Gloucester the effectiveness of these troops had been degraded by disease and lack of supplies due to interdiction of the Japanese coastal supply barges Air support was available from the naval th Air Fleet and th Air Division
The landing on Cape Gloucester was scheduled for December Prior to the operation planners directed that a stockpile of supplies enough for a month of combat operations be built up around Oro Bay and this was in place by December and would be shuttled to Cape Gloucester by landing craft as required The day before supporting operations began when the US Army th Cavalry Regiment landed at Arawe on the south central coast to block the route of Japanese reinforcements and supplies from east to west and as a diversion from the Cape Gloucester landings The operation around Arawe succeeded in diverting about Japanese troops from Cape Gloucester
For several months before the landings the area around the airfields and the coastal plain between Cape Gloucester and Natamo south of Borgen Bay was bombed by Allied aircraft mainly from the US Fifth Air Force Japanese entrenchments were destroyed and the airfields around Cape Gloucester were put out of action from November A total of sorties were launched by US aircraft around Cape Gloucester with the expenditure of almost rounds of ammunition and tonnes kg of bombs Diversionary air raids were also made by AirSols aircraft in the days before the assault focused on the Japanese airfields around Rabaul while naval aircraft bombed Kavieng Raids were also launched against Madang and Wewak Meanwhile the Allies undertook extensive aerial reconnaissance of the area while ground teams of Marines Alamo Scouts and Coastwatchers were landed at various locations except Borgen Bay over three separate occasions from PT boats between September and December
Japanese defensive planning was focused upon holding the airfield sector Bunkers trenches and fortified positions were built along the coast to the east and west with the strongest position being established to the southeast to defend against an approach through the flat grasslands A complex was also established at the base of Mount Talawe affording a commanding view of the airfields which were held by a battalion of infantry supported by service troops and several artillery pieces To the east of the peninsula the beaches around Silimati Point which were bounded by heavy swamps were largely left unfortified the Japanese defensive scheme based on holding several high features Target Hill and Hill and maintaining control of lateral tracks rapidly to move forces in response to an attack
The Allied plan called for a two pronged landing at several beaches to the east and west of the peninsula followed by an advance north towards the airfields at Cape Gloucester Final rehearsals were carried out on December after which the troops embarked on their vessels early on Christmas Day at Oro Bay and Cape Cretin near Finschhafen The convoy designated Task Force under Rear Admiral Daniel E Barbey consisted of nine APDs Landing Craft Infantry LCIs Landing Ship Tank LSTs Landing Craft Mechanized LCMs and Landing Craft Tank LCTs escorted by destroyers as well as the task force flagship Conyngham three minesweepers and two rocket carrying DUKWs that were carried aboard the LCMs These two amphibians would support the western landings while two LCIs had been similarly modified to support the eastern landing
The troops were carried aboard the APDs while the LSTs carried the heavy vehicles including bulldozers tanks and trucks In order to supply the force a total of days of supply of rations was detailed for assault troops while the follow on troops were to land with days of supply Both groups were to carry three units of ammunition resupply while five days were needed for anti aircraft weapons Nevertheless space was at a premium and in some instances this could not be met In order to speed up the unloading process and reduce congestion on the eastern beaches a mobile loading scheme was devised with the supplies preloaded directly on ton trucks These vehicles would arrive on the beaches with the first echelon that would land the assault troops in the morning and would be able to drive straight off the LSTs and unload their cargo at several dumps ashore before re embarking on LSTs assigned to the second echelon that would land in the afternoon on the first day with the follow on troops Medical teams including doctors and corpsmen were assigned to each transport and some LSTs and these personnel would form part of an evacuation chain that would see casualties transported back to Cape Sudest where an bed floating hospital was established aboard an LST which would serve as a casualty receiving station prior to onward movement to base hospitals ashore
This force was escorted by United States Navy USN and Royal Australian Navy RAN cruisers and destroyers from Task Force under Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley of the Royal Navy Maintaining a speed of knots the convoy proceeded through the Vitiaz Strait towards Cape Gloucester traversing between Rooke and Sakar Islands As they made their way towards their objective Allied patrol boats operated to the north and western approaches in the Dampier Strait and the southern coast of New Britain While heading towards their objective the convoy was spotted by a Japanese reconnaissance plane as well as an observer around Cape Ward Hunt As a result their progress was reported to Rabaul However the commander of the Japanese Southeast Area Fleet Admiral Jinichi Kusaka incorrectly assessed that the convoy was bound for Arawe as reinforcements and subsequently ordered a heavy air attack there instead of around Cape Gloucester with Zero fighters and bombers from Rabaul
The main operation began just after dawn on December with a naval barrage on the Japanese positions on the cape followed by air attacks by the United States Army Air Forces USAAF and Royal Australian Air Force RAAF A total of squadrons from the st Air Task Force under Brigadier General Frederick A Smith were provided for close air support of which nine were bomber squadrons and five were attack In addition several fighter squadrons flew combat air patrols to negate the threat from Japanese aircraft one squadron covered the approaching convoy three would cover the landing beaches and another would cover the seaborne elements that would withdraw in the afternoon These attacks and an aerial smoke screen were followed by the landing of the st Marine Division at Yellow Beaches and to the east near Silimati Point and Borgen Bay about miles km southeast of the airfield and a diversion at Green Beach to the west at Tauali about miles km from Cape Gloucester The main assault came at Silimati Point with only one battalion landing in the west After being transported aboard the APDs from Cape Sudest the force came ashore aboard landing craft of various types including LSTs and LCIs
The diversionary western landing at Tauali Green Beach on the Dampier Strait side of the peninsula was assigned to Landing Team LT consisting of the nd Battalion st Marines with a battery of artillery from the th Marines Escorted by two destroyers and two patrol boats the force was embarked upon landing craft of various types five LCIs LCTs and LCMs They carried with them days of rations and six units of artillery ammunition After departing Oro Bay with the main convoy this force had broken off around Finschhafen and proceeded on its own through the Dampier Strait After a preliminary naval and aerial bombardment around the Japanese defenses around Green Beach were found abandoned LT experienced no opposition coming ashore preceded by heavy preparatory fires including rockets fired from several amphibious vehicles The beachhead was established by and all first day objectives had been secured by Due to interference from the surrounding terrain the Marines were unable to raise their divisional headquarters and were instead had to relay messages through headquarters Sixth Army Alamo Force By nightfall the Marines had secured a perimeter and had cut the coast road establishing a road block This prevented the Japanese from using it to reinforce their positions around the airfields but a secondary route to the east of Mount Talawe remained open to the Japanese having gone undetected by US intelligence
Shortly after the western landing the Japanese dispatched two companies of the rd Infantry Regiment to respond In the days that followed the Marines clashed with small groups of Japanese and Japanese artillery and mortars fired on the US perimeter from Dorf Point Patrol clashes increased until early morning on December when the two companies of the rd Infantry attacked the Marines around Coffin Corner exploiting the concealment of a heavy storm and darkness to launch a concentrated assault along a narrow avenue of approach between two defended ridges Supported with mortars machine guns and artillery a five hour firefight followed before the assault was turned back Casualties amounted to killed and five captured for the Japanese against six Marines killed and wounded Following this there were no further assaults on the western perimeter Artillery fell on the position on December but was met counterbattery fire from the th Marines who labored to get their guns into action despite the terrain Although the Japanese sought mainly to avoid contact as most withdrew to support the fighting on the east coast patrol actions continued throughout early January when contact was established around Dorf Point with a company sized patrol from the th Marines that had set out overland from the eastern lodgment The wounded and heavy equipment were subsequently embarked on January having been hampered by poor weather previously and LT then collapsed its position marching east towards the airfields and on January they linked up with the main body of US troops who had captured the airfields in late December
The remainder of Task Force consisting of APDs LCIs and LSTs were allocated to the eastern zone Yellow Beaches and The th Marines were to go ashore first and were tasked with securing the beachhead while the st Marines less the battalion assigned to the diversionary landing around Tauali would follow them up after the initial assault and would pass through their lines to begin the advance north towards the airfield The th Marines would remain embarked as a floating commander's reserve and would only be released on Krueger's orders
As the task force moved into position the approaches to the beach were marked and cleared during the darkness and at an hour and minutes prior to H Hour a heavy naval bombardment began with the cruisers engaging targets around the airfields as well as around the beaches and towards Target Hill As H Hour approached the escorting destroyers also joined in the bombardment followed by a carefully co ordinated aerial bombing raid with five squadrons of B s and one squadron of B s attacking Target Hill The first wave of assault troops disembarked from the APDs and were loaded into Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel LCVPs six were bound for Yellow and the other six for Yellow While the APDs withdrew the LCVPs began their run to the shore After the B s made a final strafing run over the beach two rocket equipped LCIs stationed to the flanks fired onto the beach defenses
Drifting smoke from the aerial bombardment of Target Hill obscured the beaches and the approaches and briefly hampered the landing with some troops coming ashore in the wrong spot Nevertheless the first wave made landfall around Yellow one minute after H Hour followed two minutes later at Yellow There was no opposition in the vicinity of these two beaches but the small group from the rd Battalion th Marines which landed yards m northwest of Yellow by mistake came under fire from machine guns firing at maximum range from a number of bunkers after pushing through the thick jungle to locate the coastal trail Throughout the morning follow up troops from the remainder of the st Marines came ashore and pushed through the th Marines to begin the advance north towards the airfields The landing area to the north of Borgen Bay was surrounded largely by swamp with only a small narrow beach along which the Marine infantry and their supporting Sherman tanks from the st Tank Battalion could advance towards the airfields This slowed the advance inland and resulted in heavy congestion on the beaches hampering the unloading process
After initially being diverted towards Arawe in the morning Japanese aircraft after refueling and rearming at Rabaul began attacking the Allied ships around the landing beaches around resulting in the loss of the destroyer USS Brownson with over a hundred of her crew and casualties aboard the destroyers USS Shaw and Mugford Nevertheless around troops and about tons of equipment were pushed ashore during the first day of the operation on either side of the cape and the attacking Japanese aircraft suffered losses to US fighters and ship borne anti aircraft fire Opposition in the main landing area was limited initially to rear area troops that had been overrun but a hasty counterattack by the nd Battalion rd Infantry Regiment Major Shinichi Takabe which had marched from Nakarop lasted through the afternoon and evening of the first day falling mainly against the nd Battalion th Marines under Lieutenant Colonel Odell M Conoley By the end of the day the th Marines held the beachhead while the th Marines had brought their artillery pieces ashore and the st Marines had begun a slow advance north forced into a long column along the narrow trail
The following day the Marines advanced westward pushing miles km towards their objective before reaching a Japanese blocking position identified by the Marines as Hell's Point on the eastern side of the airfields This position was well concealed and equipped with anti tank and mm field guns Teams from the th Naval Construction Battalion designated as the rd Battalion th Marines worked to improve the routes along which the US forces were advancing as large quantities of supplies were landed Amphibian landing vehicles were used to ferry ammunition forward but the volume of traffic coupled with the heavy rain churned up the narrow coastal road As a result the movement of combat supplies forward from Yellow Beach as well as evacuation of the wounded back from the engagement areas proved difficult On December a secondary landing beach Blue Beach was established about miles km closer to the fighting to reduce the distance supplies had to travel ashore At the same time the blocking position was attacked and US armor was brought up Nine Marines were killed and were wounded while Japanese losses amounted to at least killed
The th Marines which had been in reserve for the initial landing were landed on December There was some confusion during the landing due to a last minute change in orders for the regiment to land on Blue Beach instead of Yellow Beach and As a result the regiment came ashore in both locations with those who arrived on the Yellow Beaches route marching to Blue Beach or being ferried by truck After establishing themselves ashore the th Marines carried out a flanking move to the south west while the st Marine Regiment continued to advance along the coast By the end of the day the Marines had broken through the Japanese defenses and were in control of most of the airfield Japanese air attacks ended on December when bad weather set in This was followed by much US air activity around Rabaul which prevented further air attacks on Cape Gloucester During the final days of December the Marines overran the airfield and expanded their perimeter incorporating Razorback Ridge a key feature about yards m to the south of No Strip running north to south In early January Company E from the nd Battalion th Marines effected a link up with the western lodgment around Dorf Point on the western coast
In the weeks that followed the capture of the airfield US troops pushed south towards Borgen Bay to extend the perimeter beyond Japanese artillery range In this time further actions were fought by the th and th Marines against the remnants of the rd Infantry Regiment and the st Infantry Regiment which had undertaken a march north across difficult terrain from Cape Bushing following the initial landings On January there was a sharp engagement around Suicide Creek when the advancing Marines came up against a heavily entrenched defending force from the rd Infantry Held up by strong defenses that were well concealed amongst the dense jungle the Marines were halted and dug in temporarily around Suicide Creek The following day a reinforced company from the Japanese st Infantry Regiment launched an unsuccessful counterattack on the US troops around Target Hill This was followed by renewed fighting around Suicide Creek as the Japanese put up a stubborn defense which was eventually overcome with the assistance of tanks and artillery on January
After reorganizing on January US troops secured Aogiri Ridge and Hill on January This was followed by an action towards the high ground around Hill Slowed by bad weather rugged terrain and Japanese resistance progress for the Marines around Hill was slow The position was finally secured on January following three days of fighting in which Marines and over Japanese were killed The capture of this position represented the end of Japanese defensive operations in the Cape Gloucester and Borgen Bay areas Following this Matsuda withdrew with around troops ceding the area to the Americans who captured his command post intact
The Base Engineer and his operations staff landed on December and completed a reconnaissance of the two Japanese airfields by December They found that they were feet m deep in kunai grass and that the Japanese had neither attempted to construct proper drainage nor to re grade the airstrips They decided not to proceed with any work on No Airstrip and to concentrate on No The th Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived on January followed by the th Engineer Aviation Battalion on January and the st Engineer Aviation Battalion on January Work hours were limited by blackout restrictions imposed by the Task Force Commander which limited work to daylight hours until January and by heavy and continuous rain from December until January averaging inches mm a week Grading removed to feet to m of material mostly kunai humus from two thirds of the area The subgrade was then stabilized with red volcanic ash that had to be hauled from the nearest source miles km away Marston Mat was then laid over the top but this did not arrive until January resulting in further delay By January feet m of runway was usable and by March a foot m runway was complete Natural obstacles prevented the runway being lengthened to feet m as originally planned but there were four by foot by m alert areas hardstands a control tower taxiways access roads and facilities for four squadrons
A C had landed on the runway at Cape Gloucester in January followed by a C Lieutenant General Walter Krueger the commander of Alamo Force inspected the airstrip with Brigadier General Frederic H Smith Jr on January They estimated that the th Fighter Group could move in as early as January This did not prove feasible the airbase was not finished and was at capacity with transport aircraft bringing in much needed supplies The th Fighter Squadron arrived on February followed by the th Fighter Squadron on February Heavy rains made mud ooze up through the holes in the steel plank making the runway slick This did not bother the th Fighter Squadron which flew nimble and rugged P Kittyhawks but the P Lightnings of the th Fighter Group found themselves overshooting the short runway Major General Ennis C Whitehead the commander of the Fifth Air Force Advanced Echelon ADVON decided to move the th Fighter Group to Nadzab and replace it with RAAF Kittyhawk squadrons from Kiriwina No Wing RAAF began moving to Cape Gloucester on March No Squadron RAAF arrived on March followed by No Squadron RAAF on March and No Squadron RAAF two days later No Wing provided close air support for the st Marine Division assisted the PT boats offshore and provided vital air cover for convoys headed to the Admiralty Islands campaign Operations were maintained at a high tempo until April when No Wing was alerted to prepare for Operations Reckless and Persecution the landings at Hollandia Jayapura and Aitape
To support air operations US barrels l US gal imp gal of bulk petroleum storage was provided along with a tanker berth with connections to the five storage tanks which became operational in May The th Naval Construction Battalion worked on a rock filled pile and crib pier feet m long and feet m wide for Liberty ships It was not completed before the th Naval Construction Battalion left for the Russell Islands along with the st Marine Division in April Other works included square feet m of open storage square feet m of covered warehouse storage and cubic feet m of refrigerated storage a bed hospital was completed in May and a water supply system with a capacity of US gallons l imp gal per day was installed Despite problems obtaining suitable road surface materials miles km of two lane all weather roads were provided surfaced with sand clay volcanic ash and beach gravel Timber was obtained locally and a sawmill operated by the st Engineer Aviation Battalion produced board feet m of lumberCasualties during operations to secure Cape Gloucester amounted to killed and wounded for the Americans Japanese losses exceeded killed in the December to January period Ultimately according to historian John Miller Cape Gloucester never became an important air base Plans to move Thirteenth Air Force units there were cancelled in August In assessing the operation historians such as Miller and Samuel Eliot Morison have argued that it was of limited strategic importance in achieving the Allied objectives of Operation Cartwheel Morison called it a waste of time and effort Nevertheless the airstrip played a vital role in supporting the Admiralty Islands operation commencing in February and as an emergency landing field for aircraft damaged in raids on Kavieng and Rabaul it remained in use until April In June the base at Cape Gloucester became part of Base F at Finschhafen
Elsewhere US and Australian forces conducted the Landing on Long Island miles km to the northwest where a radar station was established in December Alamo Force switched its attention to the landing at Saidor in January as part of the next stage of operations in New Guinea In mid January the th Division commander Yasushi Sakai sought permission to withdraw his command from western New Britain On February US patrols from Cape Gloucester and Arawe linked up around Gilnit A company from the st Marines landed on Rooke Island on February aboard six LCMs to ensure it was clear of Japanese troops After coming shore unopposed the Marines sent out patrols to reconnoiter the island Finding it abandoned they returned to Cape Gloucester on the th Commencing on February the Japanese forces sought to disengage from the Americans in western New Britain and move towards the Talasea area Marine patrols kept up the pressure with several minor engagements being fought in the center of the island and along its north coast
Mopping up operations around Cape Gloucester continued throughout early although by February the situation had stabilized enough for US planners to begin preparations to expand the lodgment further east In early March the Americans launched an operation to capture Talasea on the northern coast of New Britain while following up a general Japanese withdrawal towards Cape Hoskins and Rabaul The st Marine Division was relieved around Cape Gloucester on April and were replaced by the US Army's th Infantry Division which arrived from Guadalcanal A lull on New Britain followed as the US confined their operations largely to the western end of the island having decided to bypass Rabaul while the Japanese stayed close to Rabaul at the opposite end of the island Responsibility for operations on New Britain was later transferred from US forces to the Australians In November they conducted the Landing at Jacquinot Bay for a limited offensive with the Battle of Wide Bay Open Bay securing the bays to confine the larger Japanese force to the Gazelle Peninsula where they remained until the end of the war
