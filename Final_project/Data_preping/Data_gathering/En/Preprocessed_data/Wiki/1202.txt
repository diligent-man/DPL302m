The Lockheed L Starliner was the last model of the Lockheed Constellation line of airliners Powered by four Wright R TurboCompound engines it was built at Lockheed's Burbank California plant from to
Development of the Starliner began when Lockheed designed the L in response to the Douglas DC C Seven Seas Powered by four hp Pratt Whitney PTG turboprop engines the L would have cruised faster than the DC C with comparable range with US gal imp gal l of fuel in a new ft m wing Pratt Whitney dropped the PT project in March due to expected unreliability high specific fuel consumption and high operating costs though the T military version of the engine powered the Douglas C freighter which was also plagued with unreliability
The L would have been about in cm longer than the L series with a maximum gross takeoff weight MGTOW of lb kg The L replaced the in early with an additional in cm stretch and MGTOW of lb kg presumably still with the PT turboprops
Lockheed told Trans World Airlines TWA on September the L would use the same fuselage as the series Hughes Tool Company ordered in December though TWA estimated the L would lose money even with every seat occupied When PW dropped their engine Lockheed proposed an L with Allison turboprops but TWA and Lockheed agreed on the piston engine L instead and so amended the L contract In April Lockheed told TWA that they wanted to drop the but Hughes refused to agree
Though the L and L were never built all Constellations from onwards were strengthened to take the thrust generated by the TPT turboprops which were fitted to several RV Constellations for the United States Navy USN
With the abandonment of the L Lockheed designed a less ambitious upgrade of the Constellation series as the L A Starliner The new design used the L G fuselage the new ft m wing and four Wright R TC EA turbocompound radial engines allowing the Starliner to fly nonstop from California to Europe Lockheed said the new L A would deliver passengers over a range of mi km at mph kmh or from Paris to New York City three hours faster than the DC C In January Pan American scheduled the DC C from Orly to Idlewild in hr min TWA scheduled the in hr min
The L A prototype first flew on October The prototype N was the property of Lockheed until the early s when it was sold in Japan Airline service began on June on a Trans World Airlines TWA flight from New York to London and Frankfurt In September a Starliner made the first nonstop flight from Los Angeles to London this was captained by TWA’s chief pilot Bob Buck who wrote an extensive magazine article describing the experience
TWA called their L s Jetstreams and flew them on longer domestic routes and on flights from New York to Europe and beyond In July TWA scheduled flights a week from Europe to New York were L s including seven nonstops a week from Paris five from London four from Frankfurt two each from Madrid Lisbon and Geneva one from Zurich and one from Rome Three s a week flew the Polar route Europe to California sometimes nonstop
Boeing s replaced the last TWA transatlantic passenger L in October s and Convair s displaced them from domestic scheduled flights in December In the early s Lockheed converted twelve TWA Ls to freighters that carried cargo across the Atlantic until and domestically until
Air France bought ten Starliners they were the only airline to market the aircraft by its name being called the Super Starliner Transatlantic flights lasted from August until September when the Boeing took over Starting in April Air France L s flew from Paris to Anchorage to Tokyo but they were not allowed to fly to the west coast of the United States In summer they scheduled nonstop L s a week from Orly to Idlewild four of which continued to Mexico City two weekly L s flew from Orly to Montreal to Chicago Midway and back The twice weekly ORY ANC TYO flight was scheduled for hr min compared to hr min for the fastest G via India and hr min for BOAC's Comet from London to Tokyo via India
Lufthansa was the last airline to purchase the Starliner new their four Starliners were marketed as Super Stars and flew transatlantic routes Lufthansa's Starliners were delivered nonstop to Hamburg from the Lockheed factory at Burbank In summer Lufthansa scheduled nonstops to New York from Frankfurt Düsseldorf and Orly Lockheed converted two of Lufthansa's Starliners to freighters after the Boeing had replaced them on the transatlantic passenger flights in
Linee Aeree Italiane LAI ordered four Starliners but did not take them up following the merger with Alitalia in October Alitalia had accepted the DC C and had no interest in the Starliners they were delivered to TWA in Varig ordered two Starliners but the order was switched to two L Gs
The DC C ended up selling more airframes than the Starliner which had greater range than its rival but was expensive USD and entered service a year later In the end only Starliners were built including the prototype compared to DC Cs
Alaska Airlines used two Starliners for MATS operations in the s Other operators used Starliners for charter flights A small number of Starliners were used as cargo aircraft in Alaska during the s By the early s all Starliners ceased commercial operations
Four Starliners still exist after ten years of work Lufthansa abandoned restoring one to flying condition Another was sent in for the TWA Hotel
Initial production version powered by four Wright R TC EA engines Built
Proposed turboprop version None builtJune TWA Flight crashed due to a lightning strike after taking off from Milan Malpensa Airport in Italy with the loss of all passengers and crew
May Air France Flight named De Grasse broke up in flight after empennage failure over the Sahara Desert thought to have been caused by an explosive device killing all passengers and crewFour Starliners still exist
NC cn at Auburn Lewiston Airport in Maine was being restored to flying condition by Lufthansa First flight of the restored aircraft was planned for sometime in to with the extensive restoration having been continuous since Lufthansa announced in March that it is moving restoration to Germany Decisions about further restoration will be made after it arrives in Germany but they are no longer planning to provide commercial flights
NH cn also at Auburn Lewiston Airport was being salvaged for parts for NC's restoration The aircraft has been restored and painted in s TWA livery for use as a cocktail lounge at the new TWA Hotel that opened on May at the former TWA terminal at John F Kennedy Airport
