north dakota farm girl esther victoria blodgett yearns to become a hollywood actress
although her aunt and father discourage such thoughts esther s grandmother gives esther her savings to follow her dream
esther goes to hollywood and tries to land a job as an extra but so many others have had the same idea that the casting agency has stopped accepting applications
esther is told that her chances of becoming a star are one in
she befriends a new resident at her boarding house assistant director danny mcguire himself out of work
when danny and esther go to a concert to celebrate danny s employment esther has her first encounter with norman maine an actor she admires greatly
norman has been a major star for years but his alcoholism has sent his career into a downward spiral
danny gets esther a one time waitressing job at a fancy hollywood party
while serving hors d uvres she catches norman s eye
he gets his longtime producer and good friend oliver niles to give her a screen test
impressed oliver gives her a new name vicki lester and a contract
she practices her few lines for her first tiny role
when the studio has trouble finding a female lead for norman s current film entitled the enchanted hour norman persuades oliver to cast esther
the film makes her an overnight success even as viewers continue to lose interest in norman
norman proposes to esther she accepts when he promises to give up drinking
they elope without publicity much to press agent matt libby s disgust and enjoy a trailer camping honeymoon in the mountains
when they return esther s popularity continues to skyrocket while norman realizes that his own career is over despite oliver s attempts to help him
norman stays sober for a while but his frustration over his situation finally pushes him over the edge and he starts drinking again
when esther wins the industry s top award the academy award for best actress he interrupts her acceptance speech by drunkenly demanding three awards for the worst acting of the year and accidentally slapping her when he dramatically swings his arms back
a stay at a sanatorium seems to cure norman s increasingly disruptive alcoholism but a chance encounter with libby allows the press agent to vent his long concealed contempt
norman goes on a four day drinking binge and winds up arrested for drunk driving
in court the judge sentences him to days of incarceration but esther pleads with the judge to put norman under her care
the judge who is impressed with esther s acting success suspends norman s sentence and puts norman s custody into esther s hands
esther decides to give up her career to devote herself to his rehabilitation
after norman overhears her discussing her plan with oliver he drowns himself in the pacific ocean
shattered esther decides to quit and go home
showing up soon afterward is her grandmother who has heard that esther is quitting
her grandmother tells her of a letter norman sent her when they got married
the letter stated how proud he was of esther and how much he loved her
because of her grandmother s words and the reminder of norman s deep love esther is convinced to stay in show business
at the premiere of her next film at grauman s chinese theatre when esther is asked to say a few words into the microphone to her many fans listening across the world she announces hello everybody
this is mrs
norman maine
a star is born was filmed from october to december with an estimated budget of and premiered in los angeles on april at grauman s chinese theatre
the film s new york premiere took place two days later at radio city music hall
it is not known how much dorothy parker contributed to the finished script
when she first saw the film parker was proud of her contribution and boasted about both the script and the film but in later life she believed that she had contributed nothing of significance
early in their careers budd schulberg then a script reader for david o
selznick and ring lardner jr
who was working in selznick s publicity department were assigned to write some additional dialogue for the film a collaboration which produced janet gaynor s and the film s final words this is mrs
norman maine the line was used again in the warner bros
musical remake starring judy garland and james mason
george cukor who directed the remake suggested adding the scene in the film in which menjou offers the fading star a supporting role
janet gaynor was given the first oscar for best actress at the first academy awards ceremony on may
in the scene in which vicky lester wins an oscar it is janet gaynor s very own oscar she is holding
in a subsequent scene the same oscar is seen sitting on a shelf
fredric march had won the oscar for best actor on november th for the film dr
jekyll and mr
hyde he tied with wallace beery for the champ film
although norman maine states that he won an award statue and the name oscar is never mentioned on screen it is presumably an oscar
unlike janet gaynor however fredric march s real oscar is never seen
some film historians believe that the marriage of barbara stanwyck and frank fay was the film s real life inspiration
john bowers has also been identified as inspiration for the norman maine character and the dramatic suicide by drowning scene near the end of the film bowers drowned in november
the film contains several inside jokes including gaynor s brief imitations of greta garbo katharine hepburn and mae west the crawford smear referring to joan crawford s lipstick and the revelation that the glamorous norman maine s real last name is hinkle
hinkle was the real last name of silent film star agnes ayres and not far removed from fredric march s real last name bickel
this film also has many similarities to the earlier film what price hollywood released by rko radio pictures
the film s original title was the truth about hollywood based on a story by adela rogers st
johns
johns loosely based her plot on the experiences of actress colleen moore and her husband alcoholic producer john mccormick and the life and death of director tom forman who committed suicide following a nervous breakdown
four years after what price hollywood was released selznick approached george cukor and asked him to direct a star is born
cukor felt the plot was too similar to what price hollywood so he declined
rko executives considered filing a plagiarism suit against selznick international pictures because of the similarities in the story but eventually chose not to take legal action
cukor later directed the musical remake starring judy garland
a common hollywood myth about the film is that lana turner appeared as an extra in one of the scenes in the film
turner often denied the myth over the years mentioning that she was discovered several months after the picture had finished production
the title theme a star is born was recorded by buddy clark with the orchestra of eddy duchin
the lyrics were written by dorothy dick to the music of max steiner
contemporary reviews were very positive
frank s
nugent of the new york times called the film one of the year s best shows as well as good entertainment by any standards including the artistic and convincing proof that hollywood need not travel to ruritania for its plots there is drama aplenty in its own backyard variety raved a smash which unquestionably will rate among the half dozen best of the season
while the story is somewhat reminiscent of other behind the scene yarns the manner of its telling makes it convincing and distinguished harrison s reports called it a powerful human interest drama and great entertainment film daily said it was superbly done in all departments and john mosher of the new yorker called it a pleasant movie with many nice touches
