In video games spawning is the live creation of a character item or NPC
Respawning is the recreation of an entity after its death or destruction perhaps after losing one of its lives
Despawning is the deletion of an entity from the game world
All player characters typically spawn at the start of a round whereas some objects or mobs may spawn after the occurrence of a particular event or delay
When a player character respawns they generally do so in an earlier point of the level and get some kind of penalty
The term was coined by id Software within the context of its game Doom
Spawn points are areas in a level where players spawn
In levels designed for team play these points are usually grouped so that each team spawns in their own tight area of the level
Spawn points are typically reserved for one team at any time and often have the ability to change hands to the other team
Some games even allow spawn points to be created by players using a beacon for example in Battlefield
Odd spawn points cause the player to be spawned as if actively entering the game world rather than merely appearing there
Regarding player-created spawn points the game Enemy Territory Quake Wars allows players utilizing the Strogg Technician class Strogg team version of GDF Medic class to create spawn hosts out of the bodies of fallen GDF enemies
Any player on the Strogg team can use any unused spawn host and the player upon death can use it to spawn closer to the objective or in a tactical location being effective tools for defending a location or advancing the front line
The spawn host disappears after the Strogg player respawns at its location so the spawn host can only be used once
Conversely players utilizing the GDF Medic class can disable and remove Strogg player-created spawn hosts by zapping them with their defibrillator pads
Spawn camping is a practice where a player waits near precise spawn points to kill enemies as they spawn
This is usually considered to be poor sportsmanship and some players even perceive it to be exploitative of the game itself
Most team-based games have some kind of protection against spawn camping such as a one-way door that only allows players to leave the spawn area permanent AI defences or perhaps a timer which kills enemies if they spend too long around the spawn area
Games with capturable spawn points will often leave some spawn points without this sort of camping protection
Spawn points for game objects are often abused in a similar fashion in game types such as role-playing games
In some games enemies may be respawned or equivalently new ones spawned to keep players on their toes and create tension or force players to move on making it too costly in resources andor too dangerous to stay in one place for too long
Enemies may visibly spawn or in more realistic games spawn outside the player's line of sight and move towards the player
Early games including monster respawning are Joust Doom and its sequel Doom II Hell on Earth
The enemies in these games had the ability to spawn from their teammates
In MMORPGs it is typical for monsters or mobs of monsters to continually respawn to allow all players a chance to fight
Some of these games implement instances which create a temporary copy of the game world and its characters reserved for a subset of players this allows each subset the chance to experience that part of the game without any interference from uninvited guests
In some games a player who has access to debugging or administrative tools can spawn entities or pickups with said tools
