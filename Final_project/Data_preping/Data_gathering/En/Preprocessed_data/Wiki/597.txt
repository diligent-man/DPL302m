pulcinella italian pronunciation pult i n lla neapolitan pulecenella is a classical character that originated in commedia dell arte of the th century and became a stock character in neapolitan puppetry
pulcinella s versatility in status and attitude has captivated audiences worldwide and kept the character popular in countless forms since his introduction to commedia dell arte by silvio fiorillo it in
pulcinella has his origins in two stock characters of the ancient roman atellan farce maccus and bucco
maccus is described as being witty sarcastic rude and cruel while bucco is a nervous thief who is as silly as he is full of himself
this duality manifested itself in both the way pulcinella is shaped and the way he acts
physically the characteristics he inherited from his ancestors attributed to his top heavy chicken like shape
he inherited his humpback his large crooked nose and his gangly legs from maccus
his potbelly large cheeks and gigantic mouth come from bucco
due to this duality of heredity pulcinella can be portrayed as either a servant or a master depending on the scenario
upper pulcinella is more like bucco with a scheming nature an aggressive sensuality and great intelligence
lower pulcinella however favors maccus and is described by pierre louis duchartre as being a dull and coarse bumpkin this juxtaposition of proud cunning thief from the upper class and loud crass pervert from the servant class is one that is key to understanding pulcinella s behaviors
pulcinella is a dualistic character he either plays dumb though he is very much aware of the situation or he acts as though he is the most intelligent and competent despite being woefully ignorant
he is incessantly trying to rise above his station though he does not intend to work for it
he is a social chameleon who tries to get those below him to think highly of him but is sure to appease those in positions of power
pulcinella s closing couplet translates to i am prince of everything lord of land and main
except for my public whose faithful servant i remain however because his world is often that of a servant he has no real investment in preserving the socio political world of his master
he is always on the side of the winner though he often does not decide this until after they have won
no matter his initial intent pulcinella always manages to win
if something ends poorly another thing is successful
if he is put out in a sense he is rewarded in another
this often accidental triumph is his normal
another important characteristic of pulcinella is that he fears nothing
he does not worry about consequences as he will be victorious no matter what
it is said that he is so wonderful to watch because he does what audience members would do were they not afraid of the consequences
pulcinella is the ultimate self preservationist looking out for himself in most every situation yet he still manages to sort out the affairs of everyone around him
antonio fava a world renowned maskmaker and maestro of commedia dell arte is particularly fond of the character in both performance and study due to his influence and continuity throughout history
fava explained that pulcinella a man without dignity is nevertheless indispensable to us all without him
none of his countless bosses could ever escape from the awkward tangle of troubles in which they find themselves
pulcinella is everyone s saviour saved by no one this accidental helpfulness is key to his success
he goes out of his way to avoid responsibility yet always ends up with more of it than he bargained for
his movements are broad and laborious allowing him to aggressively emphasize his speech and simultaneously exhausting him
he will also get excited about something and move very quickly and deliberately leaving him with no choice but to halt the action and catch his breath
he is to be thought of as a rebellious delinquent in the body of an old man
traditionally made of leather pulcinella s mask is either black or dark brown to imply weathering from the sun
his nose varies but is always the most prominent feature of the mask by far
it can be long and curved hooking over the mouth or it can be shorter with a more bulbous bridge
but either way the nose is to resemble a bird s beak
there is often a wart somewhere on the mask typically on the forehead or nose
furrowed eyebrows and deep wrinkles are also important though there is room for artistic interpretation there
he can have a protruding brow ridge knitted brows a furrowed brow or simply raised eyebrows
it is simply important that they are deeply wrinkled and prominent enough to match the exaggerated style of commedia dell arte masks
the mask used to feature a bushy black mustache or beard but this was mostly abandoned through the th century
most often portrayed in a baggy white ensemble consisting of a long sleeved loose fitting blouse with buttons down the front pulcinella pairs this with wide legged trousers the whole outfit complemented by a belt of sorts that cinches below the belly
this gives him a place to hold props while emphasizing his pot belly
a hat is always worn though the style can vary
typically it can either be a skull cap a hat with turn up brim a soft conical hat whose point lays down or a rigid sugar loaf hat
the sugar loaf hat gained popularity in the late th and early th centuries
each hat is white
pulcinella has two main props the first is a cudgel a relatively short stick often used primarily as a weapon
he calls this his staff of credit
his other prop is a coin purse traditionally attached to his belt so as to stay close to the body
a plausible theory derives his name from the diminutive or combination with pollastrello rooster of italian pulcino chick on account of his long beaklike nose as theorized by music historian francesco saverio quadrio or due to the squeaky nasal voice and timorous impotence in its demeanor according to giuseppe joseph baretti
according to another version pulcinella derived from the name of puccio d aniello a peasant of acerra who was portrayed in a famous picture attributed to annibale carracci and was characterized by a long nose
it has also been suggested that the figure is a caricature of a sufferer of acromegaly

mordini argues that pulcinella secrets are not really secret in the sense that they are unknown or unknowable but because they are labeled as secret
