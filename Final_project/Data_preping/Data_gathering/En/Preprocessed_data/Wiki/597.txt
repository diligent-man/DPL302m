Pulcinella Italian pronunciation pultʃiˈnɛlla Neapolitan Pulecenella is a classical character that originated in commedia dell'arte of the th century and became a stock character in Neapolitan puppetry Pulcinella's versatility in status and attitude has captivated audiences worldwide and kept the character popular in countless forms since his introduction to commedia dell'arte by Silvio Fiorillo it in
Pulcinella has his origins in two stock characters of the ancient Roman Atellan farce Maccus and Bucco Maccus is described as being witty sarcastic rude and cruel while Bucco is a nervous thief who is as silly as he is full of himself This duality manifested itself in both the way Pulcinella is shaped and the way he acts Physically the characteristics he inherited from his ancestors attributed to his top heavy chicken like shape He inherited his humpback his large crooked nose and his gangly legs from Maccus His potbelly large cheeks and gigantic mouth come from Bucco
Due to this duality of heredity Pulcinella can be portrayed as either a servant or a master depending on the scenario Upper Pulcinella is more like Bucco with a scheming nature an aggressive sensuality and great intelligence Lower Pulcinella however favors Maccus and is described by Pierre Louis Duchartre as being a dull and coarse bumpkin This juxtaposition of proud cunning thief from the upper class and loud crass pervert from the servant class is one that is key to understanding Pulcinella's behaviors
Pulcinella is a dualistic character he either plays dumb though he is very much aware of the situation or he acts as though he is the most intelligent and competent despite being woefully ignorant He is incessantly trying to rise above his station though he does not intend to work for it He is a social chameleon who tries to get those below him to think highly of him but is sure to appease those in positions of power Pulcinella's closing couplet translates to I am Prince of everything Lord of land and main Except for my public whose faithful servant I remain However because his world is often that of a servant he has no real investment in preserving the socio political world of his master He is always on the side of the winner though he often does not decide this until after they have won No matter his initial intent Pulcinella always manages to win If something ends poorly another thing is successful If he is put out in a sense he is rewarded in another This often accidental triumph is his normal Another important characteristic of Pulcinella is that he fears nothing He does not worry about consequences as he will be victorious no matter what It is said that he is so wonderful to watch because he does what audience members would do were they not afraid of the consequences
Pulcinella is the ultimate self preservationist looking out for himself in most every situation yet he still manages to sort out the affairs of everyone around him Antonio Fava a world renowned maskmaker and Maestro of Commedia dell'arte is particularly fond of the character in both performance and study due to his influence and continuity throughout history Fava explained that Pulcinella a man without dignity is nevertheless indispensable to us all without him none of his countless 'bosses' could ever escape from the awkward tangle of troubles in which they find themselves Pulcinella is everyone's saviour saved by no one This accidental helpfulness is key to his success He goes out of his way to avoid responsibility yet always ends up with more of it than he bargained for
His movements are broad and laborious allowing him to aggressively emphasize his speech and simultaneously exhausting him He will also get excited about something and move very quickly and deliberately leaving him with no choice but to halt the action and catch his breath He is to be thought of as a rebellious delinquent in the body of an old man
Traditionally made of leather Pulcinella's mask is either black or dark brown to imply weathering from the sun His nose varies but is always the most prominent feature of the mask by far It can be long and curved hooking over the mouth or it can be shorter with a more bulbous bridge But either way the nose is to resemble a bird's beak There is often a wart somewhere on the mask typically on the forehead or nose Furrowed eyebrows and deep wrinkles are also important though there is room for artistic interpretation there He can have a protruding brow ridge knitted brows a furrowed brow or simply raised eyebrows It is simply important that they are deeply wrinkled and prominent enough to match the exaggerated style of commedia dell'arte masks The mask used to feature a bushy black mustache or beard but this was mostly abandoned through the th century
Most often portrayed in a baggy white ensemble consisting of a long sleeved loose fitting blouse with buttons down the front Pulcinella pairs this with wide legged trousers the whole outfit complemented by a belt of sorts that cinches below the belly This gives him a place to hold props while emphasizing his pot belly A hat is always worn though the style can vary Typically it can either be a skull cap a hat with turn up brim a soft conical hat whose point lays down or a rigid sugar loaf hat The sugar loaf hat gained popularity in the late th and early th centuries Each hat is white
Pulcinella has two main props The first is a cudgel a relatively short stick often used primarily as a weapon He calls this his staff of credit His other prop is a coin purse traditionally attached to his belt so as to stay close to the body
A plausible theory derives his name from the diminutive or combination with pollastrello rooster of Italian pulcino chick on account of his long beaklike nose as theorized by music historian Francesco Saverio Quadrio or due to the squeaky nasal voice and timorous impotence in its demeanor according to Giuseppe Joseph Baretti
According to another version Pulcinella derived from the name of Puccio d'Aniello a peasant of Acerra who was portrayed in a famous picture attributed to Annibale Carracci and was characterized by a long nose It has also been suggested that the figure is a caricature of a sufferer of acromegaly
Many regional variants of Pulcinella were developed as the character diffused across Europe From its east to west coasts Europeans strongly identified with the tired witty everyman that Pulcinella represented In many later adaptations Pulcinella was portrayed as a puppet as commedia dell'arte style theatre did not continue to be popular throughout all of the continent over time He was said to evolve into Mr Punch in England The key half of Punch and Judy he is recognized as one of the most important British icons in history
The first recorded show to have involved the Punch style marionette was performed in England in May outside of London in Covent Garden by Bologna born puppeteer Pietro Gimonde also known as Signor Bologna This marionette was named Punchinello later evolving into Punch and finally becoming wholly British with his transformation into Mr Punch The British Punch is far more childlike and violent than Pulcinella but is renowned for being just as funny Always seen with cudgel in hand Punch has a more menacing character than his Italian counterpart In many performances he murders his wife and child as well as the Devil In Henry Mayhew wrote of one performer who described the character's enduring appeal Like the rest of the world he has got bad morals but very few of them
In Germany this kind of Pulcinella based puppet character came to be known as Kasper Kasper is a cunning servant who solves the problems of all the masters he serves This character became wildly popular throughout Europe He was less extreme than Mr Punch but offered the same kind of slapstick puppetry that audiences loved In the Netherlands he is known as Jan Klaassen In Denmark he is Mester Jakel In Romania he is Vasilache In Hungary he is Paprika Jancsi or Paprikajancsi and in the th century Vitéz László and in France he remained Polichinelle
Russian composer Igor Stravinsky was commissioned to compose two different ballets for the Ballets Russes that were inspired by variations of this character Stravinsky's ballets were entitled Petrushka based on Russian th century puppetry traditions celebrated at Shrovetide and Pulcinella based on th century Italian music thought to be by Pergolesi associated with a commedia dell'arte version

Open secret In various European languages including Italian French Spanish Polish Russian and Portuguese a Pulcinella's secret or a Polichinelo's secret is an open secret The Italian psychoanalyst and philosopher Emilio Mordini has discussed Pulcinella secrets saying that they help people to retain their sanity in contexts where secrets are impossible for example in small villages or in today's online world Mordini argues that Pulcinella secrets are not really secret in the sense that they are unknown or unknowable but because they are labeled as secret Media related to Pulcinella at Wikimedia Commons
