Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of technologies such as solar power to generate electricity solar thermal energy including solar water heating and solar architecture
It is an essential source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air
The large magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly appealing source of electricity Solar energy has been cheaper than fossil fuels since
In the International Energy Agency said that the development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer term benefits It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly import independent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating global warming These advantages are global
The Earth receives petawatts PW of incoming solar radiation insolation at the upper atmosphere Approximately is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds oceans and land masses The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near infrared ranges with a small part in the near ultraviolet Most of the world's population live in areas with insolation levels of watts m or kWh m per day
Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface oceans which cover about of the globe and atmosphere Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises causing atmospheric circulation or convection When the air reaches a high altitude where the temperature is low water vapor condenses into clouds which rain onto the Earth's surface completing the water cycle The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind cyclones and anticyclones Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of C By photosynthesis green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy which produces food wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived
The total solar energy absorbed by Earth's atmosphere oceans and land masses is approximately exajoules EJ per year In this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year Photosynthesis captures approximately EJ per year in biomass
The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography time variation cloud cover and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire In Carbon Tracker Initiative estimated the land area needed to generate all our energy from solar alone was km or about the same as the area of Sweden or the area of Morocco or the area of California of the Earth's total land area
Geography affects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the equator have a higher amount of solar radiation However the use of photovoltaics that can follow the position of the Sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the Earth for solar panels to absorb This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the Sun and reduce the light available for solar cells
Besides land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels Roofs are a suitable place for solar cells as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established
Solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world mostly depending on the distance from the equator Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends all renewable energies other than Geothermal power and Tidal power derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun
Active solar techniques use photovoltaics concentrated solar power solar thermal collectors pumps and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties designing spaces that naturally circulate air and referencing the position of a building to the Sun Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies
In the United Nations Development Programme UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs and World Energy Council published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation cloud cover and the land that is usable by humans The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of to exajoules to kWh per year see table below
Solar thermal technologies can be used for water heating space heating space cooling and process heat generation
In at the Universal Exposition in Paris Augustin Mouchot successfully demonstrated a solar steam engine but couldn't continue development because of cheap coal and other factors
In Frank Shuman a US inventor engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether which has a lower boiling point than water and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine In Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants He along with his technical advisor A S E Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether Shuman then constructed a full scale steam engine powered by low pressure water enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by
Shuman built the world's first solar thermal power station in Maadi Egypt between and His plant used parabolic troughs to power a kilowatts hp engine that pumped more than litres imp gal US gal of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the s discouraged the advancement of solar energy Shuman's vision and basic design were resurrected in the s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy In Shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy's utilization saying
Solar hot water systems use sunlight to heat water In middle geographical latitudes between degrees north and degrees south to of the domestic hot water use with water temperatures up to C F can be provided by solar heating systems The most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors and glazed flat plate collectors generally used for domestic hot water and unglazed plastic collectors used mainly to heat swimming pools
As of the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems was approximately thermal gigawatt GWth and China is the world leader in their deployment with GWth installed taken up of the market Israel and Cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over of homes using them In the United States Canada and Australia heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar hot water with an installed capacity of GWth as of
In the United States heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC systems account for EJ yr of the energy used in commercial buildings and nearly EJ yr of the energy used in residential buildings Solar heating cooling and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy Use of solar for heating can roughly be divided into passive solar concepts and active solar concepts depending on whether active elements such as sun tracking and solar concentrator optics are used
Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy Common thermal mass materials include stone cement and water Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night However they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate daylighting and shading conditions When duly incorporated thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment
A solar chimney or thermal chimney in this context is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building As the chimney warms the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials in a way that mimics greenhouses
Deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere their leaves provide shade during the summer while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter Since bare leafless trees shade to of incident solar radiation there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating In climates with significant heating loads deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability They can however be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain
Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking drying and pasteurization They can be grouped into three broad categories box cookers panel cookers and reflector cookers The simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by Horace de Saussure in A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of C F Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries dish trough Fresnel mirrors to focus light on a cooking container These cookers reach temperatures of C F and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun
Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project STEP in Shenandoah Georgia US where a field of parabolic dishes provided of the process heating air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory This grid connected cogeneration system provided kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of kW steam and kW chilled water and had a one hour peak load thermal storage Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from seawater is one of the oldest applications of solar energy Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams
Clothes lines clotheshorses and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas In some states of the United States legislation protects the right to dry clothes Unglazed transpired collectors UTC are perforated sun facing walls used for preheating ventilation air UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to C F and deliver outlet temperatures of C F The short payback period of transpired collectors to years makes them a more cost effective alternative than glazed collection systems As of over systems with a combined collector area of square metres sq ft had been installed worldwide including an m sq ft collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a m sq ft collector in Coimbatore India used for drying marigolds
Solar distillation can be used to make saline or brackish water potable The first recorded instance of this was by th century Arab alchemists A large scale solar distillation project was first constructed in in the Chilean mining town of Las Salinas The plant which had solar collection area of m sq ft could produce up to L imp gal US gal per day and operate for years Individual still designs include single slope double slope or greenhouse type vertical conical inverted absorber multi wick and multiple effect These stills can operate in passive active or hybrid modes Double slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large scale applications
Solar water disinfection SODIS involves exposing water filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate PET bottles to sunlight for several hours Exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water
Solar energy may be used in a water stabilization pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity A further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds and consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable
Molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from to The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity versus converting heat directly into electricity The molten salt mixtures vary The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate It is non flammable and non toxic and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat transport fluid Hence experience with such systems exists in non solar applications
The salt melts at C F It is kept liquid at C F in an insulated cold storage tank The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused irradiance heats it to C F It is then sent to a hot storage tank This is so well insulated that the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week
When electricity is needed the hot salt is pumped to a conventional steam generator to produce superheated steam for a turbine generator as used in any conventional coal oil or nuclear power plant A megawatt turbine would need a tank about metres ft tall and metres ft in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design
Several parabolic trough power plants in Spain and solar power tower developer SolarReserve use this thermal energy storage concept The Solana Generating Station in the U S has six hours of storage by molten salt The Mar a Elena plant is a MW thermo solar complex in the northern Chilean region of Antofagasta employing molten salt technology
Concentrating Solar Power CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant A wide range of concentrating technologies exists the most developed are the parabolic trough the solar tower collectors the concentrating linear Fresnel reflector and the Stirling dish Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight and is then used for power generation or energy storage Designs need to account for the risk of a dust storm hail or another extreme weather event that can damage the fine glass surfaces of solar power plants Metal grills would allow a high percentage of sunlight to enter the mirrors and solar panels while also preventing most damage
Sunlight has influenced building design since the beginning of architectural history Advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the Greeks and Chinese who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth
The common features of passive solar architecture are orientation relative to the Sun compact proportion a low surface area to volume ratio selective shading overhangs and thermal mass When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range Socrates' Megaron House is a classic example of passive solar design The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package Active solar equipment such as pumps fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance
Urban heat islands UHI are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment The higher temperatures result from increased absorption of solar energy by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white and to plant trees in the area Using these methods a hypothetical cool communities program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately C at an estimated cost of US billion giving estimated total annual benefits of US million from reduced air conditioning costs and healthcare savings
Agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy to optimize the productivity of plants Techniques such as timed planting cycles tailored row orientation staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south but over time sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight In Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water drying crops brooding chicks and drying chicken manure More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses
Greenhouses convert solar light to heat enabling year round production and the growth in enclosed environments of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year round for the Roman emperor Tiberius The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad Greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today Plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers

A solar balloon is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air As sunlight shines on the balloon the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force much like an artificially heated hot air balloon Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface area to payload weight ratio is relatively high
Solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or photochemical A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon based fuels such as methanol from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons though use of water as the source of electrons as plants do requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by the splitting of seawater providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel cell electric power plants and the pure water by product going directly into the municipal water system
Hydrogen production technologies have been a significant area of solar chemical research since the s Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells several thermochemical processes have also been explored One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures C or F Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production The Solzinc process under development at the Weizmann Institute of Science uses a MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide ZnO at temperatures above C F This initial reaction produces pure zinc which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen
Thermal mass systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily or interseasonal durations Thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high specific heat capacities such as water earth and stone Well designed systems can lower peak demand shift time of use to off peak hours and reduce overall heating and cooling requirements
Phase change materials such as paraffin wax and Glauber's salt are another thermal storage medium These materials are inexpensive readily available and can deliver domestically useful temperatures approximately C or F The Dover House in Dover Massachusetts was the first to use a Glauber's salt heating system in Solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using molten salts Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low cost have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems The Solar Two project used this method of energy storage allowing it to store terajoules kWh in its m storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about
Off grid PV systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity With grid tied systems excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls Net metering programs give household systems credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes If the net electricity use is below zero the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month Other approaches involve the use of two meters to measure electricity consumed vs electricity produced This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions making a second meter unnecessary
Pumped storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator
Beginning with the surge in coal use which accompanied the Industrial Revolution energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels The early development of solar technologies starting in the s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce However development of solar technologies stagnated in the early th century in the face of the increasing availability economy and utility of coal and petroleum
The oil embargo and energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world It brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the US SERI now NREL Japan NEDO and Germany Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE
Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the s These systems saw increasing use until the s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels As with photovoltaics solar water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the s but interest subsided in the s due to falling petroleum prices Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the s and annual growth rates have averaged since Although generally underestimated solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of GW as of

Floating solar arrays are PV systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs quarry lakes irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds A small number of such systems exist in France India Japan South Korea the United Kingdom Singapore and the United States The systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land The cost of land is more expensive and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation Unlike most land based solar plants floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view They achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on land because water cools the panels The panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion In May the Far Niente Winery in Oakville California pioneered the world's first floatovoltaic system by installing solar PV modules with a total capacity of kW onto pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond Utility scale floating PV farms are starting to be built Kyocera will develop the world's largest a MW farm on the reservoir above Yamakura Dam in Chiba Prefecture using solar panels Salt water resistant floating farms are also being constructed for ocean use The largest so far announced floatovoltaic project is a MW power station in the Amazon region of Brazil
A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a heat sink Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one A solar assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system Typically these two technologies are used separately or only placing them in parallel to produce hot water In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator The goal of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way
It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel sheet and tubes roll bond heat pipe thermal plates or hybrid mono polycrystalline thin film in combination with the heat pump The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows covering a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduces the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system
