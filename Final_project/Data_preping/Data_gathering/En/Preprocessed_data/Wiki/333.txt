giovanni gentile italian d o vanni d en ti le may april was an italian neo hegelian idealist philosopher educator and fascist politician
the self styled philosopher of fascism he was influential in providing an intellectual foundation for italian fascism and ghostwrote part of the doctrine of fascism with benito mussolini
he was involved in the resurgence of hegelian idealism in italian philosophy and also devised his own system of thought which he called actual idealism or actualism which has been described as the subjective extreme of the idealist tradition
giovanni gentile was born in castelvetrano italy
he was inspired by risorgimento era italian intellectuals such as mazzini rosmini gioberti and spaventa from whom he borrowed the idea of autoctisi self construction but also strongly influenced and mentored by the german idealist and materialist schools of thought namely karl marx hegel and fichte with whom he shared the ideal of creating a wissenschaftslehre epistemology a theory for a structure of knowledge that makes no assumptions
friedrich nietzsche too influenced him as seen in an analogy between nietzsche s bermensch and gentile s uomo fascista
in religion he presented himself as a catholic of sorts and emphasised actual idealism s christian heritage antonio g
pesce insists that there is in fact no doubt that gentile was a catholic but he occasionally identified himself as an atheist albeit one who was still culturally a catholic
he won a fierce competition to become one of four exceptional students of the prestigious scuola normale superiore di pisa where he enrolled in the faculty of humanities
in he graduated in letters and philosophy with a dissertation titled rosmini e gioberti that he realized
under the supervision of donato jaja a disciple of bertrando spaventa
during his academic career gentile served in a number of positions including as
professor of the history of philosophy at the university of palermo march
professor of theoretical philosophy at the university of pisa august
professor of the history of philosophy at the university of rome november and later as professor of theoretical philosophy
commissioner of the scuola normale superiore di pisa and later as its director and
vice president of bocconi university in milan in gentile was named minister of public education for the government of benito mussolini
in this capacity he instituted the riforma gentile a reformation of the secondary school system that had a long lasting impact on italian education
his philosophical works included the theory of mind as pure act and logic as theory of knowledge with which he defined actual idealism a unified metaphysical system reinforcing his sentiments that philosophy isolated from life and life isolated from philosophy are but two identical modes of backward cultural bankruptcy
for gentile this theory indicated how philosophy could directly influence mould and penetrate life or how philosophy could govern life
in gentile headed two constitutional reform commissions that helped establish the corporate state of fascism
he would go on to serve as president of the fascist state s grand council of public education and even gained membership on the powerful fascist grand council
gentile s philosophical system the foundation of all fascist philosophy viewed thought as all embracing no one could actually leave his or her sphere of thought nor exceed his or her thought
reality was unthinkable except in relation to the activity by means of which it becomes thinkable positing that as a unity held in the active subject and the discrete abstract phenomena that reality comprehends wherein each phenomenon when truly realised was centered within that unity therefore it was innately spiritual transcendent and immanent to all possible things in contact with the unity
gentile used that philosophic frame to systematize every item of interest that now was subject to the rule of absolute self identification thus rendering as correct every consequence of the hypothesis
the resultant philosophy can be interpreted as an idealist foundation for legal naturalism
giovanni gentile was described by mussolini and by himself as the philosopher of fascism moreover he was the ghostwriter of the first part of the essay the doctrine of fascism attributed to mussolini
it was first published in in the italian encyclopedia wherein he described the traits characteristic of italian fascism at the time compulsory state corporatism philosopher kings the abolition of the parliamentary system and autarky
he also wrote the manifesto of the fascist intellectuals which was signed by a number of writers and intellectuals including luigi pirandello gabriele d annunzio filippo tommaso marinetti and giuseppe ungaretti
gentile became a member of the fascist grand council in and remained loyal to mussolini even after the fall of the fascist government in
he supported mussolini s establishment of the republic of sal a puppet state of nazi germany despite having criticized its anti jewish laws and accepted an appointment in its government
gentile was the last president of the royal academy of italy
in a group of communist patriotic action groups gap partisans led by bruno fanciullacci assassinated gentile as he returned from the prefecture in florence
gentile was buried in the church of santa croce in florence
benedetto croce wrote that gentile
holds the honor of having been the most rigorous neo hegelian in the entire history of western philosophy and the dishonor of having been the official philosopher of fascism in italy his philosophical basis for fascism was rooted in his understanding of ontology and epistemology in which he found vindication for the rejection of individualism and acceptance of collectivism with the state as the ultimate location of authority and loyalty outside of which individuality had no meaning and which in turn helped justify the totalitarian dimension of fascism
the conceptual relationship between gentile s actual idealism and his conception of fascism is not self evident
the supposed relationship does not appear to be based on logical deducibility
that is actual idealism does not entail a fascist ideology in any rigorous sense
gentile enjoyed fruitful intellectual relations with croce from and particularly during their joint editorship of la critica from to but broke philosophically and politically from croce in the early s over gentile s embrace of fascism
croce assesses their philosophical disagreement in una discussione tra filosofi amici in conversazioni critiche ii
ultimately gentile foresaw a social order wherein opposites of all kinds weren t to be considered as existing independently from each other that publicness and privateness as broad interpretations were currently false as imposed by all former kinds of government including capitalism and communism and that only the reciprocal totalitarian state of corporatism a fascist state could defeat these problems which are made from reifying as an external reality that which is in fact to gentile only a reality in thinking
whereas it was common in the philosophy of the time to see the conditional subject as abstract and the object as concrete gentile postulated after hegel the opposite that the subject is concrete and the object a mere abstraction or rather that what was conventionally dubbed subject is in fact only conditional object and that the true subject is the act of being or essence of the object
gentile was because of his actualist system a notable philosophical presence across europe during his time
at its base gentile s brand of idealism asserted the primacy of the pure act of thinking
this act is foundational to all human experience it creates the phenomenal world and involves a process of reflective awareness in italian l atto del pensiero pensiero pensante that is constitutive of the absolute and revealed in education
gentile s emphasis on seeing mind as the absolute signaled his revival of the idealist doctrine of the autonomy of the mind it also connected his philosophical work to his vocation as a teacher
in actual idealism then pedagogy is transcendental and provides the process by which the absolute is revealed
his idea of a transcending truth above positivism garnered particular attention by emphasizing that all modes of sensation only take the form of ideas within one s mind in other words they are mental constructs
to gentile for example even the correlation of the function and location of the physical brain with the functions of the physical body was merely a consistent creation of the mind and not of the brain itself a creation of the mind
observations like this have led some commentators to view gentile s philosophy as a kind of absolute solipsism expressing the idea that only the spirit or mind is real
actual idealism also touches on ideas of concern to theology
an example of actual idealism in theology is the idea that although man may have invented the concept of god it does not make god any less real in any possible sense so long as god is not presupposed to exist as abstraction and except in case qualities about what existence actually entails i e
being invented apart from the thinking that makes it are presupposed
benedetto croce objected that gentile s pure act is nothing other than schopenhauer s will
therefore gentile proposed a form of what he called absolute immanentism in which the divine was the present conception of reality in the totality of one s individual thinking as an evolving growing and dynamic process
many times accused of solipsism gentile maintained his philosophy to be a humanism that sensed the possibility of nothing beyond what was colligate in perception the self s human thinking in order to communicate as immanence is to be human like oneself made a cohesive empathy of the self same without an external division and therefore not modeled as objects to one s own thinking
whereas solipsism would feel trapped in realization of its solitude actualism rejects such a privation and is an expression of the only freedom which is possible within objective contingencies where the transcendental self does not even exist as an object and the dialectical co substantiation of others necessary to understand the empirical self are felt as true others when found to be the unrelativistic subjectivity of that whole self and essentially unified with the spirit of such higher self in actu where others can be truly known rather than thought as windowless monads
a number of developments in gentile s thought and career helped to define his philosophy including
the definition of actual idealism in his work theory of the pure act
his support for the invasion of libya and the entry of italy into world war i
his dispute with benedetto croce over the historic inevitability of fascism
his role as minister of education
his belief that fascism could be made subservient to his philosophical thought along with his gathering of influence through the work of students like armando carlini leader of the so called right gentilians and ugo spirito who applied gentile s philosophy to social problems and helped codify fascist political theory and
his work on the enciclopedia italiana first edition finished in gentile considered fascism the fulfillment of the risorgimento ideals particularly those represented by giuseppe mazzini and the historical right party
gentile sought to make his philosophy the basis for fascism
however with gentile and with fascism the problem of the party existed by virtue of the fact that the fascist party as such arose organically rather than from a tract or pre established socio political doctrine
this complicated the matter for gentile as it left no consensus to any way of thinking among fascists but ironically this aspect was to gentile s view of how a state or party doctrine should live out its existence with natural organic growth and dialectical opposition intact
the fact that mussolini gave credence to gentile s view points via gentile s authorship helped with an official consideration even though the problem of the party continued to exist for mussolini as well
gentile placed himself within the hegelian tradition but also sought to distance himself from those views he considered erroneous
he criticized hegel s dialectic of idea nature spirit and instead proposed that everything is spirit with the dialectic residing in the pure act of thinking
gentile believed marx s conception of the dialectic to be the fundamental flaw of his application to system making
to the neo hegelian gentile marx had made the dialectic into an external object and therefore had abstracted it by making it part of a material process of historical development
the dialectic to gentile could only be something of human precepts something that is an active part of human thinking
it was to gentile concrete subject and not abstract object
this gentile expounded by how humans think in forms wherein one side of a dual opposite could not be thought of without its complement
upward wouldn t be known without downward and heat couldn t be known without cold while each are opposites they are co dependent for either one s realization these were creations that existed as dialectic only in human thinking and couldn t be confirmed outside of which and especially could not be said to exist in a condition external to human thought like independent matter and a world outside of personal subjectivity or as an empirical reality when not conceived in unity and from the standpoint of the human mind
to gentile marx s externalizing of the dialectic was essentially a fetishistic mysticism
though when viewed externally thus it followed that marx could then make claims to the effect of what state or condition the dialectic objectively existed in history a posteriori of where any individual s opinion was while comporting oneself to the totalized whole of society
people themselves could by such a view be ideologically backwards and left behind from the current state of the dialectic and not themselves be part of what is actively creating the dialectic as it is
gentile thought this was absurd and that there was no positive independently existing dialectical object
rather the dialectic was natural to the state as it is
meaning that the interests composing the state are composing the dialectic by their living organic process of holding oppositional views within that state and unified therein
it being the mean condition of those interests as ever they exist
even criminality is unified as a necessarily dialectic to be subsumed into the state and a creation and natural outlet of the dialectic of the positive state as ever it is
this view influenced by the hegelian theory of the state justified the corporative system where in the individualized and particular interests of all divergent groups were to be personably incorporated into the state stato etico each to be considered a bureaucratic branch of the state itself and given official leverage
gentile rather than believing the private to be swallowed synthetically within the public as marx would have it in his objective dialectic believed that public and private were a priori identified with each other in an active and subjective dialectic one could not be subsumed fully into the other as they already are beforehand the same
in such a manner each is the other after their own fashion and from their respective relative and reciprocal position
yet both constitute the state itself and neither are free from it nothing ever being truly free from it the state as in hegel existing as an eternal condition and not an objective abstract collection of atomistic values and facts of the particulars about what is positively governing the people at any given time
