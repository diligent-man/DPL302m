Jean Chardin November January born Jean Baptiste Chardin and also known as Sir John Chardin was a French jeweller and traveller whose ten volume book The Travels of Sir John Chardin is regarded as one of the finest works of early Western scholarship on Safavid Iran and the Near East in general

A learned nobleman Mirza Sefi a prisoner in his own palace at Isfahan had entertained him instructed him in the Persian language and assisted him in this work
Peter de la Croix and Tavernier severely criticised it while Ange de la Brosse as strongly defended it
Chardin again started for the East August
He was at Constantinople from March to July
A quarrel between the grand vizier and the French ambassador made the position of French subjects dangerous and Chardin escaped in a small vessel across the Black Sea and made a most adventurous journey by Caffa and through Georgia and Armenia to Isfahan which he reached in
At Sapias he was robbed by thugs in Samegrelo of all he possessed except two small bundles worth £
He stayed at Ispahan four years following the court in all its removals and making particular journeys throughout the land from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf and the river Indus and visiting several Indian cities
By these two journeys he realised a considerable fortune and deciding to return home reached Europe in by a voyage round the Cape of Good Hope

Chardin in his preface announced three other volumes to follow The last which was to contain a short history of Persia along with his diaries for never appeared The other three volumes with many additions to the first were published at Amsterdam to Voyages de Mons le Chevalier Chardin as the complete work In another edition with his translation of La Relation des Mingreliens by J M Zampi appeared in ten vols Amsterdam lmo and in another edition was published in four vols to containing a great number of passages added from his manuscripts but with many omissions of violent Calvinistic passages The most complete reprint is that of M L Langles in ten vols vo Paris
Chardin's style of writing is simple and graphic and he gives a faithful account of what he saw and heard Montesquieu Rousseau Gibbon and Helvetius acknowledge the value of his writings and Sir William Jones says he gave the best account of Muslim nations ever published
Extracts from his works appear in all the chief collections of travels but there is no complete English translation
In Chardin determined to settle in England because of the persecution of Protestants in France

On his return to London he devoted most of his time to oriental studies
In the prefaces to his works and besides travels he speaks of what he calls 'my favourite desipi' or 'Notes upon Passages of to the Holy Scriptures illustrated by Eastern ally Customs and Manners' as having occupied his time for many years
He did not live after to publish it and after his death the manuscript was supposed to be lost
Some of his descendants advertised a reward of twenty guineas for it
When Thomas Harmer published a second edition of his 'Observations on divers pissages of Scripture' vols London vo it was found that he had recovered the lost manuscript in six small volumes with the help of Sir Philip Musgrave a descendant of Chardin and had incorporated almost all of them in his work under the author's name or signed 'MS C' ie manuscript of Chardin

Modern scholars consider the edition of Voyages edited by the Orientalist Louis Mathieu Langlès to be the standard version The complete book has never been translated into English in fact English language versions contain less than half of the original material
Early readers commended Chardin's work for its fullness and fidelity and he received praise from a number of Enlightenment thinkers among them Montesquieu Rousseau Voltaire and Gibbon Latter day scholars of Persia also vouch for his importance according to John Emerson his information on Safavid Persia outranks that of all other Western writers in range depth accuracy and judiciousness Chardin travelled far and wide had a good command of the Persian language and left detailed accounts of the places and people he encountered He also had direct access to the Safavid court and his descriptions of contemporary politics and administration are highly regarded Although there are occasional lapses in his books he is generally trusted as a reliable witness and his work has been used as a source for diverse studies on Safavid history government economics anthropology religion art and culture
