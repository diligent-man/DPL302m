selma alabama during the american civil war was one of the south s main military manufacturing centers producing tons of supplies and munitions and turning out confederate warships
the selma ordnance and naval foundry complex included a naval foundry shipyard army arsenal and gunpowder works
following the battle of selma union maj
james h
wilson s troops destroyed selma s army arsenal and factories as well as much of the city
because of its central location production facilities and rail connections the advantages of selma as a site for production of cartridges saltpeter powder shot and shell rifles cannon and steam rams soon became apparent to the confederacy
by most materiel was manufactured in selma employing at least ten thousand people
selma along with the tredegar iron works in richmond was one of two sites producing the brooke rifle a rifled naval and coast defense cannon designed by john mercer brooke
the hulls for several confederate ironclads including the css huntsville css phoenix css tennessee and css tuscaloosa were laid at the confederate navy yard there
css nashville was also partially outfitted in selma
the capacities and importance of selma in its relation to the confederate war effort had been evident to northern strategists and too great to be overlooked by the federal authorities as early as
but reaching it with a federal force was not attempted early in the war as its distance from the front lines made it an extremely difficult target
as selma grew in importance to the confederate forces the greater became the necessity to capture it
brigadier general benjamin grierson with a cavalry force from memphis was intercepted and returned in
major general william tecumseh sherman made an effort to reach it in february but after advancing as far as meridian within miles km of selma he retreated to the mississippi river
general lovell rousseau made a dash in the direction of selma in but was misled by his guides and instead struck miles km east of the city
major general james h
wilson detached brig
john t
croxton s brigade to destroy all confederate property at tuscaloosa alabama
after capturing a confederate courier who carried dispatches from general nathan bedford forrest describing the strengths and dispositions of his scattered forces wilson also sent a brigade to destroy the bridge across the cahaba river at centreville
this action effectively cut off most of forrest s reinforcements
this began a running fight that did not end until after the fall of selma
on the afternoon of april after skirmishing all morning wilson s advanced guard ran into forrest s line of battle at ebenezer church where the randolph road intersected the main selma road
here forrest had hoped to bring his entire force to bear on wilson
however delays caused by flooding plus earlier contact with the enemy enabled forrest to muster less than men a large number of whom were not veterans but militia consisting of old men and young boys
the outnumbered and outgunned confederates fought bravely for more than an hour as more union cavalry and artillery deployed on the field
forrest himself was wounded by a saber wielding union captain whom he killed with his revolver
finally a union cavalry charge with carbines blazing broke the confederate militia causing forrest to be flanked on his right
he was forced to retreat under severe pressure
early the next morning forrest arrived at selma horse and rider covered in blood he advised gen
richard taylor departmental commander to leave the city
taylor did so after giving forrest command of the defense
selma was protected by three miles of fortifications which ran in a semicircle around the city
they were anchored on the north and south by the alabama river
the works had been built two years earlier and while neglected for the most part since were still formidable
they were to feet m high feet m thick at the base with a ditch feet m wide and feet m deep along the front
in front of this was a picket fence of heavy posts planted in the ground feet m high and sharpened at the top
at prominent positions earthen forts were built with artillery in position to cover the ground over which an assault would have to be made
forrest s defenders consisted of his tennessee escort company mccullough s missouri regiment crossland s kentucky brigade roddey s alabama brigade frank armstrong s mississippi brigade general daniel w
adams state reserves and the citizens of selma who were volunteered to man the works
altogether this force numbered less than only half of who were dependable
the selma fortifications were built to be defended by men
forrest s soldiers had to stand to feet m apart in the works
wilson s force arrived in front of the selma fortifications at p m
he had placed gen
eli long s division across the summerfield road with the chicago board of trade battery in support
he had maj
emory upton s division placed across the range line road with battery i th u s
artillery in support
altogether wilson had troops available for the assault
the federal commander s plan was for upton to send in a man detachment after dark to cross the swamp on the confederate right enter the works and begin a flanking movement toward the center moving along the line of fortifications
then a single gun from upton s artillery would signal the attack by the entire federal corps
at p m however gen
long s ammunition train in the rear was attacked by advance elements of forrest s scattered forces coming toward selma
both long and upton had positioned significant numbers of troops in their rear for just such an event
however long decided to commence his assault against the selma fortifications to neutralize the enemy attack in his rear
long s troops attacked in a single rank in three main lines dismounted with spencers carbines blazing supported by their own artillery fire
the confederates replied with heavy small arms and artillery fire of their own
the southern artillery in one of the many ironies of the civil war only had solid shot on hand while just a short distance away was an arsenal which produced tons of canister a highly effective anti personnel ammunition
the federals suffered many casualties including general long himself but not enough to break up the attack
once the union army reached the works there was vicious hand to hand fighting
many soldiers were struck down with clubbed muskets
but in less than minutes long s men had captured the works protecting the summerfield road
meanwhile general upton observing long s success ordered his division forward
the story was much the same for his men as on long s front
soon u s
flags could be seen waving over the works from range line road to summerfield road
after the outer works fell general wilson himself led the th u s
cavalry regiment in a mounted charge down the range line road toward the unfinished inner line of works
the retreating confederate forces upon reaching the inner works all rallied and poured a devastating fire into the charging column
this broke up the charge and sent general wilson sprawling to the ground when his favorite horse was wounded
he quickly remounted his stricken mount and ordered a dismounted assault by several regiments
mixed units of confederate troops had also occupied the selma railroad depot and the adjoining banks of the railroad bed to make a stand next to the plantersville road present day broad street
the fighting there was heavy but by p m the superior numbers of union troops had managed to flank the southern positions causing them to abandon the depot as well as the inner line of works
in the darkness the union rounded up hundreds of prisoners but hundreds more escaped down the burnsville road including generals forrest armstrong and roddey
to the west many confederate soldiers fought the pursuing union soldiers all the way down to the eastern side of valley creek
they escaped in the darkness by swimming across the alabama river near the mouth of valley creek where the present day battle of selma reenactment is held
the union soldiers looted the city that night while many businesses and private residences were burned
they spent the next week destroying the arsenal and naval foundry
then they left selma heading to montgomery
