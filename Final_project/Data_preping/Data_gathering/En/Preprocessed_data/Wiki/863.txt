gatekeeping is the process through which information is filtered for dissemination whether for publication broadcasting the internet or some other mode of communication
the academic theory of gatekeeping may be found in multiple fields of study including communication studies journalism political science and sociology
gatekeeping originally focused on the mass media with its few to many dynamic
currently the gatekeeping theory also addresses face to face communication and the many to many dynamic inherent on the internet
social psychologist kurt lewin first instituted gatekeeping theory in
gatekeeping occurs at all levels of the media structure from a reporter deciding which sources are presented in a headline story to editors choosing which stories are printed or covered
including but not limited to media outlet owners and advertisers
gatekeeping is a process by which information is filtered to the public by the media
according to pamela shoemaker and tim vos gatekeeping is the process of culling and crafting countless bits of information into the limited number of messages that reach people every day and it is the center of the media s role in modern public life
this process determines not only which information is selected but also what the content and nature of the messages such as news will be
in exercising its surveillance function every news medium has a very large number of stories brought to its attention daily by reporters wire services and a variety of other sources
due to a number of practical considerations only a limited amount of time or space is available in any medium for its daily presentations of the news to its audience
the remaining space must be devoted to advertising and other content
within any news organization there exists a news perspective a subculture that includes a complex set of criteria for judging a particular news story criteria based on economic needs of the medium organizational policy definitions of newsworthiness conceptions of the nature of relevant audience and beliefs about fourth estate obligations of journalists
this news perspective and its complex criteria are used by editors news directors and other personnel who select a limited number of news stories for presentation to the public
they then encode them in ways such that the requirements of the medium and the tastes of the audience are met
therefore personnel in the news organization become gatekeepers letting some stories pass through the system but keeping others out
this then limits controls and shapes the public s knowledge of the totality of actual event occurring in reality gatekeeping as a news process was identified in the literature as early as though not yet given a formal theoretical name
in his book the immigrant press park explains the process out of all of the events that happen and are recorded every day by correspondents reporters and the news agencies the editor chooses certain items for publication which he regards as more important or more interesting than others
the remainder he condemns to oblivion and the wastebasket
there is an enormous amount of news killed every day p
formally gatekeeping was identified in kurt lewin s publication forces behind food habits and methods of change
working during world war ii lewin conducted field research initially among midwestern housewives to determine how to effectively change their families food consumption during this time of war
lewin recognized that for food to go from a store or a garden to the dining table there were various decision making processes it had to pass on the way there
at a time when men were thought to control all household decisions lewin found that food does not move by its own impetus
entering or not entering a channel and moving from one section of a channel to another is affected by a gatekeeper p
the gatekeeper in this case was typically the housewife or sometimes a maid in more affluent households
lewin s research demonstrated that not all members of a family have equal weight in making household food decisions and that the wife who typically shops for and prepares the food controls the gates based on a variety of considerations
lewin s study published in became the impetus for another article in in which he introduces the idea of feedback in group decision making which complicates the role of the gatekeeper
feedback acknowledges that the set of considerations a gatekeeper uses in making decisions may vary depending on considerations of the group
in david manning white a journalism professor at boston university looked at the factors an editor takes into consideration when deciding which news will make the paper and which news will not intending to examine how a gate keeper examines his gate within a channel of mass communication
white contacted an editor a man in his mid s with years of experience whom he calls mr
gates mr
gates was the wire editor of a morning newspaper in a mid west city of that had a circulation of
during the case study mr
gates retained all copy that he rejected from the paper for a week
at the end of his shift he made notes on why that story was rejected assuming he could still remember the reason
at the end of the week that the study took place white found that nine tenths of the wire copy got rejected and the process is made by highly subjective decisions based on the editor s own set of experiences attitudes and expectations
white found that in this particular study the majority of the rejections could be classified in two ways not worthy of being reported or there was another story on the same event
pertaining to the first reason many of the explanations mr
gates gives for rejection are highly subjective value judgments examples of this are seen when mr
gates writes too red or don t care for suicides
pertaining to the second reason of rejection given for the majority of the rejections mr
gates made no personal rejections to the copy but there was simply no space available for it in the paper
the later the story came to mr
gates the less of a chance it had to take up any valuable space remaining
white examined mr
gates performance for a specific day and put the data in tables which show the amount and type of news which appeared on the front pages and the total number of dispatches used
gates admitted to preferring political news to other types of news and explained that he tries to avoid sensationalism and consistently leans more towards being conservative both in political views and in writing style
observed patterns throughout the week also show that mr
gates leans away from stories filled with figures and statistics and prefers stories that contain more of a narrative
his notes and reasons for rejection can also show mr
gates writing standard using too vague not interesting and dull writing on a number of occasions
a question that white poses and says should be considered in this case study is does the category really enter into the choice
he concludes that as mr
gates is representing gate keepers and wire editors as a whole there doesn t seem to be a particular choice of news by categories
during the week the case study took place however there was a strong emphasis on human interest stories because there was a large appeal to a story regarding a cardinal of the catholic church
gates also concludes that the gate keeper s standards and taste should refer back to the audience and that they are the ones being served and pleased
his concluding remarks provide a great summary of the purpose and findings of the study
through studying his overt reasons for rejecting news stories from the press associations we see how highly subjective how based on the gate keeper s own set of experiences attitudes and expectations the communication of news really is
more than fifty years after white s mr
gates study in pamela shoemaker martin eichholz eunyi kim and brenda wrigley studied the forces in news gatekeeping in relation to coverage of congressional bills
more specifically they were interested in two hypotheses the routine gatekeeping force of assessing a bill s newsworthiness will be related to how prominently a bill is covered and the individual journalistic forces education political ideology work experience ethnicity gender voting behavior will be related to how prominently a bill is covered
they also predicted that the newsworthiness of a bill would be more important than journalists personal characteristics
surveying both journalists for their personal characteristics and editors for evaluating newsworthiness shoemaker and her colleagues found that only newsworthiness had a significant effect on the amount of coverage given to a bill thus their first hypothesis was supported as well as the idea that newsworthiness would be more important than personal characteristics
while shoemaker et al s study focused on traditional news rooms singer has been interested in how gatekeeping translates to how traditional newspapers use online tools
in both the and presidential elections she studied how the internet was changing the process for newspapers contending that the power of gatekeepers seems to diminish in a modern information society
the internet defies the whole notion of a gate and challenges the idea that journalists or anyone else can or should limit what passes through it p
in the study of the coverage singer posed the following research questions what did editors of web sites affiliated with major newspapers see as their goals and their most noteworthy achievements in covering the political campaign and election to what extent did these editors relinquish their gatekeeping role by providing opportunities for users to provide or personalize content and more broadly in what ways have the views of editors of web sites affiliated with major newspapers changed since
singer found that the content which appears in online editions of newspapers mostly comes from content that appears in the print versions
however editors were also very proud of the interactive tools on their websites that could not be in the paper
the goal of most editors was after all to inform the public
further journalists were beginning to take a step back from their traditional gatekeeping role such that many websites had sections in which journalists provided baseline information and users could manipulate according to their needs and interests like interactive maps electoral college scenarios and ballot building tools based on zip codes
in editors were likely to boast about how quickly they could publish returns on election night
in this was no longer the case as it was standard practice by then
further their stated goal for the election cycle was to let the audience guide the coverage
karine barzilai nahon has written a number of contemporary pieces on gatekeeping theories between disciplines
in she proposed a new way of looking at gatekeeping merging the disciplines of communication information science and management perspectives into a refined theory of gatekeeping
traditional mass communication gatekeeping theory has focused on how we get news however barzilai nahon s approach applies to all information
barzilai nahon also adds new terms and redefines old terms in the framework pp
gate entrance to or exit from a network or its sections
gatekeeping the process of controlling information as it moves through a gate
activities include among others selection addition withholding display channeling shaping manipulation repetition timing localization integration disregard and deletion of information
gated the entity subjected to gatekeeping
gatekeeping mechanism a tool technology or methodology used to carry out the process of gatekeeping
network gatekeeper an entity people organizations or governments that has the discretion to exercise gatekeeping through a gatekeeping mechanism in networks and can choose the extent to which to exercise it contingent upon the gated standing this updated look at gatekeeping also poses a number of classifications including the bases for gatekeeping mechanisms used in network gatekeeping and types of authority of network gatekeepers
additionally barzilai nahon introduces a typology for the gated
according to her approach the gated can have four key attributes at different levels that determine how they can interact with the gate
these are p
political power in relation to the gatekeeper
information production ability
relationship with the gatekeeper
and alternatives in the context of gatekeeping a typology of combinations of these characteristics then allows for evaluation of potential interactions between the gatekeeper and the gated based on the number and type of attributes an individual has
her discussion about the gated resonates with audience gatekeeping in that both empowers the message recipients in the process of gatekeeping
the process of gatekeeping has extended from the traditional act of deciding what news is the best news but information in general
according to marcelo thomas there are actors called intermediaries that are involved with the architecture of information we come in contact with
they are making decisions about the structure as well as the content of our information
these decisions make these intermediaries technological gatekeepers
this provision of information for an organization s member as well as those outside that organization is less about agenda setting media outcomes but a practical approach to usability
an example of this role would be a content manager for a company s knowledge database
all of the articles and reference materials are curated and updated by these managers
while they may work in teams with oversight the fact remains that decision are made about the content that will exist on the site and how it is displayed
along with web environment users have begun playing a greater role in producing and re distributing online news items via online social networks such as twitter and facebook
shoemaker and vos theorized such practice as audience gatekeeping
according to them audience gatekeeping is the process in which users pass along already available news items and comment on them based on the user s own set of criteria about the newsworthiness p
kwon et al
adapted the theory of audience gatekeeping to explore what channels are mainly adopted for twitter audiences to filter and share news contents
the notion of audience gatekeeping consists with goode s discussion on metajournalism whereby users role in reprocessing and rebroadcasting the existing online contents are as equally emphasized as users original creation in nurturing citizen journalism as reshaping the existing hierarchy of the journalism system
kwon et al
also found that re processed news items by user generated content websites or social media are more frequently adopted by twitter users than the direct news times from traditional mass media organizations confirming the empowering role of ordinary online users in retelling and redistributing news agendas to networked publics
the next step after the user deciding to share news with its network would be way finding
pearson and kosciki describe this as a journey or guided tour from a user s arrival on the web to their site and to the information that user is looking for
the metaphor is borrowed from architects and planners
they design systems for users to navigate from place to place
along with directional cues education and even delight are designed in to the plans
this is not dissimilar to what media planners are doing today
the user arrives online in a crowded city of information as they type onto a search engine they begin to navigate the online space
from a purely gatekeeping perspective information and news was the destination users went directly to the place they expected to find what they were looking for today a user inputs what they want to learn about the various sources are in competition for the user s attention using marketing techniques the source will hopefully grab the attention of the user and then lead them to the content they re searching for
it has been established that journalists are attempting to meet the needs of their audience
they identify news and then report it
it s this identification process that we find traditional gatekeeping
in the discussion of media gatekeeping is a debate between traditional journalism the blogging community
political bloggers have increased their audience as well as their scope of activities and ambition
schiffer considers it an alternative form of journalism that can possess traditional journalism s sought after qualities while omitting some of its drawbacks
the main criticism of traditional journalism is the lack of control by the user over the content they are presented with
blogging utilizes the community to perform a type of collective editing
as consumers interact with the blog and each other on its behalf the popular grows calling more consumers into the fold
while this will certainly allow the user to decide for itself what news needs to be out front the blogging has its limitations as well
because anyone can blog and can do so without editing from above with professional standards from the trade craft filtering the information down to its most essential components is often overlooked
differences between traditional journalists and bloggers aside the main similarity is that both parties have to decide what is news worthy and then report it
schiffer also found that user created content creators utilize a type of gate keeping as it concerns the comments on their publications
some bloggers require approval by a moderator before comments can be added to a post
at times comments are disabled altogether
this means that bloggers are not only gatekeeping the content they output but the on page discussion around that submission
larger media organization with an online presence have the same capability as it is associated with the technology and not the host
a rise in social media popularity has sparked reliance on media outlets to produce newsworthy content
as newspaper distribution rates drop news outlets rely heavily on social media editors to promote news items
kasper welbers and micha l opgenhaffen take a deeper look at social media gatekeeping through an analysis of news outlets influence on public social media
as news outlets transition into the digital age journalists and specialized social media experts have adapted to fill holes in traditional news distribution
what makes social media so formidable lies in the diffusion process of user engagement primarily seen through likes shares comments and reposts
ease of access when sharing news links through social media plug ins on websites and apps furthers the widespread availability of new distributions causing an increasingly complex relationships between news production and consumption pp
welbers and opgenhaffen build off of gatekeeping theory by defining two new channels that correlate to the influence news outlets have over the media
the social media editor channel barzilai nahon shoemaker and vos refers to the origin of news information on social media referring to its original publication by specialized social media news experts
likewise the alternative channel refers to all other ways news items enter public mainstream circulation
measurement of these channels dictates how news items enter social media through either newspapers or news outlets
lewin s first task to uncovering gatekeepers is finding out who the original gatekeepers are
in this case social media editors can be coined as influential gatekeepers
origins of gatekeepers clash as either channel becomes blurred by intersections between social media editors and individual users thus making it difficult to determine the definition of gatekeeping throughout social media
the term gatewatching coined by axel bruns refers to gatekeeping as a concept in the digital era vos
bruns argued that gatekeeping did not accurately describe the process in which news currently flows between participants and public circulation
influencers and individuals who share news do not keep gates of their own but instead share news and media to their respected social followers
journalists rely on the five criteria when choosing a news story
the first criterion is strong impact
local stories impact the public more than unfamiliar international events
in order to attract attention journalists inflate news and present them as situations that could happen to anyone
they turn rare international crises into everyday scenarios personalizing stories and losing the main significance of them violence conflict disaster or scandal is the second criterion
topics such as murders wars shootings or hurricanes captivate the attention of the audience
newspapers containing violence outsold other newspaper chains that contained less violence the third criterion is familiarity
news stories gain more attention if they have issues pertaining to the public or if they include familiar situations concerning a large audience
journalists try to turn international events or crises into stories that can relate back to their current audience
people tend to retain a lot of information about celebrities and tend to care about the personal intimacy of other s lives
they value the traits and attributes of others and may try to relate to them in many ways
news about a celebrity s or president s death may resonate on a deeper level allowing certain events to remain in the memory much longer proximity is the fourth element
people prefer news that is local close in proximity
people pay close attention to local news more than they do to international or national affairs
local media outlets do well because they focus most of their stories on local events about seventy five percent
there is a strong preference for local news over international and national news the fifth element is timeliness and novelty
news should be something interesting that does not occur every day or an event that is not a part of people s lives
events such as hurricanes or new store openings capture the attention of many the news criteria pressure journalists and news outlets to frequently publish new stories in order to stay current on events
reporters attend local events in order to get stories quickly and easily
when events are difficult to report on journalists resort to interviews or experts of the event or field
the five criteria dictate which events are chosen and which events to spend money on to report
the size of a newspaper also dictates which stories to publish and which ones to skip
once stories reach news outlets editors must determine which stories to select
editors do not spend much time choosing stories
an average editor must choose stories in seconds
investigative or complex stories are covered by tv sources and radio
those types of stories go towards television and radio because they have more time to dedicate to the stories
they can describe the event background and causes in depth
the size of the paper and the pressure editors have may cause bias in the audience s perspective
stories containing the five criterion almost always make the front page of the news
the frequent representation of those types of stories often leads to skewness from the public
