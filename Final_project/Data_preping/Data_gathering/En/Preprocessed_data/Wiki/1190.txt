Surbiton is a suburban neighbourhood in South West London, within the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames (RBK)
It is next to the River Thames, 11 miles (18 km) southwest of Charing Cross
Surbiton was in the historic county of Surrey and since 1965 it has been in Greater London
Surbiton comprises four of the RBK's wards: Alexandra, Berrylands, St
Mark's, and Surbiton Hill.
Founded originally as Kingston-upon-Railway when the area was first developed in the 1840s, Surbiton possesses a mixture of grand 19th-century townhouses, Art Deco courts, and more recent residential blocks blending in with semi-detached 20th-century housing estates
With a population of 45,132 in 2016, it accounts for approximately 25% of the total population of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames
Surbiton extends over an area of 7.18 km (2.77 sq mi).
Though Surbiton only received its current name in 1869, the name is attested as Suberton in 1179, Surbeton in 1263, Surpeton in 1486, and finally Surbiton 1597
Sūth Bere-tūn means "southern grange" or "outlying farm" in Old English, as opposed to nearby Norbiton; both Norbiton and Surbiton were possessions of the royal manor of Kingston.
The present-day town came into existence after a plan to build a London-Southampton railway line through nearby Kingston was rejected by Kingston Council, who feared that it would be detrimental to the coaching trade
This resulted in the line being routed further south, through a cutting in the hill south of Surbiton
Surbiton railway station opened in 1838, and was originally named Kingston-upon-Railway
It was only renamed Surbiton to distinguish it from the new Kingston railway station on the Shepperton branch line, which opened on 1 January 1869
The present station has an art deco façade.
As a result, Kingston is now on a branch line, whereas passengers from Surbiton (smaller in comparison) can reach London Waterloo in as little as 16 minutes on a fast direct service; as well as places further afield, including Portsmouth and Southampton.
Surbiton was once home to Surbiton Studios which were owned by Stoll Pictures, before the company shifted its main production to Cricklewood Studios.
Surbiton falls within the UK parliamentary constituency of Kingston and Surbiton, which is represented in the House of Commons by Sir Ed Davey, a Liberal Democrat who served as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change during the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition
Davey also represented the constituency between 1997 and 2015, having been ousted for a short period of time by Conservative James Berry
In the 2017 general election, Davey went on to defeat Berry by 45% to 38%
Both Davey's and Berry's offices were located in Surbiton's Berrylands ward.
In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Kingston and Surbiton voted to remain a member of the European Union by 61.7% of the local vote.
Surbiton is represented in the London Assembly by Conservative Tony Arbour, as part of Greater London's South West constituency.
Surbiton elects 12 of the Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council's 48 councillors
As of the 2018 local elections, the council is controlled by the Liberal Democrats, and all Surbiton's elected councillors are members of that party.
Surbiton is served by a number of regular bus services
Transport for London bus routes 71, 281, 406, 418, 465, K1, K2, K3, and K4, as well as Hallmark Connections route 458, Reptons Coaches route 513, Falcon Coaches routes 514 and 515, and Stagecoach South route 715 all serve the area
These provide links to Chessington, Kingston town centre, Twickenham, Hounslow, Epsom, Leatherhead, Dorking, Cobham, Staines, Weybridge and Guildford.
Surbiton is also close to two of London's largest airports: Heathrow and Gatwick.
Railways have served the town since it was founded
Surbiton and Berrylands stations are both served by South Western Railway services
It provides rail links to London Waterloo, Surrey and Hampshire.
If approval is granted for the project, Surbiton will be connected with the London Underground system via Crossrail 2
It is expected that the project will relieve pressure on both Surbiton and Berrylands stations.
Surbiton lacks major motorways, although the A3 road cuts through Berrylands ward at Tolworth Underpass
Parts of the A307 that run along the River Thames, Portsmouth Road, have become part of the London cycle routes network.
Until the early 19th century, Surbiton, like Norbiton, lay in the parish of All Saints, Kingston upon Thames
As a result, Surbiton's two town centre parish churches, Saint Mark's and Saint Andrew's, date back only to the Victorian era.
There are two further Anglican parish churches in south Surbiton, Christ Church and Saint Matthew's, both also Victorian.
Christ Church was built in 1862–63, by Charles Lock Luck and lengthened in 1866
The chancel aisles were added in 1864, and 1871
It has no tower, and is built of red brick with stone dressings with some black brick voussoirs
The east stained glass window was done by Clayton and Bell, the central stained glass window by Burne-Jones, while the other stained glass was done by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake.
Saint Matthew's was completed in 1875, having taken less than 2 years to build
The church and the original vicarage were paid for by one man, William Matthew Coulthurst, who was the senior partner of Coutts Bank
On the outside of the east end of the church, there is a stone plaque recording this and the fact that it was partly built in memory of Hannah Mabella Coulthurst, the dead sister of William Matthew Coulthurst
Built into the wall behind the plaque, there is a photograph of Hannah, a copy of 'The Times' newspaper of the day and a letter from William Coulthurst stipulating that the church should remain in the evangelical tradition
The church and vicarage cost £26,500
The old vicarage was pulled down in 1939 and a subsequent one was built on the same plot
In 2012, work started on a new vicarage on part of the plot and this was completed in 2013.
Other churches in Surbiton include Surbiton Hill Methodist Church on Ewell Road, opened in 1882, and the Roman Catholic church of Saint Raphael's, completed in 1848 and located to the north of Surbiton, in the Kingston upon Thames postal district.
In recent years, Surbiton has become more diverse in terms of religion, the Surbiton area having a Sikh Gurdwara and an Orthodox Jewish synagogue
According to the 2011 Census, Muslims form the largest minority religious community at about 5% of the population; the nearest mosque is located in Kingston upon Thames.
Approximately 74% of Surbiton's residents at the 2011 Census were born in the United Kingdom (73% in Alexandra, 71% in St
Mark's, 75% in Surbiton Hill, 76% in Berrylands)
The largest ethnic group, with two-thirds of the population, is "White British", with "White Other" the second largest group at just under 10%.
Surbiton Lawn Tennis Club hosted international tennis from 1900 (Surrey Grass Court Championships - SGCC) until 1981 at the tennis Club in Berrylands
From 1998 to 2008 international tennis returned to Surbiton with an event hosted by the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) and Surbiton Racket & Fitness Club (SRFC)
The Surbiton Trophy was part of the ATP Challenger Series and in 2009 the event was moved to Nottingham as part of a reorganisation by the LTA
The event came back to SRFC in 2015 and continues to be played at Berrylands.

The Pre-Raphaelite painters John Everett Millais (1829–1896) and William Holman Hunt (1827–1910) came to Surbiton in 1851, 26 years before Richard Jefferies (1848–1887)
Millais used the Hogsmill River, in Six Acre Meadow, Tolworth, as the background for his painting Ophelia
Holman Hunt used the fields just south of this spot as the background to The Hireling Shepherd.
In the mid-1870s the novelist Thomas Hardy (1840–1928) lived in a house called 'St
David's Villa' in Hook Road, Surbiton for a year after his marriage to Emma Gifford

Surbiton was the setting of Keble Howard's novel The Smiths of Surbiton, published in 1906

A 1972 episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus featured a mock documentary which investigated whether the residents of Hounslow, another London area suburb, had long ago been descendants of the people of Surbiton "who had made the great trek north".
Surbiton is popularly remembered as an icon of suburbia in such British television programmes as The Good Life (starring Richard Briers, Penelope Keith, Paul Eddington and Felicity Kendal), though location filming was done in Northwood, North-West London, and John Sessions and Phil Cornwell's comedy series Stella Street.
