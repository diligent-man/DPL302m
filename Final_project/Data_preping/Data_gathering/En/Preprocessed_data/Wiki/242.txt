medical subject headings mesh is a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for the purpose of indexing journal articles and books in the life sciences
it serves as a thesaurus that facilitates searching
created and updated by the united states national library of medicine nlm it is used by the medline pubmed article database and by nlm s catalog of book holdings
mesh is also used by clinicaltrials gov registry to classify which diseases are studied by trials registered in clinicaltrials
mesh was introduced in the s with the nlm s own index catalogue and the subject headings of the quarterly cumulative index medicus edition as precursors
the yearly printed version of mesh was discontinued in mesh is now available only online
it can be browsed and downloaded free of charge through pubmed
originally in english mesh has been translated into numerous other languages and allows retrieval of documents from different origins
mesh vocabulary is divided into four types of terms
the main ones are the headings also known as mesh headings or descriptors which describe the subject of each article e g body weight brain edema or critical care nursing
most of these are accompanied by a short description or definition links to related descriptors and a list of synonyms or very similar terms known as entry terms
mesh contains approximately entries and is updated annually to reflect changes in medicine and medical terminology
mesh terms are arranged in alphabetic order and in a hierarchical structure by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms
when we search for a mesh term the most specific mesh terms are automatically included in the search
this is known as the extended search or explode of that mesh term
this additional information and the hierarchical structure see below make the mesh essentially a thesaurus rather than a plain subject headings list
the second type of term mesh subheadings or qualifiers see below can be used with mesh terms to more completely describe a particular aspect of a subject such as adverse diagnostic or genetic effects
for example the drug therapy of asthma is displayed as asthma drug therapy
the remaining two types of term are those that describe the type of material that the article represents publication types and supplementary concept records scr which describes substances such as chemical products and drugs that are not included in the headings see below as supplements
the descriptors or subject headings are arranged in a hierarchy
a given descriptor may appear at several locations in the hierarchical tree
the tree locations carry systematic labels known as tree numbers and consequently one descriptor can carry several tree numbers
for example the descriptor digestive system neoplasms has the tree numbers c and c c stands for diseases c for digestive system diseases and c for digestive system neoplasms c for neoplasms c for neoplasms by site and c also for digestive system neoplasms
the tree numbers of a given descriptor are subject to change as mesh is updated
every descriptor also carries a unique alphanumerical id that will not change
most subject headings come with a short description or definition
see the mesh description for diabetes type as an example
the explanatory text is written by the mesh team based on their standard sources if not otherwise stated
references are mostly encyclopaedias and standard textbooks of the subject areas
references for specific statements in the descriptions are not given instead readers are referred to the bibliography
in addition to the descriptor hierarchy mesh contains a small number of standard qualifiers also known as subheadings which can be added to descriptors to narrow down the topic
for example measles is a descriptor and epidemiology is a qualifier measles epidemiology describes the subheading of epidemiological articles about measles
the epidemiology qualifier can be added to all other disease descriptors
not all descriptor qualifier combinations are allowed since some of them may be meaningless
in all there are different qualifiers
in addition to the descriptors mesh also contains some supplementary concept records
these do not belong to the controlled vocabulary as such instead they enlarge the thesaurus and contain links to the closest fitting descriptor to be used in a medline search
many of these records describe chemical substances
in medline pubmed every journal article is indexed with about subject headings subheadings and supplementary concept records with some of them designated as major and marked with an asterisk indicating the article s major topics
when performing a medline search via pubmed entry terms are automatically translated into i e
mapped to the corresponding descriptors with a good degree of reliability it is recommended to check the details tab in pubmed to see how a search formulation was translated
by default a search for a descriptor will include all the descriptors in the hierarchy below the given one
pubmed does not apply automatic mapping of the term in the following circumstances by writing the quoted phrase e g kidney allograft when truncated on the asterisk e g kidney allograft and when looking with field labels e g cancer ti
at clinicaltrials gov each trial has keywords that describe the trial
the clinicaltrials gov team assigns each trial two sets of mesh terms
one set is for the conditions studied by the trial and the other for the set of interventions used in the trial
the xml file that can be downloaded for each trial contains these mesh keywords
the xml file also has a comment that says the assignment of mesh keywords is done by imperfect algorithm
the top level categories in the mesh descriptor hierarchy are
anatomy a
organisms b
diseases c
chemicals and drugs d
analytical diagnostic and therapeutic techniques and equipment e
psychiatry and psychology f
phenomena and processes g
disciplines and occupations h
anthropology education sociology and social phenomena i
