At the outbreak of the Revolution in he dropped everything and returned to Paris where his lead actor's voice his writing skills and his ability to organise and direct large-scale ftes civic feasts were to make him famous
He contributed to revolutionary agitation from the very beginning but it was not until that he became a figure of importance
With the publication of L'Almanach du Pre Grard a book advocating a constitutional monarchy in popular terms he suddenly acquired great popularity
His fame was soon increased by his involvement on behalf of the Swiss of the Chteau-Vieux Regiment condemned to the galleys for mutiny at Nancy
Collot d'Herbois' efforts resulted in their freedom he went to Brest in search of them and a civic feast was held on his behalf and theirs which occasioned a poem by Andr de Chnier

In June he was made president of the Convention and in September he joined the Committee of Public Safety where he was active as a sort of general secretary
After having entrusted him with several missions to Nice Nevers and Compigne the Convention sent him along with Joseph Fouch on October to punish the revolt of Lyon
There he introduced the Reign of Terror in its most violent form with mass executions including more than a hundred priests and nuns and beginning the dismantling of the city itself
His excessive behavior led the Committee of Public Safety to have Collot return to Paris as a suspect
The month of May saw assassination attempts on both himself on the rd and on Maximilien Robespierre on the th
As Collot was accused of excessive slaughter and destruction and he suspected that he might soon be arrested and executed he opposed Robespierre during the Thermidorian Reaction when he presided over the Convention during the initial session
