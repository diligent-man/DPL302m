national income accounting acquisition government good service current use directly satisfy individual collective need community classed government final consumption expenditure
government acquisition good service intended create future benefit infrastructure investment research spending classed government investment government gross capital formation
two type government spending final consumption gross capital formation together constitute one major component gross domestic product
government spending financed government borrowing tax custom duty sale lease natural resource various fee like national park entry fee licensing fees
government choose borrow money pay interest money borrowed
change government spending major component fiscal policy used stabilize macroeconomic business cycle
fiscal policy defined use government spending andor taxation mechanism influence economy
two type fiscal policy expansionary fiscal policy contractionary fiscal policy
expansionary fiscal policy increase government spending decrease taxation contractionary fiscal policy decrease government spending increase taxes
expansionary fiscal policy used government stimulate economy recession
example increase government spending directly increase demand good service help increase output employment
hand contractionary fiscal policy used government cool economy economic boom
economic downturn short run government spending changed either via automatic stabilization discretionary stabilization
automatic stabilization existing policy automatically change government spending tax response economic change without additional passage laws
primary example automatic stabilizer unemployment insurance provides financial assistance unemployed workers
discretionary stabilization government take action change government spending tax direct response change economy
instance government may decide increase government spending result recession
discretionary stabilization government must pas new law make change government spending
john maynard keynes wa one first economist advocate government deficit spending part fiscal policy response economic contraction
according keynesian economics increased government spending raise aggregate demand increase consumption lead increased production faster recovery recessions
classical economist hand believe increased government spending exacerbates economic contraction shifting resource private sector consider productive public sector consider unproductive
economics potential shifting resource private sector public sector result increase government deficit spending called crowding out
figure right depicts market capital otherwise known market loanable funds
downward sloping demand curve represents demand private capital firm investor upward sloping supply curve represents saving private individuals
initial equilibrium market represented point equilibrium quantity capital k equilibrium interest rate r
government increase deficit spending borrow money private capital market reduce supply saving s
new equilibrium point b interest rate ha increased r quantity capital available private sector ha decreased k
government ha essentially made borrowing expensive ha taken away saving market crowd private investment
crowding private investment could limit economic growth initial increase government spending
explanation impact government spending come conventional orthodox economics set model predict largest economic event last yearsthe global financial crisis gfc sub-prime mortgage derivative meltdown
although economics provokes controversy empirical evidence orthodox economics valid explaining current condition least questionable
see steve keen's debunking economics naked emperor dethroned complete account failings
matt stoller fellow open market institute say point orthodox economics create language methodology governing hide political assumption public calling science conventional sense word least open question
among questionable concept orthodox economics promotes crowding presumes economy zero-sum game
true assumption resource utilized government employ additional resource must expense private sector
economy writing current capacity never mind adding capacity covid- epidemic proceeds figure likely go lower
realistic economics would conclude government spending would employ idle resource crowd private use resources
government spent new deal big public work project like world war ii
one could conclude additional gdp grown wa result bringing resource un- under-employed great depression back production
orthodox economist contend government 'borrowing' competes saving too
orthodox model say government try borrow issuing selling bond competition finance would push interest rate emphasis added
private firm would decide borrow higher rate hence investment would lower
also durable consumption expenditure household decline financed borrowing
government fiscal deficit generate non-government surplus flow accumulate non-government sector's net acquisition financial asset stock
since saving result higher income level arising deficit greater financial wealth true government competing private sector borrower limited supply saving flow place government bond wealth portfolio fixed size
saving portfolio expand government deficit grow contrariwise government practice austerity saving shrink economic instability grows
historically whenever government ha succumbed siren song fiscal responsibility significantly reduced deficit economy go tailspin time
perhaps clearest evidence failing orthodox economics' prediction consequence larger government 'debt'
note government 'debt' nothing like household debt like bank debt
bank account asset bank liability 'debt' reducing bank's 'debt' reduces size depositors' accounts
paragraph indicates follows reducing people's saving economic downturn replete wave asset forfeiture foreclosure people unable pay obligation reduced savings
discouraged government 'debt' orthodox economics blessed clinton federal budget surplus deregulated market reduced government spending encouraged wall street's derivative led gfc in
despite event according orthodox economics there's threshold government debt beyond economy suffers bond market demand higher interest rate cannot sell government debt
people often point greece ha pay high interest rate borrow example
unlike u greece longer make currency comparable monetary sovereign print mean repay 'debt' credit risk monetary sovereign floating exchange rate print mean repay 'debt' would credit risk bank would unable pay depositor could print banknotes
orthodox economist reinhart rogoff even wrote study concluding government 'debt' larger gdp impaired economic performance
however others examined work found cherry-picked example even mistake spreadsheet formula used calculate result
japan make fiat currency yen ha floating exchange rate
current 'debt to-gdp ratio roughly far reinhart rogoff's threshold
orthodox economics school would conclude japanese borrowed much impaired ability repay government 'debt' therefore orthodox economics prediction bond market would charge risk premium higher interest rate japan's central bank could sell yen-denominated bonds
truth national debt japan sell near zero interest rate
conclusion stir controversy contradict narrative widely disseminated press orthodox economic journals
heterodox economist found journal deal difficulty getting tenure employment result conclusions
nevertheless event cited federal reserve's response gfc extending trillion credit financial sector current multi-trillion-dollar response covid- pandemic appear validate conclusion heterodox economist particularly modern money theory

government spending government expenditure divided three primary group government consumption transfer payment interest payments
example include road infrastructure repair national defence school healthcare government worker salaries
investment science strategic technological innovation serve public needs
payment made without exchange good service example old age security payment employment insurance benefit veteran civil service pension foreign aid social assistance payments
interest payment interest paid holder government bond saving bond treasury billsthe united state spends vastly country national defense
example united state approved budget billion discretionary military spending china wa second estimated billion dollar military spending
table show top country largest military expenditure recent year publicly available data
table suggests united state spent nearly time much military china country next largest military spending
military budget dwarfed spending country top country spending le billion in
omnibus spending package increased military budget another billion increasing united state largest defense spenders

government acquisition intended create future benefit infrastructure investment research spending called gross fixed capital formation government investment usually largest part government
acquisition good service made production government using government's labour force fixed asset purchased good service intermediate consumption purchase good service market producers
economic theory macroeconomics investment amount purchased good consumed used future production ie
infrastructure spending considered government investment usually save money long run thereby reduce net present value government liabilities
return average spent nonresidential construction almost always le expensive maintain repair replace ha become unusable
likewise government spending social infrastructure preventative health care save several hundred billion dollar per year u example cancer patient likely diagnosed stage curative treatment typically outpatient visit instead stage iii later emergency room treatment involve year hospitalization often terminal
