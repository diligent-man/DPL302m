k at metres ft above sea level is the second highest mountain on earth after mount everest at metres ft
it lies in the karakoram range partially in the gilgit baltistan region of pakistan administered kashmir and partially in a china administered territory of the kashmir region included in the taxkorgan tajik autonomous county of xinjiang
k also became popularly known as the savage mountain after george bell a climber on the american expedition told reporters it s a savage mountain that tries to kill you of the five highest mountains in the world k is the deadliest approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who reach the summit
also occasionally known as mount godwin austen other nicknames for k are the king of mountains and the mountaineers mountain as well as the mountain of mountains after prominent italian climber reinhold messner titled his book about k the same
the summit was reached for the first time by the italian climbers lino lacedelli and achille compagnoni on the italian expedition led by ardito desio
in january k became the final eight thousander to be summited in the winter the mountaineering feat was accomplished by a team of nepalese climbers led by nirmal purja and mingma gyalje sherpa
k is the only metre peak that has never been climbed from its eastern face
ascents have almost always been made in july and august which are typically the warmest times of the year k s more northern location makes it more susceptible to inclement and colder weather
the peak has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges
although the summit of everest is at a higher altitude k is a more difficult and dangerous climb due in part to its more inclement weather
as of february only people have completed the ascent to its summit
there have been deaths during attempted climbs according to the list maintained on the list of deaths on eight thousanders
the name k is derived from notation used by the great trigonometrical survey of british india
thomas montgomerie made the first survey of the karakoram from mount haramukh some km mi to the south and sketched the two most prominent peaks labelling them k and k where the k stands for karakoram
the policy of the great trigonometrical survey was to use local names for mountains wherever possible and k was found to be known locally as masherbrum
k however appeared not to have acquired a local name possibly due to its remoteness
the mountain is not visible from askole the last village to the south or from the nearest habitation to the north and is only fleetingly glimpsed from the end of the baltoro glacier beyond which few local people would have ventured
the name chogori derived from two balti words chhogo big and ri mountain has been suggested as a local name but evidence for its widespread use is scant
it may have been a compound name invented by western explorers or simply a bemused reply to the question what s that called it does however form the basis for the name qogir simplified chinese traditional chinese pinyin qi og l f ng by which chinese authorities officially refer to the peak
other local names have been suggested including lamba pahar tall mountain in urdu and dapsang but are not widely used
with the mountain lacking a local name the name mount godwin austen was suggested in honour of henry godwin austen an early explorer of the area
while the name was rejected by the royal geographical society it was used on several maps and continues to be used occasionally
the surveyor s mark k therefore continues to be the name by which the mountain is commonly known
it is now also used in the balti language rendered as kechu or ketu balti urdu
the italian climber fosco maraini argued in his account of the ascent of gasherbrum iv that while the name of k owes its origin to chance its clipped impersonal nature is highly appropriate for so remote and challenging a mountain
he concluded that it was
andr weil named k surfaces in mathematics partly after the beauty of the mountain k
k lies in the northwestern karakoram range
it is located in the baltistan region of gilgit baltistan pakistan and the taxkorgan tajik autonomous county of xinjiang china
the tarim sedimentary basin borders the range on the north and the lesser himalayas on the south
melt waters from glaciers such as those south and east of k feed agriculture in the valleys and contribute significantly to the regional fresh water supply
k is ranked nd by topographic prominence a measure of a mountain s independent stature
it is a part of the same extended area of uplift including the karakoram the tibetan plateau and the himalaya as mount everest and it is possible to follow a path from k to everest that goes no lower than metres ft at the kora la on the nepal china border in the mustang lo
many other peaks far lower than k are more independent in this sense
it is however the most prominent peak within the karakoram range
k is notable for its local relief as well as its total height
it stands over metres ft above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base
it is a consistently steep pyramid dropping quickly in almost all directions
the north side is the steepest there it rises over metres ft above the k qogir glacier in only metres ft of horizontal distance
in most directions it achieves over metres ft of vertical relief in less than metres ft
a expedition led by george wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that k was taller than mount everest and therefore the tallest mountain in the world
a corrected measurement was made in but by then the claim that k was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works
k s height given on maps and encyclopedias is metres ft
in the summer of a pakistani italian expedition to k named k years later was organized to commemorate the th anniversary of the first ascent of k
one of the goals of the expedition was to accurately measure the height of the mountain using satellite navigation
the height of k measured during this expedition was metres ft
the mountains of k and broad peak and the area westward to the lower reaches of sarpo laggo glacier consist of metamorphic rocks known as the k gneiss and part of the karakoram metamorphic complex
the k gneiss consists of a mixture of orthogneiss and biotite rich paragneiss
on the south and southeast face of k the orthogneiss consists of a mixture of a strongly foliated plagioclase hornblende gneiss and a biotite hornblende k feldspar orthogneiss which has been intruded by garnet mica leucogranitic dikes
in places the paragneisses include clinopyroxene hornblende bearing psammites garnet grossular diopside marbles and biotite graphite phyllites
near the memorial to the climbers who have died on k above base camp on the south spur thin impure marbles with quartzites and mica schists called the gilkey puchoz sequence are interbanded within the orthogneisses
on the west face of broad peak and south spur of k lamprophyre dikes which consist of clinopyroxene and biotite porphyritic vogesites and minettes have intruded the k gneiss
the k gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the surrounding karakoram metamorphic complex by normal faults
for example a fault separates the k gneiss of the east face of k from limestones and slates comprising nearby skyang kangri
ar ar ages of to million years ago obtained from and geochemical analyses of the k gneiss demonstrate that it is a metamorphosed older cretaceous pre collisional granite
the granitic precursor protolith to the k gneiss originated as the result of the production of large bodies of magma by a northward dipping subduction zone along what was the continental margin of asia at that time and their intrusion as batholiths into its lower continental crust
during the initial collision of the asia and indian plates this granitic batholith was buried to depths of about kilometres mi or more highly metamorphosed highly deformed and partially remelted during the eocene period to form gneiss
later the k gneiss was then intruded by leucogranite dikes and finally exhumed and uplifted along major breakback thrust faults during post miocene time
the k gneiss was exposed as the entire k broad peak gasherbrum range experienced rapid uplift with which erosion rates have been unable to keep pace
the mountain was first surveyed by a british team in
team member thomas montgomerie designated the mountain k for being the second peak of the karakoram range
the other peaks were originally named k k k and k but were eventually renamed masherbrum gasherbrum iv gasherbrum ii and gasherbrum i respectively
in martin conway led a british expedition that reached concordia on the baltoro glacier
the first serious attempt to climb k was undertaken in by oscar eckenstein aleister crowley jules jacot guillarmod heinrich pfannl victor wessely and guy knowles via the northeast ridge
in the early s modern transportation did not exist in the region it took fourteen days just to reach the foot of the mountain
after five serious and costly attempts the team reached metres ft although considering the difficulty of the challenge and the lack of modern climbing equipment or weatherproof fabrics crowley s statement that neither man nor beast was injured highlights the relative skill of the ascent
the failures were also attributed to sickness crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria a combination of questionable physical training personality conflicts and poor weather conditions of days spent on k at the time the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude only eight provided clear weather
the next expedition to k in led by prince luigi amedeo duke of the abruzzi reached an elevation of around metres ft on the south east spur now known as the abruzzi spur or abruzzi ridge
this would eventually become part of the standard route but was abandoned at the time due to its steepness and difficulty
after trying and failing to find a feasible alternative route on the west ridge or the north east ridge the duke declared that k would never be climbed and the team switched its attention to chogolisa where the duke came within metres ft of the summit before being driven back by a storm
the next attempt on k was not made until when the first american karakoram expedition led by charles houston made a reconnaissance of the mountain
they concluded that the abruzzi spur was the most practical route and reached a height of around metres ft before turning back due to diminishing supplies and the threat of bad weather
the following year the american karakoram expedition led by fritz wiessner came within metres ft of the summit but ended in disaster when dudley wolfe pasang kikuli pasang kitar and pintso disappeared high on the mountain
charles houston returned to k to lead the american expedition
the attempt failed after a storm pinned down the team for days at metres ft during which time climber art gilkey became critically ill
a desperate retreat followed during which pete schoening saved almost the entire team during a mass fall known simply as the belay and gilkey was killed either in an avalanche or in a deliberate attempt to avoid burdening his companions
despite the retreat and tragic end the expedition has been given iconic status in mountaineering history
the gilkey memorial was built in his memory at the mountain s foot
the italian karakoram expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of k via the abruzzi spur on july
the expedition was led by ardito desio and the two climbers who reached the summit were lino lacedelli and achille compagnoni
the team included a pakistani member colonel muhammad ata ullah who had been a part of the american expedition
also on the expedition were walter bonatti and pakistani hunza porter amir mehdi who both proved vital to the expedition s success in that they carried oxygen tanks to metres ft for lacedelli and compagnoni
the ascent is controversial because lacedelli and compagnoni established their camp at a higher elevation than originally agreed with mehdi and bonatti
it being too dark to ascend or descend mehdi and bonatti were forced to overnight without shelter above metres leaving the oxygen tanks behind as requested when they descended
bonatti and mehdi survived but mehdi was hospitalised for months and had to have his toes amputated because of frostbite
efforts in the s to suppress these facts to protect lacedelli and compagnoni s reputations as italian national heroes were later brought to light
it was also revealed that the moving of the camp was deliberate a move apparently made because compagnoni feared being outshone by the younger bonatti
bonatti was given the blame for mehdi s hospitalisation
on august years after the italian expedition ichiro yoshizawa led the second successful ascent with ashraf aman as the first native pakistani climber
the japanese expedition took the abruzzi spur and used more than porters
the third ascent of k was in via a new route the long and corniced northeast ridge
the top of the route traversed left across the east face to avoid a vertical headwall and joined the uppermost part of the abruzzi route
this ascent was made by an american team led by james whittaker the summit party was louis reichardt jim wickwire john roskelley and rick ridgeway
wickwire endured an overnight bivouac about metres ft below the summit one of the highest bivouacs in history
this ascent was emotional for the american team as they saw themselves as completing a task that had been begun by the team forty years earlier
another notable japanese ascent was that of the difficult north ridge on the chinese side of the peak in
a team from the japan mountaineering association ja led by isao shinkai and masatsugo konishi ja put three members naoe sakashita hiroshi yoshino and yukihiro yanagisawa on the summit on august
however yanagisawa fell and died on the descent
four other members of the team achieved the summit the next day
the first climber to reach the summit of k twice was czech climber josef rakoncaj
rakoncaj was a member of the italian expedition led by francesco santon which made the second successful ascent of the north ridge july
three years later on july he reached the summit via the abruzzi spur double with broad peak west face solo as a member of agostino da polenza s international expedition
the first woman to summit k was polish climber wanda rutkiewicz on june
liliane and maurice barrard who had summitted later that day fell during the descent liliane barrard s body was found on july at the foot of the south face
in two polish expeditions summitted via two new routes the magic line and the polish line jerzy kukuczka and tadeusz piotrowski
piotrowski fell to his death as the two were descending
this latter route has never been repeated
thirteen climbers from several expeditions died in the k disaster
another six mountaineers died on august while eleven climbers died in the k disaster
in the spanish climber carlos soria font n became the oldest person ever to summit k at the age of
on august a group of climbers went missing after a large piece of ice fell during an avalanche taking out the fixed ropes on part of the route four climbers were rescued but including meherban karim from pakistan and ger mcdonnell the first irish person to reach the summit were confirmed dead
despite several attempts nobody reached the summit
on august fredrik ericsson who intended to ski from the summit joined gerlinde kaltenbrunner on the way to the summit of k
ericsson fell metres ft and was killed
kaltenbrunner aborted her summit attempt
despite several attempts nobody reached the summit
on august a team of four climbers reached the summit of k from the north side
gerlinde kaltenbrunner became the first woman to complete all eight thousanders without supplemental oxygen
kazakhs maxut zhumayev and vassiliy pivtsov completed their eight thousanders quest
the fourth team member was dariusz za uski from poland
the year started with a russian team aiming for a first winter ascent
the expedition ended with the death of vitaly gorelik due to frostbite and pneumonia
the russian team cancelled the ascent
in the summer season k saw a record crowd standing on its summit climbers in a single day bringing the total for the year to
on july two new zealanders marty schmidt and his son denali died after an avalanche destroyed their camp
a guide had reached their camp but said they were nowhere to be seen and the campsite tent showed signs of having been hit by an avalanche
british climber adrian hayes who was with the group later posted on his facebook page that the campsite had been wiped out
on july the first team of pakistani climbers scaled k
there were six pakistani and three italian climbers in the expedition called k years later according to bbc
previously k had only been summitted by individual pakistanis as part of international expeditions
another team consisting of pasang lhamu sherpa akita maya sherpa and dawa yangzum sherpa became the first nepali women to climb k
on july garrett madison led a team of three american climbers and six sherpas to summit k
on july boyan petrov completed the first bulgarian ascent just days after climbing broad peak
boyan is among the very few climbers with diabetes to climb above m without the use of supplemental oxygen
on july vanessa o brien led an international team of with mingma gyalje sherpa of dreamers destination to the summit of k and became the first british and american woman to summit k and the eldest woman to summit k at the age of years old
she paid tribute to julie tullis and alison hargreaves two british women who summited k in and respectively but died during their descents
other notable summits included john snorri sigurj nsson and dawa gyalje sherpa who joined his sister dawa yangzum sherpa becoming the second set of siblings to summit k
both mingma gyalje sherpa and fazal ali recorded their second k summits
on july garrett madison became the first american climber to reach the summit of k more than once when he led an international team of eight climbers nine nepali sherpas four pakistani high altitude porters and two other madison mountaineering guides to the summit
on july polish mountaineer and mountain runner andrzej bargiel became the first person to ski down from summit to base camp
on july anja blacha became the first german woman to summit k
she climbed without the use of supplemental oxygen polish canadian british expedition led by andrzej zawada from the pakistani side consisting of poles canadians and brits
march krzysztof wielicki and leszek cichy established camp iii at metres above sea followed by roger mear and jean francois gagnon few days later
hurricane winds and frostbite forced the team to retreat
netia k polish winter expedition
the team of fourteen climbers was led by krzysztof wielicki and included four members from kazakhstan uzbekistan and georgia
they intended to climb north ridge
marcin kaczkan piotr morawski and denis urubko established camp iv at metres above sea level
the final ascent started by kaczkan and urubko failed due to the destruction of the tent by harsh weather in camp iv and kaczkan s cerebral edema
russian expedition
nine russian climbers attempted k s abruzzi spur route
they managed to reach metres above sea level vitaly gorelik valery shamalo and nicholas totmyanin but had to retreat due to hurricane force winds as well as frostbite on both of gorelik s hands
after their descent to base camp and an unsuccessful call for gorelik s evacuation helicopter could not reach them through the worsening weather the climber died of pneumonia and cardiac arrest
following the incident the expedition was called off
polish national winter expedition led by krzysztof wielicki consisting of climbers started in the end of december
the team initially attempted to summit via the south southeastern spur cesen route switching to the abruzzi spur after an injury on the previous route
via the cesen basque route they reached up to m while on the abruzzi spur route they reached up to m
however denis urubko reported that during his solo attempt he probably reached up to m
ten climbers from an international expedition made the first winter summit on january
the group all summited together and consisted of mingma gyalje sherpa nirmal purja gelje sherpa mingma david sherpa mingma tenzi sherpa dawa temba sherpa pem chhiri sherpa kilu pemba sherpa dawa tenjing sherpa and sona sherpa
the summiting group consisted entirely of indigenous climbers from nepal
nirmal purja was the only one who reached the summit without the use of supplemental oxygen
the summit temperature was celsius
on the same day spanish team member sergi mingote died on the descent from camp iii he fell somewhere between camp i and advanced base camp
other famous climbers who lost their lives on the same expedition include atanas skatov ali sadpara and john snorri there are a number of routes on k of somewhat different character but they all share some key difficulties the first being the extremely high altitude and resulting lack of oxygen there is only one third as much oxygen available to a climber on the summit of k as there is at sea level
the second is the propensity of the mountain to experience extreme storms of several days duration which have resulted in many of the deaths on the peak
the third is the steep exposed and committing nature of all routes on the mountain which makes retreat more difficult especially during a storm
despite many attempts the first successful winter ascents occurred only in
all major climbing routes lie on the pakistani side
the base camp is also located on the pakistani side
the standard route of ascent used by of all climbers is the abruzzi spur located on the pakistani side first attempted by prince luigi amedeo duke of the abruzzi in
this is the peak s southeast ridge rising above the godwin austen glacier
the spur proper begins at an altitude of metres ft where advanced base camp is usually placed
the route follows an alternating series of rock ribs snow ice fields and some technical rock climbing on two famous features house s chimney and the black pyramid above the black pyramid dangerously exposed and difficult to navigate slopes lead to the easily visible shoulder and thence to the summit
the last major obstacle is a narrow couloir known as the bottleneck which places climbers dangerously close to a wall of seracs that form an ice cliff to the east of the summit
it was partly due to the collapse of one of these seracs around that no climbers reached the summit in and
on august climbers from several expeditions died during a series of accidents including several ice falls in the bottleneck
almost opposite from the abruzzi spur is the north ridge which ascends the chinese side of the peak
it is rarely climbed partly due to very difficult access involving crossing the shaksgam river which is a hazardous undertaking
in contrast to the crowds of climbers and trekkers at the abruzzi basecamp usually at most two teams are encamped below the north ridge
this route more technically difficult than the abruzzi ascends a long steep primarily rock ridge to high on the mountain camp iv the eagle s nest at metres ft and then crosses a dangerously slide prone hanging glacier by a leftward climbing traverse to reach a snow couloir which accesses the summit
besides the original japanese ascent a notable ascent of the north ridge was the one in by greg child greg mortimer and steve swenson which was done alpine style above camp though using some fixed ropes already put in place by a japanese team
because of people who climb k use the abruzzi spur these listed routes are rarely climbed
no one has climbed the east face of the mountain due to the instability of the snow and ice formations on that side
besides the east face the north face has not yet been climbed either
in denis urubko and serguey samoilov intended to climb the k s north face but they were stymied by increasingly deteriorating conditions
after finding their intended route menaced by growing avalanche danger they traversed onto the normal north ridge route and summited on october making the latest summer season ascent of the peak in history
northeast ridge
long and corniced finishes on uppermost part of abruzzi route
ridge first crossed by a polish expedition led by janusz kurczab in
the team was not able to summit due to poor weather
first climbed by louis reichardt and james wickwire on september west ridge
first climbed in by a japanese team
this route starts on the distant negrotto glacier and goes through unpredictable bands of rock and snowfields southwest pillar or magic line
very technical and second most demanding
first climbed in by the polish slovak trio piasecki wr bo ik
since then jordi corominas from spain has been the only successful climber on this route he summitted in despite many other attempts south face or polish line or central rib
extremely exposed demanding and dangerous
in july jerzy kukuczka and tadeusz piotrowski summitted on this route
piotrowski was killed while descending on the abruzzi spur
the route starts off the first part of the southwest pillar and then deviates into a totally exposed snow covered cliff area then through a gully known as the hockey stick and then goes up to yet another exposed cliff face and the route continues through yet another extremely exposed section all the way up to the point where the route joins with the abruzzi spur about m ft before the summit
reinhold messner called it a suicidal route and so far no one has repeated kukuczka and piotrowski s achievement
the route is so avalanche prone that no one else has ever considered a new attempt northwest face
first ascent via this route was in by a japanese team this route is located on the chinese side of the mountain
this route is known for its chaotic rock and snowfields all the way up to the summit northwest ridge
first climbed in by a french team pierre beghin and christophe profit
finishes on north ridge
second attempt in by an american team they reached metres the august before turning back in deteriorating weather south southeast spur or cesen route or basque route
it runs the pillar between the abruzzi spur and the polish route
it connects with the abruzzi spur on the shoulder above the black pyramid and below the bottleneck since it avoids the black pyramid it is considered safer
in tomo esen ascended to m ft via this route
the first summit via this route was by a basque team in west face
technical difficulty at high altitude first climbed by a russian team in
this route is almost entirely made up of rock crevasses and snow covered couloirs for most of its climbing history k was not usually climbed with supplemental oxygen and small relatively lightweight teams were the norm
however the season saw a great increase in the use of oxygen of summitteers used oxygen in that year
acclimatisation is essential when climbing without oxygen to avoid some degree of altitude sickness
k s summit is well above the altitude at which high altitude pulmonary edema hape or high altitude cerebral edema hace can occur
in mountaineering when ascending above an altitude of metres ft the climber enters what is known as the death zone
