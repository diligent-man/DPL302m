"You and the Night and the Music" is a popular song composed by Arthur Schwartz with lyrics by Howard Dietz.
The song was debuted in the Broadway show Revenge with Music
The show originally opened on November 28, 1934, ran for 22 performances, after which it closed
 It then reopened on December 24, 1934, and ran for an additional 135 performances
Authors Caryl Brahms and Ned Sherrin, in their book Song by Song: 14 Great Lyric Writers, say that “...the musical yielded two enduring hits and a profit although it was an artistic failure.”
Popular recordings in 1935 were by Libby Holman and by Leo Reisman (vocal by Phil Dewey)
The song has since become an enduring jazz standard with notable recordings by Frank Sinatra, Bill Evans, Chet Baker, Stan Getz, Keith Jarrett, Julie London, Jamie Cullum, and Lennie Niehaus.
The song was sampled on The Caretaker’s 1999 album Selected Memories from the Haunted Ballroom as part of the track “You and the Night”.
