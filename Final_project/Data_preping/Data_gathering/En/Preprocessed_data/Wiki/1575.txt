the earliest archaeological remnants discovered in mafra date to an early settlement of this region in the neolithic period
in seixosa civil parish of encarna o in an area that was once a beach there were archaeological remnants from the paleolithic period that indicate one of the oldest human presences in europe
similar human vestiges were discovered along the beach of s o juli o including specifically shell mounds produced by mesolithic communities in the parish of carvoeira
although many of these remnants have been discovered submerged along the coast they have been dated to b c
during the neolithic b c the first agro pastoral communities began to appear remaining in small groups in strategically defensible locations
this includes sites in igreja nova such as penedo do lexim considered an important point in comprehending the neolithic and copper age iberian settlements and occupied during the final part of the neolithic chalcolithic and bronze age
other structures from the neolithic today missing such as the castle of cheleiros or dolmens whose name remains the only proof there is existence such as antas azueira and antas gradil
in addition to the penedo do lexim also in the serra do socorro and tituaria as funerary tombs from the chalcolithic
tombstones altars tombs coins bins ceramics and glass from the roman era have been found in almost all parishes of the municipality
these dates back to the first and fourth century including the roman road connecting sintra and peniche which crosses mafra intersecting the cheleiros mafra ericeira pa o de ilhas and s
domingos da fanga da f where portions of the road have been conserved
in cheleiros and carvoeira there are two bridges constructed by the romans
one of these a bridge in santo isidoro as well as a metre portion of the road that was part of the sintra peniche accessway is a reflection of the areas romanization
an important agriculture centre during the roman occupation anthropologists have discovered roman coins of the eras of augustus b c claudius and magnus maximo
although it is unclear the area s importance within olissipo its agricultural contributions may have contributed to its strong settlement during the period
wine oil and vegetables were easily commercialized across the accessway and along the rivers of cheleiros ilhas and safarujo which were navigable until the middle ages
the occupation by the visigoths occurred after the th century until the arrival of the moors in with few remnants discovered
an inscription encountered in the parochial church of cheleiros a frieze in alcain a and paeleo christian funerary tomb adapted as a bunk within the quinta da corredoura in mafra are the only current manifestations of these peoples
it is certain that the built up urban area of mafra was once a fortified community with the area of rua das tecedeiras being the best example of the walls still being visible
the limits of the castle which was implanted on the neolithic settlement was successively reoccupied until the iron age and taking up the entirety of the old village
this includes the space limited in the east by the largo coronel brito gorj o the south by the rua das tecedeiras west by the pal cio dos marqueses de ponte de lima and north by the rua mafra detr s do castelo
a dense forest that existed until the th century in quinta da cerca in this area that protected and sheltered the settlement from winds

there are suggestions that many of the churches were once mosques such as the matriz church of cheleiros the church of santo andr and the sanctuary of serra do socorro
the origin of the local toponymy mafra is unclear but evolved from variations of mafara malfora and later mafora
some suggest its origin came from the turanian great ara a female fertility cult that may have existed along the rim of the early village
others suggest that it developed from the arabic mahfara which means pit which presumed that the location was implanted within a pit a fact that was disproved by the arabist david lopes
the town is in fact located on a hill with two ravines rio gordo and rio dos couros limiting the area around it

nicolau who received the first foral charter a year later

between and king manuel i issued a new foral to mafra ericeira and cheleiros and in conceded a foral to enxara dos cavaleiros while confirming a foral to gradil then originally donated by afonso iv of portugal in
during the manueline reforms the municipalities that received these forals constructed pillories or required to refurbished their administrative markers
in the census of september there was an estimated residents of which only four couples lived within the village
the reign of manuel i was instrumental in influencing the religious architecture of the region it is present in many of the churches such as nossa senhora da oliveira in sobral da abelheira nossa senhora do reclamador in cheleiros nossa senhora da concei o in igreja nova s o miguel in milharado santa eul lia in santo estev o das gal s or s o silvestre in gradil
