The earliest archaeological remnants discovered in Mafra date to an early settlement of this region in the Neolithic period In Seixosa civil parish of Encarna o in an area that was once a beach there were archaeological remnants from the Paleolithic period that indicate one of the oldest human presences in Europe Similar human vestiges were discovered along the beach of S o Juli o including specifically shell mounds produced by Mesolithic communities in the parish of Carvoeira Although many of these remnants have been discovered submerged along the coast they have been dated to B C During the Neolithic B C the first agro pastoral communities began to appear remaining in small groups in strategically defensible locations This includes sites in Igreja Nova such as Penedo do Lexim considered an important point in comprehending the Neolithic and Copper Age Iberian settlements and occupied during the final part of the Neolithic Chalcolithic and Bronze Age Other structures from the Neolithic today missing such as the castle of Cheleiros or dolmens whose name remains the only proof there is existence such as Antas Azueira and Antas Gradil In addition to the Penedo do Lexim also in the Serra do Socorro and Tituaria as funerary tombs from the Chalcolithic
Tombstones altars tombs coins bins ceramics and glass from the Roman era have been found in almost all parishes of the municipality These dates back to the first and fourth century including the Roman road connecting Sintra and Peniche which crosses Mafra intersecting the Cheleiros Mafra Ericeira Pa o de Ilhas and S Domingos da Fanga da F where portions of the road have been conserved In Cheleiros and Carvoeira there are two bridges constructed by the Romans One of these a bridge in Santo Isidoro as well as a metre portion of the road that was part of the Sintra Peniche accessway is a reflection of the areas Romanization An important agriculture centre during the Roman occupation anthropologists have discovered Roman coins of the eras of Augustus B C Claudius and Magnus Maximo Although it is unclear the area's importance within Olissipo its agricultural contributions may have contributed to its strong settlement during the period Wine oil and vegetables were easily commercialized across the accessway and along the rivers of Cheleiros Ilhas and Safarujo which were navigable until the Middle Ages
