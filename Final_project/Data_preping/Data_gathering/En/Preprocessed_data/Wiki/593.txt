intrauterine system ius with progestogen sold under the brand name mirena among others is an intrauterine device that releases the hormone levonorgestrel into the uterus
it is used for birth control heavy menstrual periods and to prevent excessive build of the lining of the uterus in those on estrogen replacement therapy
it is one of the most effective forms of birth control with a one year failure rate around
the device is placed in the uterus and lasts three to seven years
fertility often returns quickly following removal
side effects include irregular periods benign ovarian cysts pelvic pain and depression
rarely uterine perforation may occur
use is not recommended during pregnancy but is safe with breastfeeding
the iud with progestogen is a type of long acting reversible birth control
it works by thickening the mucus at the opening of the cervix stopping the buildup of the lining of the uterus and occasionally preventing ovulation
the iud with levonorgestrel was first approved for medical use in in finland and in the united states in
it is on the world health organization s list of essential medicines
the hormonal iud is an extremely effective method of birth control and a study demonstrated that it may be used for emergency contraception
in addition to birth control the hormonal iud is used for prevention and treatment of
heavy menstrual periods
endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain
adenomyosis and dysmenorrhea
anemia
endometrial hyperplasia especially in pre menopausal women who wish to maintain fertility in the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia
in some cases use of a hormonal iud may prevent a need for a hysterectomy advantages
considered one of the most effective forms of reversible birth control
can be used while breastfeeding see also nursing mothers
no preparations needed before sex though routine checking of the device strings by patient and physician is advised to ensure proper placement remains intact
of users who wish to become pregnant do so within months of removal
may experience lighter periods some women stop having periods completely see also amenorrhea
effective for up to three to seven years depending on the iud disadvantages
irregular periods and spotting between periods often occurs after insertion this usually improves after three to six months
moderate to severe discomfort may be experienced during insertion procedure including uterine cramping and back pain
other potential adverse effects and risksafter insertion mirena is effective at preventing pregnancy for up to seven years
kyleena is approved for five years and skyla is approved for three years
the hormonal iud is a long acting reversible contraceptive and is considered one of the most effective forms of birth control
the first year failure rate for the hormonal iud is and the five year failure rate is
these rates are comparable to tubal sterilization but unlike sterilization the effects of the hormonal iud are reversible
the hormonal iud is considered to be more effective than other common forms of reversible contraception such as the birth control pill because it requires little action by the user after insertion
the effectiveness of other forms of birth control is mitigated decreased by the users themselves
if medication regimens for contraception are not followed precisely the method becomes less effective
iuds require no daily weekly or monthly regimen so their typical use failure rate is therefore the same as their perfect use failure rate
in women with bicornuate uterus and in need of contraception two iuds are generally applied one in each horn due to lack of evidence of efficacy with only one iud
evidence is lacking regarding progestogen iud usage for menorrhagia in bicornuate uterus but a case report showed good effect with a single iud for this purpose
progestogen only contraceptives such as an iud are not believed to affect milk supply or infant growth
however a study in the mirena application for fda approval found a lower continuation of breastfeeding at days in hormonal iud users versus copper iud users
when using mirena about of the maternal dose of levonorgestrel can be transferred via milk to the
nursed infant
a six year study of breastfed infants whose mothers used a levonorgestrel only method of birth control found the infants had increased risk of respiratory infections and eye infections though a lower risk of neurological conditions compared to infants whose mothers used a copper iud
no longer term studies have been performed to assess the long term effects on infants of levonorgestrel in breast milk
there are conflicting recommendations about use of mirena while breastfeeding
the u s
cdc does not recommend any hormonal method as a first choice of contraceptive for nursing mothers although progestin only methods such as mirena may be used with close follow up or when the benefits outweigh the risks
the world health organization recommends against immediate postpartum insertion citing increased expulsion rates
it also reports concerns about potential effects on the infant s liver and brain development in the first six weeks postpartum
however it recommends offering mirena as a contraceptive option beginning at six weeks postpartum even to nursing women
planned parenthood offers mirena as a contraceptive option for breastfeeding women beginning at four weeks postpartum
a hormonal iud should not be used by women who
are or think they may be pregnant
have abnormal vaginal bleeding that has not been explained controversial
have untreated cervical or uterine cancer
have or may have breast cancer
have abnormalities of the cervix or uterus controversial
have had pelvic inflammatory disease within the past three months
have had an sti such as chlamydia or gonorrhea within the past three months
have liver disease or tumor
have an allergy to levonorgestrel or any of the inactive ingredients included in the deviceinsertion of an iud is acceptable after a dilation and evacuation d e abortion second trimester abortion but may be associated with a higher expulsion rate
to reduce the risk of infection insertion of an iud is not recommended for women that have had a medical abortion but have not yet had an ultrasound to confirm that the abortion was complete or that have not yet had their first menstruation following the medical abortion
a full list of contraindications can be found in the who medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use and the cdc united states medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use
irregular menstrual pattern irregular bleeding and spotting is common in the first three to six months of use
after that time periods become shorter and lighter and of women stop having periods after one year of use
the average user reports days of bleeding or spotting in the first month of use but this diminishes to about four days at months
cramping and pain many women feel discomfort or pain during and immediately after insertion
some women may have cramping for the first weeks after insertion
expulsion sometimes the iud can slip out of the uterus
this is termed expulsion
around of iud users experience expulsion
if this happens a woman is not protected from pregnancy
expulsion is more common in younger women women who have not had children and when an iud is inserted immediately after childbirth or abortion
perforation very rarely the iud can be pushed through the wall of the uterus during insertion
risk of perforation is mostly determined by the skill of the practitioner performing the insertion
for experienced medical practitioners the risk of perforation is one per insertions or less
with postpartum insertions perforation of the uterus is more likely to occur when uterine involution is incomplete involution usually completes by weeks postpartum
special considerations apply to women who plan to breastfeed
if perforation does occur it can damage the internal organs and in some cases surgery is needed to remove the iud
pregnancy complications although the risk of pregnancy with an iud is very small if one does occur there is an increased risk of serious problems
these include ectopic pregnancy infection miscarriage and early labor and delivery
as many as half the pregnancies that occur in mirena users may be ectopic
the incidence rate of ectopic pregnancies is approximately one per users per year
immediate removal of the iud is recommended in the case of pregnancy
no pattern of birth defects was found in the babies for whom birth outcomes were available at the time of fda approval
infection the insertion of the iud does have a small risk of pelvic inflammatory disease pid
concurrent infection with gonorrhea or chlamydia at the time of insertion increases the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease
if pid does occur it will most likely happen within days of insertion
the device itself does not increase the risk of infection
ovarian cysts enlarged follicles ovarian cysts have been diagnosed in about of the subjects using a hormonal iud in studies that use ultrasound to look for cysts even if asymptomatic
in studies that only evaluate symptomatic cysts only of women complain of any ovarian cysts over or more years of use and only require iud removal for ovarian cysts
thus any issues with ovarian cysts are not of a clinically relevant nature
most of these follicles are asymptomatic although some may be accompanied by pelvic pain or dyspareunia
in most cases the enlarged follicles disappear spontaneously after two to three months
surgical intervention is not usually required
mental health changes including nervousness depressed mood mood swings
weight gain
headache migraine
nausea
excessive hairiness
lower abdominal or back pain
decreased libido
itching redness or swelling of the vagina
vaginal discharge
breast pain tenderness
edema
abdominal distension
cervicitis
bacterial vaginosis
may affect glucose tolerance
may experience a change in vision or contact lens tolerance
may deplete vitamin b which can affect energy mood and nervous system functioning
a lost coil occurs when the thread cannot be felt by a woman on routine checking and is not seen on speculum examination
various thread collector devices or simple forceps may then be used to try to grasp the device through the cervix
in the rare cases when this is unsuccessful an ultrasound scan may be arranged to check the position of the coil and exclude its perforation through into the abdominal cavity or its unrecognised previous expulsion according to a evaluation of the studies performed on progestin only birth control by the international agency for research on cancer there is some evidence that progestin only birth control reduces the risk of endometrial cancer
the iarc in concluded that there is no evidence progestin only birth control increases the risk of any cancer though the available studies were too small to be definitively conclusive
progesterone is a hormone in the endometrium that counteracts estrogen driven growth
very low levels of progesterone will cause estrogen to act more leading to endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma
these effects can be minimized if treated with progestin but not in very many cases
estrogen and progesterone have an antagonistic relationship
estrogen promotes the growing of endometrial lining while progesterone limits it
in the case of endometrial cancer progesterone can negatively regulate estrogen driven growth
tumors formed are correlated with insufficient progesterone and excess estrogen
in patients with endometrial cancer who use progestin releasing iuds concluded mixed results
a meta analysis by livia conz et al estimated that users of levonorgestrel releasing systems had an increased breast cancer risk in general with an odds ratio of and higher risk for those over age odds ratio and suggested balancing this risk against the known benefits of long term use
researchers cautioned against causal interpretation from this study citing confounding effects methodological concerns and a meta analysis of randomized controlled trials which showed no increased risk
no evidence has been identified to suggest mirena affects bone mineral density bmd
two small studies limited to studying bmd in the forearm show no decrease in bmd
one of the studies showed at seven years of use similar bmd at the midshaft of the ulna and at the distal radius as nonusers matched by age and bmi
in addition bmd measurements were similar to the expected values for women in the same age group as the participants
the authors of the study said their results were predictable since it is well established that the main factor responsible for bone loss in women is hypoestrogenism and in agreement with previous reports they found estradiol levels in mirena users to be normal
the hormonal iud is a small t shaped piece of plastic which contains levonorgestrel a type of progestin
the cylinder of the device is coated with a membrane that regulates the release of the drug
bayer markets skyla as jaydess in the united kingdom
jaydess releases six micrograms per day and lasts for three years
in comparison oral contraceptives can contain micrograms of levonorgestrel
the hormonal iud releases the levonorgestrel directly into the uterus as such its effects are mostly paracrine rather than systemic
most of the drug stays inside the uterus and only a small amount is absorbed into the rest of the body
the hormonal iud is inserted in a similar procedure to the nonhormonal copper iud and can only be inserted by a qualified medical practitioner
before insertion a pelvic exam is performed to examine the shape and position of the uterus
a current sti at the time of insertion can increase the risk of pelvic infection
however routine screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia prior to insertion is not recommended
if a person needs screening and there is no evidence of infection on examination or has been previously screened insertion of the iud does not need to be delayed
during the insertion the vagina is held open with a speculum the same device used during a pap smear
a grasping instrument is used to steady the cervix the length of the uterus is measured for proper insertion with a uterine sound for decreasing chance of uterine perforation with the iud and the iud is placed using a narrow tube through the opening of the cervix into the uterus
a short length of monofilament plastic nylon string hangs down from the cervix into the vagina
the string allows physicians and patients to check to ensure the iud is still in place and enables easy removal of the device
mild to moderate cramping can occur during the procedure which generally takes five minutes or less
insertion can be performed immediately postpartum and post abortion if no infection has occurred
misoprostol is not effective in reducing pain in iud insertion
removal of the device should also be performed by a qualified medical practitioner
after removal fertility will return to previous levels relatively quickly
one study found that the majority of participants returned to fertility within three months
levonorgestrel is a progestogen i e
progesterone receptor agonist
the hormonal iud s primary mechanism of action is to prevent fertilization
the levonorgestrel intrauterine system has several contraceptive effects although thickening of the cervical mucus appears to be the primary effect
other effects include making the inside of the uterus become fatal to sperm and thinning of the endometrial lining but this is not the usual function
ovulation is not inhibited in all cases
numerous studies have demonstrated that iuds primarily prevent fertilization not implantation
in one experiment involving tubal flushing fertilized eggs were found in half of women not using contraception but no fertilized eggs were found in women using iuds
iuds also decrease the risk of ectopic pregnancy which further implies that iuds prevent fertilization
hormonal iuds were developed in the s following the development of the copper iud in the s and s
antonio scommenga working at the michael reese hospital in chicago discovered that administering progesterone inside the uterus could have contraceptive benefits
with knowledge of scommegna s work a finnish doctor jouni valter tapani luukkainen created the t shaped iud that released progesterone marketed as the progestasert system in
this iud had a short year lifespan and never achieved widespread popularity
following this relative lack of success dr
luukkainen replaced the progesterone with the hormone levonorgestrel to be released over a five year period creating what is now mirena
the mirena iud was studied for safety and efficacy in two clinical trials in finland and sweden involving women who were all between and years of age at the beginning of the trials
the trials included predominantly caucasian women who had been previously pregnant with no history of ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease within the previous year
over of the participants had previously used iuds
in skyla a lower dose levonorgestrel iud effective for up to three years was approved by the fda
skyla has a different bleeding pattern than mirena with only of women in clinical trials becoming amenorrheic compared to approximately with mirena
the city of finland turku is currently the only production site for the mirena contraceptive family
in bayer the maker of mirena was issued an fda warning letter by the united states food and drug administration for overstating the efficacy minimizing the risks of use and making false or misleading presentations about the device
from to the federal agency received over complaints about the device and related adverse effects
as of april over lawsuits have been filed in the united states
