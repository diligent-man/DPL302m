Jean Paul German pa l listen born Johann Paul Friedrich Richter March November was a German Romantic writer best known for his humorous novels and stories
Jean Paul was born at Wunsiedel in the Fichtelgebirge mountains Franconia His father was an organist at Wunsiedel In his father became a pastor at Joditz near Hof and in at Schwarzenbach but he died on April leaving the family in great poverty Later in life Jean Paul noted The words that a father speaks to his children in the privacy of home are not heard by the world but as in whispering galleries they are clearly heard at the end and by posterity After attending the Gymnasium at Hof in Jean Paul went to the University of Leipzig His original intention was to enter his father's profession but theology did not interest him and he soon devoted himself wholly to the study of literature Unable to maintain himself at Leipzig he returned in to Hof where he lived with his mother From to he served as a tutor at T pen a village near Hof and from to he taught the children of several families in a school he had founded in nearby Schwarzenbach
Jean Paul began his career as a man of letters with Gr nl ndische Prozesse Greenland Lawsuits published anonymously in Berlin in and Auswahl aus des Teufels Papieren Selections from the Devil's Papers signed J P F Hasus published in These works were not received with much favour and in later life even their author had little sympathy for their satirical tone
Jean Paul's outlook was profoundly altered by a spiritual crisis he suffered on November in which he had a vision of his own death His next book Die unsichtbare Loge The Invisible Lodge a romance published in under the pen name Jean Paul in honour of Jean Jacques Rousseau had all the qualities that were soon to make him famous and its power was immediately recognized by some of the best critics of the day
Encouraged by the reception of Die unsichtbare Loge Richter composed a number of books in rapid succession Leben des vergn gten Schulmeisterleins Maria Wutz in Auenthal Life of the Cheerful Schoolmaster Maria Wutz the best selling Hesperus which made him famous Biographische Belustigungen unter der Gehirnschale einer Riesin Biographical Recreations under the Brainpan of a Giantess Leben des Quintus Fixlein Life of Quintus Fixlein Der Jubelsenior The Parson in Jubilee and Das Kampaner Tal The Valley of Campan Also among these was the novel Siebenk s in
Siebenk s' slightly supernatural theme involving a Doppelg nger and pseudocide stirred some controversy over its interpretation of the Resurrection but these criticisms served only to draw awareness to the author This series of writings assured Richter a place in German literature and during the rest of his life every work he produced was welcomed by a wide circle of admirers
After his mother's death in Richter went to Leipzig and in the following year to Weimar where he started work on his most ambitious novel Titan published between and Richter became friends with such Weimar notables as Johann Gottfried Herder by whom he was warmly appreciated but despite their close proximity Richter never became close to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe or Friedrich Schiller both of whom found his literary methods repugnant but in Weimar as elsewhere his remarkable conversational powers and his genial manners made him a favorite in general society The British writers Thomas Carlyle and Thomas De Quincey took an interest in Jean Paul's work
In he married Caroline Meyer whom he had met in Berlin the year before They lived first at Meiningen then at Coburg and finally in they settled at Bayreuth Here Richter spent a quiet simple and happy life constantly occupied with his work as a writer In he was delivered from anxiety about outward necessities by Prince Primate Karl Theodor von Dalberg who gave him an annual pension of florins which was later continued by the king of Bavaria
Jean Paul's Titan was followed by Flegeljahre The Awkward Age His later imaginative works were Dr Katzenbergers Badereise Dr Katzenberger's Trip to the Medicinal Springs Des Feldpredigers Schmelzle Reise nach Fl tz Army Chaplain Schmelzle's Voyage to Fl tz Leben Fibels Life of Fibel and Der Komet oder Nikolaus Marggraf The Comet or Nikolaus Markgraf In Vorschule der Aesthetik Introduction to Aesthetics he expounded his ideas on art he discussed the principles of education in Levana oder Erziehungslehre Levana or Pedagogy and the opinions suggested by current events he set forth in Friedenspredigt Peace Sermon D mmerungen f r Deutschland Twilights for Germany Mars und Ph bus Thronwechsel im Jahre Mars and Phoebus Exchange Thrones in the Year and Politische Fastenpredigten Political Lenten Sermons In his last years he began Wahrheit aus Jean Pauls Leben The Truth from Jean Paul's Life to which additions from his papers and other sources were made after his death by C Otto and E F rster
Also during this time he supported the younger writer E T A Hoffmann who long counted Richter among his influences Richter wrote the preface to Fantasy Pieces a collection of Hoffmann's short stories published in
In September Jean Paul lost his only son Max a youth of the highest promise and he never quite recovered from this shock He lost his sight in and died of dropsy at Bayreuth on November
Jean Paul occupies an unusual position in German literature and has always divided the literary public Some hold him in highest veneration while others treat his work with indifference He took the Romantic formlessness of the novel to extremes Schlegel called his novels soliloquies in which he makes his readers take part in this respect going even further than Laurence Sterne in Tristram Shandy Jean Paul habitually played with a multitude of droll and bizarre ideas his work is characterized by wild metaphors as well as by digressive and partly labyrinthine plots He mixed contemplation with literary theory alongside spirited irony the reader finds bitter satire and mild humour next to soberly realistic passages there are romanticized and often ironically curtailed idylls social commentary and political statements The quick changes of mood attracted the composer Schumann whose Papillons was inspired by Jean Paul
His novels were especially admired by women This was due to the empathy with which Jean Paul created the female characters in his works never before in German literature were women represented with such psychological depth At the same time however his work contains misogynistic quips Jean Paul's character may have been as diverse and as confusing as many of his novels he was said to be very sociable and witty while at the same time extremely sentimental having an almost childlike nature quickly moved to tears It is obvious from his works that his interests encompassed not only literature but also astronomy and other sciences
It is no surprise that the relationship of so capricious an author with the Weimar classicists Goethe and Schiller always remained ambivalent Schiller once remarked that Jean Paul was as alien to him as someone who fell from the moon and that he might have been worthy of admiration if he had made as good use of his riches as other men made of their poverty Herder and Wieland on the other hand fully appreciated his work and supported him Although he always kept his distance from the classicists who wanted to absolutize art and although his theoretical approach most notably in his Introduction to Aesthetics was considerably influenced by Romanticism it would be misleading to call him a Romantic without qualification Here too he kept his distance with all his subjectivism he didn't absolutize the subject of the author as the Romantics often did Jean Paul had what had become rare amidst classical severity and romantic irony humour He also was one of the first who approached humour from a theoretical standpoint
He thought that both the Enlightenment and metaphysics had failed though they still held importance for his worldview He arrived at a philosophy without illusions and a state of humorous resignation Correspondingly he was one of the first defenders of Schopenhauer's philosophy He didn't try to indoctrinate but to portray human happiness even and especially in an increasingly alienated environment the rococo castles and bleak villages of Upper Franconia Jean Paul was not only the first to use and name the literary motif of the Doppelg nger he also utilised it in countless variations e g Siebenk s and Leibgeber Liane and Idoine Roquairol and Albano In his novel Siebenk s he defines the Doppelg nger as the people who see themselves
Jean Paul was a lifelong defender of freedom of the press and his campaigns against censorship went beyond many of his contemporaries In his Freiheitsb chlein he maintains that books belong to humanity and should have the chance to have an impact on all times not just the present moment and therefore preventing a book from being published renders the censor a judge not just for contemporary society but for all future societies Censorship is not feasible because it would be impossible to find a person able to fulfill the true requirements of the office After the great achievements of the eighteenth century the prospect of complete freedom of opinion speech and printing was real Even under the tightened conditions of the Napoleonic occupation Jean Paul continued to speak out in favor of reason as in his Friedens Predigt an Deutschland The last section of his Politische Fastenpredigten contains a warning to rulers that minds cannot be controlled and that police action will only cause them to eventually explode like a champagne bottle
Rudolf Steiner edited a multi volume collection of the works of Jean Paul In published lectures Steiner often mentioned the realization by the year old Jean Paul that he was an individual Ego expressed in Paul's surprise at understanding that I am an I
