in the early th century while the rest of the world was engulfed in the depths of world war i the u s
was looking to its south
mexico had been embroiled in a civil war since and in the violence spilt north over the border when pancho villa raided columbus new mexico killing americans
this culminated with a u s
response officially known as the mexican expedition led by major general john pershing
a large number chinese mexicans assisted u s
forces in mexico during the expedition and upon its completion in early they were threatened with hanging by villa

several thousand chinese japanese korean vietnamese and filipinos eventually served in the u s
military during world war i
many asian american military veterans were allowed to become naturalized citizens
for instance some filipino participants were allowed to become naturalized citizens
but others had to overcome numerous legal obstacles
for example although many japanese aliens in america volunteered during world war i under the belief that they would be eligible for naturalization japanese immigrant veterans in hawaii who were initially allowed to be naturalized in had their citizenship rescinded in
notably hidemitsu toyota who had served in the us army for seven years had his petition for naturalization brought before the us supreme court but in the court ruled in hidemitsu toyota v
united states that that a person of the japanese race may not be naturalized
it was not until with the passage of the nye lea act that the japanese immigrant veterans who had had their citizenship revoked along with other asian immigrants were successfully naturalized
another example cesario agudo buensuceso a filipino american who resided in chicago after the war initially attempted to naturalize after serving during world war i but was denied in it was not until after world war ii that he was able to naturalize

these restrictions did not extend to the insular force which was limited to individuals from guam or the philippines

following the japanese attack on pearl harbor in december the u s

civilians
asian americans from oahu including japanese americans assisted with aid efforts following the attack
on the other side of the pacific ocean philippine commonwealth forces under u s
command since july prepared for an attack that would come nine hours later
following the attack on pearl harbor japanese americans in the hawaii national guard activated and began to guard the beaches clear rubble donate blood and aid the wounded but three days later they were disarmed because of their ancestry
the next day however they were authorized to rearm but an uneasy tension lasted until june
at the same time japanese americans who had been undertaking the rotc program at the university of hawaii and who had been activated in the hawaii territorial guard were discharged on january
many of these discharged soldiers formed a corps of engineers auxiliary known as the varsity victory volunteers in february
on june nisei of the hawaii national guard shipped out from hawaii bound for oakland and on june after docking they were formed into the th infantry battalion
afterwards all japanese american men not already in the military were classified as enemy aliens this policy was reversed in
eight months later the decision was made to raise an all nisei regiment known as the nd regimental combat team
progress was slow at first and another four months passed before the nd began training two months after that though the th shipped out to europe
initially the notion of employing japanese american soldiers was rejected by general dwight d
eisenhower s staff at the supreme headquarters allied expeditionary force but they were eventually accepted by lieutenant general mark clark s fifth army
while the nd was training in the u s the th sustained heavy losses eventually earning the title the purple heart battalion on june two weeks after the nd arrived in europe the two nisei units combined to form one single unit but those who had been a part of the th wanted to keep their numerical designation so they replaced the regiment s st battalion
keeping with the policy at the time the unit was segregated and large number of the other members of the nd rct were previously interned japanese americans from the continental united states commanded by mostly white officers
the combat chronicle of the regiment became a highly storied one resulting in it becoming one of the most decorated units in the european theater taking part in numerous actions in italy france and germany including the liberation of dachau concentration camp
the nd regiment was the most decorated unit for its size and length of service in the history of american warfare
the men who initially made up the unit in april had to be replaced nearly times
in total about men served earning purple hearts
the unit was awarded eight presidential unit citations five earned in one month
additionally japanese americans also contributed to the war effort in the pacific front serving in the military intelligence service helping with the decoding of japanese intelligence and the rebuilding of occupied japan the first asian american women to enter the u s

one of those was presented to hawai i senator and former captain daniel k
inouye
on october congress created the congressional gold medal recognizing the nd regimental combat team and the th infantry battalion as well as the japanese americans who served in the military intelligence service during the war
it has been estimated that between and chinese american men representing up to percent of the men in their portion of the u s
population served during world war ii
of those serving about percent were not citizens and unlike japanese and filipino americans percent served in non segregated units
chinese americans distinguished themselves from japanese americans and suffered less discrimination
a quarter of those would serve in the u s
army air forces some of which were sent to the chinese burma india theater for service with the th air service group and the chinese american composite wing
another percent would go on to serve in the u s
army in various units including the rd th th nd and th infantry divisions
prior to the war the u s
navy had recruited chinese americans but they had been restricted to serve only as stewards this continued until may when restrictions ceased and they were allowed to serve in other ratings
in chinese american women were accepted into the women s army corps in the military intelligence service
they were also recruited for service in the army air force with a few later becoming civilian women airforce service pilots

a smaller force held out at fort mills however after an assault lieutenant general jonathan wainwright surrendered the usaffe forces that remained in the philippines in may
of those who surrendered were filipino officers who had graduated from west point japanese forces executed six of these filipino prisoners of war including vicente lim who had by then reached the rank of brigadier general
in the u s filipinos were initially blocked from enlisting until the laws were revised a day before japan had begun its invasion back in the philippines
of the filipinos who lived in california two fifths or sixteen thousand filipinos attempted to enlist into the u s
some would serve in non segregated units yet a segregated infantry battalion was established which continued to grow and at its peak was split into two units known as the st and nd filipino infantry regiments
these soldiers were subjected to discrimination during their time training at camp beale and fort ord sometimes being mistaken for japanese americans when off base
nevertheless these units would serve with distinction similar to that of the d infantry regiment although their deeds were not as well documented or widely known
by the end of the war a total of decorations awards medals ribbons certificates commendations and citations had been awarded to personnel assigned to these two regiments for their service in the new guinea and philippines campaigns
back in the philippines some individual service members and units refused to heed orders to surrender
they began a guerilla campaign to resist the japanese occupation and were later joined by paroled filipino usaffe soldiers as well as filipino civilians and other allied forces that had been inserted into the islands
allied forces returned to the philippines in significant numbers during the battle of leyte
these included the filipino infantry units which had been reduced in size from their peak
later that year the philippine division was reconstituted and in those members who elected to remain in the philippines at the end of the war were transferred to the pc aus

of the who died during the korean war were asian americans
one asian american received the medal of honor for actions during the korean war
