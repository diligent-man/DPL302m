The process of transformation of MRTV in a public service broadcaster is not yet completed it entailed the Law on Broadcasting Activities and the Broadcast Law Editorial independence of MRTV is guaranteed by law but de facto lacking due to lack of independent funding and lack of independence of MRTV managerial bodies MRTV executive directors in the last ten years remained close to the party in power The network is funded by a license fee as well as by public budget contributions and advertising revenues limited to of airtime Budgetary needs and the practice of ad hoc state budgetary funding has created a culture of dependence in MRTV
MRTV is supervised by the MRTV Council whose members are appointed by the Parliament upon proposal by authorised nominators from civil society The Council then elects the members of MRTV Management Board Although formally only accountable to the legislature through its annual report and budget plan MRTV remains informally accountable to the executive undermining institutional autonomy MRTV also risks neglecting cultural pluralism obligations in terms of programmes for minorities as well as lacking impartiality and distance from government majority politicians
