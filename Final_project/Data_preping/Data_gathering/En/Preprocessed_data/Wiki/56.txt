The 12-3 incident (Chinese: 一二·三事件; Portuguese: Motim 1-2-3) refers to political demonstrations and rioting against Portuguese rule in Macau that occurred on 3 December 1966
The incident, inspired by the Cultural Revolution in the People's Republic of China, occurred in direct response to a violent police crackdown by the Portuguese colonial authorities against local Chinese protestors demonstrating against corruption and colonialism in Macau
The incident is known as "12-3", in reference to the date of the riots.
Pressured by business leaders in Macau and the mainland Chinese government, the colonial government agreed to meet the demands of the protestors and apologized for the police crackdown
Portuguese sovereignty over Macau became severely diminished after the incident, leading to de facto Chinese suzerainty over the territory 33 years prior to the eventual official transfer of sovereignty.
The Portuguese occupation of Macau is broadly divided into three different political periods
The first, being the establishment of the first Portuguese settlement in Macau from 1557 until 1849
During this period the settlement administrators only had jurisdiction over the Portuguese community
The second period, known as the colonial period, scholars generally place from 1849 to 1974
It was in this period the Portuguese colonial administration began to take an active role in the lives of both the Portuguese and ethnic Chinese communities in Macau.
On 26 March 1887, the Lisbon Protocol was signed, in which China recognized the "perpetual occupation and government of Macau" by Portugal who in turn, agreed never to surrender Macau to a third party without the consent of the Chinese government
This was reaffirmed in the Treaty of Peking on 1 December 1887
Throughout the colonial administration of Macau, development of Portuguese Macau stagnated due to a complex colonial bureaucracy and corruption
Racial segregation and division also existed throughout society
Within the governance of Macau, almost all government officers and civil service positions were held by local Portuguese residents.
In September 1945, Republic of China Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressed to the Portuguese government a desire to transfer Macau back to Chinese control
However, due to the Chinese Civil War, discussions related between the Kuomintang and the Portuguese were postponed indefinitely
In 1949, with the founding of the People's Republic of China a large number of refugees and Kuomintang supporters fled China to Portuguese Macau.
Before the 12-3 incident, the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party parties both maintained a presence in Macau
With the founding of the People's Republic, the colonial Portuguese government opened unofficial relations with the People's Republic of China in contrast to the Republic of China due to its direct proximity of Macau with a land border
Following the founding of the PRC, the influence of the communists grew substantially in Macau especially among business leaders throughout the region, while it decreased with the nationalists.
Schools and education in Macau were divided on racial lines, with the Portuguese and Macanese sending their children to fully subsidized private schools while the Chinese population had to send their children to either Catholic or Communist schools
The segregation of education in Macau was an area of great contention for the local populations
In 1966, residents of Taipa Island, sponsored by the Chinese communists, tried to obtain permission to build a private school
Despite being granted a plot of land by the Portuguese authorities, Portuguese officials delayed the processing of the building permits, as they had not received any bribes from the residents of Taipa Island
In spite of receiving no building permits from the local administration, local residents began construction of the private school.
On 15 November 1966, Urban Services Officers on Taipa blocked further construction of the school, leading to a confrontation between Chinese protesters and Macau Police
The police, including plain-clothes officers, injured over 40 people, of whom 14 were later detained.
In response, a group of around 60 Chinese students and workers demonstrated outside the Governor's Palace in support of the residents of Taipa Island
The demonstrators shouted revolutionary slogans and read aloud from Mao Zedong's Little Red Book
On 3 December 1966, demonstrators began to riot and denounced Portuguese authorities for "fascist atrocities"
Protestors, instigated by local communists and pro-Beijing business owners, ransacked Portuguese institutions throughout Macau such as the Macau City Hall and Public Notary's Office
Violence was also directed towards local Chinese businesses and organizations loyal to the Republic of China government now located in Taipei
Unlike in neighboring Hong Kong – which faced similar leftist riots – the business community largely did not back the colonial government.
In Mainland China, specifically in Guangdong, Red Guards, inspired by the Cultural Revolution and angered by the violence towards Chinese in Macau, began to protest in large numbers at the mainland China–Macau border.
On 3 December, the colonial government ordered the rioters and demonstrators to be arrested, leading to even more mass discontent and popular support for opposition to the Portuguese administration
In response, demonstrators toppled the statue of Colonel Vicente Nicolau de Mesquita at Largo do Senado, the city center, and also tore off the right arm of a statue of Jorge Álvares located on the former outer harbor ferry port
At the Leal Senado or city hall, portraits of former governors were torn off the walls, and books and city records were tossed into the street and set on fire
Consequently, martial law was declared, authorizing a Portuguese military garrison and police to crack down on the protests
As a result, 8 people were killed by police and 212 were injured.
In response to the crackdown, the Portuguese government immediately implemented a news blockade, Portuguese-language newspapers and magazines were banned, and newspapers in Portugal and overseas provinces were ordered to censor reports about the incident
In response to the incident, the Chinese government deployed the People's Liberation Army to the Chinese-Portuguese Macau border to prevent Red Guards from invading Macau
Four Chinese warships also entered the waters of Macau in response to the crackdown.
The security ring set around Macau by the Chinese would be involved in multiple casualty-causing conflicts with Red Guards attempting to invade Macau by both land and by sea
The pro-Beijing community in Macau adopted a "Three No's" approach as a means to continue their struggle with the Government — no taxes, no service, no selling to the Portuguese
Representing Chinese Macau was the pro-Beijing Struggle Committee against Portuguese Persecution, known locally as the Committee of Thirteen
Chairman of the Committee was Leong Pui, the leader of the pro-Beijing Macau General Association of Labour.
Negotiations to resolve and prevent further escalation between the People's Republic of China, Committee of Thirteen, and the Portuguese government took place in Guangdong
The chief negotiator for the Chinese was Ho Yin, whose involvement and commitment to resolve the crisis caused by the riot was crucial because at that time he was the only one who could contact directly both the Portuguese administration and Chinese officials in Guangzhou and Beijing, as he was the representative of Macau in the Legislative Council.
The Portuguese, due to increasing pressures from both Beijing and Lisbon, agreed to sign agreements with the Committee of Thirteen and the Guangdong Government Foreign Affairs Bureau, along with an official statement of apology, and accepted responsibility for the events on 3 December 1966
On 29 January 1967, the Portuguese Governor, José Manuel de Sousa e Faro Nobre de Carvalho, with the endorsement of Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar, signed a statement of apology at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, under a portrait of Mao Zedong, with Ho, as the Chamber's President, presiding.
Alongside the apology, the Portuguese agreed to reinforce the role of the Macau Chinese business elite in running the governmental affairs of Macau, promised to never use force against the Chinese community of Macau, and agreed to pay reparations to the Chinese community in Macau to the sum of 2 million Macanese pataca as compensation for the eight dead and 212 injured
In contrast, the agreement signed with the Guangdong government was more favorable to the Portuguese; per the agreement, the Chinese government would take back all refugees who arrived in Macau from 30 January 1967 on wards, a promise China would keep until 1978.
This marked the beginning of equal treatment and recognition of Chinese identity in Macau and the beginning of de facto Chinese control of the territory with Chinese Communist Ho Yin becoming the de facto governor of Macau
The Portuguese Foreign Minister, Alberto Franco Nogueira, described Portugal's role in Macau after 1967 as "a caretaker of a condominium under foreign supervision"
Chinese media described the political situation of Macau as a "half liberated zone"
Shortly after the agreements were signed, Chinese military forces around Macau were withdrawn and the Red Guard threat had subsided.
With the Portuguese now only nominally in control of Macau, political power would increasingly rest with the pro-Beijing trade unions and business leaders
The official Portuguese and Chinese positions about the political status of Macau did not differ, as both now described the region as a Chinese territory under Portuguese administration and not a colony or overseas territory.
As a consequence of Beijing's increasing influence, pro-Kuomintang activities in Macau were banned, and the Republic of China's diplomatic mission was closed
The flying of the flag of the Republic of China was banned, and Kuomintang-run schools were also closed
In addition, refugees from mainland China were either barred from entering or returned to China.
Emboldened by their success against the Portuguese, the Committee of Thirteen encouraged demonstrations against other institutions in Macau that were perceived to be antagonistic towards the People's Republic
Specifically, the British Consulate and the Macau Branch of the Hong Kong Immigration department were once again targeted by protestors
British consular staff in Macau were under constant threat and harassment by Red Guards, leading to the closure of the British consulate in 1967.
On 25 April 1974, a group of left-wing Portuguese officers organized a coup d'état in Portugal, overthrowing the right-wing ruling government that had been in power for 48 years
The new government began to transition Portugal to a democratic system and was committed to decolonization
The new Portuguese government carried out de-colonization policies and proposed Macau's handover to China to occur in 1978
The Chinese government rejected this proposal, believing that an early transfer of Macau would impact relations with Hong Kong.
On 31 December 1975, the Portuguese government withdrew its remaining troops from Macau
On 8 February 1979, the Portuguese government decided to break off diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, and established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China the next day
Both Portugal and the People's Republic of China recognized Macau as Chinese territory
The colony remained under Portuguese rule until 20 December 1999, when it was transferred to China
Ho Yin's son, Edmund Ho Hau Wah, would become the first Chief Executive of the Macau Special Administrative Region following the transfer of sovereignty in 1999.
