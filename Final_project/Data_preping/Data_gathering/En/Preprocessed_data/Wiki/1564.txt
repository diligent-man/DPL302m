church music during the reformation developed during the protestant reformation in two schools of thought the regulative and normative principles of worship based on reformers john calvin and martin luther
they derived their concepts in response to the catholic church music which they found distracting and too ornate
both principles also pursued use of the native tongue either alongside or in place of liturgical latin
the protestant reformation which rapidly spread throughout europe in the sixteenth century created sweeping changes in many facets of society
a call for reform and a subsequent break from the roman church by martin luther and his followers in following the diet of worms created an irreversible schism in the church and while this divide was more immediately noticeable politically the protestant movement changed many aspects of europeans daily lives through the reformed doctrine and practices of the new churches
one of the most noticeable changes to take place was the way in which christians worshiped through music
before and during the reformation much of catholic worship music consisted of highly florid choral works gregorian plainchant and responsive songs in praise of god and in honor of the virgin mary
protestant reformers however sought to change catholicism s perceived dangers of overly theatrical performances the unwarranted expense of elaborate ceremonies and enormous pipe organs and the uselessness of text unintelligible to the common man the urge for reform in these areas created two main schools of thought one which adhered to the regulative principle of worship music and one which followed the normative principle with the latter becoming far more prevalent as time progressed
the dissension between these two groups led to stark contrasts in worship practices
the normative principle provides an elastic interpretation to the bible and god s intention about worship music claiming what the scripture forbids not it allows and what it allows is not unlawful and what is not unlawful may lawfully be done this doctrine gave its followers great artistic and creative freedom in organizing worship services and composing hymns
normative principlists often incorporated organ and other instruments into church music and were not as stringent as regulative principlists on restricting the combination of various mediums of worship
the most notable follower of the normative principle was martin luther
being a friar luther s life was steeped in the musical traditions of roman chant and he had a deep love for music as a singer lutenist and composer
luther would make use of his musical skills to become a tool for promoting the teaching reforms of the reformation
luther strongly supported worship music and emphasized its importance in the church and was once witnessed remarking
luther s hymns date from to
the earliest lutheran hymnal was the achtliederbuch or first lutheran hymnal of with eight hymns by luther and by paul speratus
luther wrote hymns which survive today though he perhaps wrote additional texts which were passed around informally
well known of luther s hymns and still in use are nun komm der heiden heiland savior of the nations come vom himmel hoch da komm ich her from heaven above to earth i come christ lag in todesbanden christ jesus lay in death s strong bands komm heiliger geist herre gott come holy ghost god and lord wir glauben all an einen gott we all believe in one true god mit fried und freud ich fahr dahin in peace and joy i now depart ein feste burg ist unser gott a mighty fortress is our god erhalt uns herr bei deinem wort lord keep us steadfast in thy word aus tiefer not schrei ich zu dir out of the depths i cry to thee nun bitten wir den heiligen geist we now implore god the holy ghost and vater unser im himmelreich our father thou in heaven above
these and many of the other hymns by luther would constitute the base of many chorale based compositions by sch tz bach brahms and others
luther built on traditional hymns in words and melodies latin chants german songs secular and sacred folk songs and hymns from the bohemian community
claims that some of luther s hymns were based on bar tunes or drinking songs perhaps expounded from the use of popular tunes in his hymns and from later musical terminology that referred to many of these hymns as being in bar form
however there is no evidence that actual drinking songs were used as hymn tunes
in addition to hymns luther also composed german liturgical chants used in the deutsche messe german mass of as well as chant settings for various canticles litanies and a motet
luther s most notable musical legacy is his development of hymnody in the vernacular german language
his intent was to include the laity in the liturgy although the development of congregational singing among lutherans was to be an uneven and gradual process over the next three centuries
involving the laity with singing hymns was a teaching tool
some hymns were modeled after sections of luther s small catechism such as vater unser im himmelreich which was based on the lord s prayer
the hymns could by sung unaccompanied but organs and choir supported congregational singing where such resources were available
organ music would play a large role in lutheran music later on
luther said that music ought to be accorded the greatest honour and a place next to theology due to its great importance
during the reformation luther did much to encourage the composition and publication of hymns and wrote numerous worship songs in german
in keeping with the normative principle luther popularized the use of songs inspired by scripture as opposed to calvinist metered or even word for word recitations of the psalms and other biblical texts
for example luther s widely popular hymn ein feste burg ist unser gott while based on psalm contains language not directly taken from scripture
this combination of biblical language with composers additions and basic ornamentation in lutheran hymns allowed luther and his followers to include emotional musical phrasing which appealed to a broader audience
however luther s approval of textual elaboration and musical complexities in chorales did not mean that he completely disregarded protestant orthodoxies
while luther supported the use of polyphony he still made it clear that he regarded the main purpose of hymns as teaching the populace about scripture and worshiping god
one reason for luther s adoption of the normative principle and his application of it with his own church music was to more effectively disseminate his ideas particularly to other german speaking areas
luther s hymns were primarily written in the vernacular and consisted of universal themes such as hope peace and grace which transcended socioeconomic boundaries
luther also increased the popularity of his songs by setting religious text and his own improvised lyrics to secular folk tunes known well throughout german provinces
luther even penned hymns which touched on political issues and promoted the reformation
in his zeitungslied newspaper song ein neues lied wir heben an a new song here shall be begun luther condemned the burning of jan van essen and hendrik vos two young augustinian canons active in the reformation
he commended their faith and witness to the gospel while and censuring their condemnation
these qualities made luther s works well received across germany and many were soon translated into other languages
ein feste burg ist unser gott a mighty fortress is our god in particular has since been translated into languages
many protestant reformers drawing from the bible and the concept of sola scriptura latin for by scripture alone argued that worship music ought to be derived directly from the book of psalms in the old testament
this concept came to be known as the regulative principle
its adherents asserted that worship is by divine warrant noun warrant and that god intended mankind to worship him through scripture only since the bible serves as god s revelation to man on how he is to be worshiped
for instance in the heidelberg catechism the author german reformed theologian zacharias ursinus states q
what does god require in the second commandment a
we are not to make an image of god in any way nor to worship him in any other manner than he has commanded in his word followers of the regulative principle vehemently opposed worship music containing text not from scripture verbatim and thus their worship services contained only hymns arranged from the psalms hence the term psalmody
regulative principlists were often firm and intransigent in their beliefs as is seen in the belgic confession where the author decrees the whole manner of worship which god requires of us is written in it the bible at length
it is therefore unlawful for any one sic even for an apostle to teach otherwise than we are now taught in holy scripture yes even if it be an angel from heaven as the apostle paul says
there were many prominent theologians and church leaders during the reformation who adhered to the regulative principle
on one extreme huldrych zwingli a swiss priest rejected all forms of music within worship
he removed all art works from the church
and destroyed organs and other musical instruments because according to him they promoted self indulgence however most regulative principle advocates still promoted the use of worship music in the church only in the sense that only scripture could be used in songs
john calvin was a regulative principle supporter who encouraged worship music
a frenchman calvin studied civil law in paris and orl ans but was soon pressured to leave france due to heavy opposition to his protestant sympathies
he eventually relocated to geneva where he further synthesized his doctrine and continued to aid the reform movement especially through his theological dissertations
calvin s attitude towards music in the church was complex
like all who followed the regulative principle he was extremely cautious about how worship music was utilized because he believed god laid out very specific directions in the bible on how one could worship
for example calvin initially allowed the use of instruments in worship music but advocate ed a careful and skillful use of them
in fact he later banned instruments from being used in his congregation claiming that they were too strongly tied to antiquated and unorthodox methods from before the reformation
calvin also asserted that there could be no worship of god without the proper preaching of the word in selecting hymns for church services calvin avoided anything that may have invited sensuality and self gratification to this effect many of the songs which received his approval were simple in nature and lacked the melodic and harmonic complexities of many catholic masses
they were sung syllabically and the melodies moved primarily by conjunct motion avoiding large and uncomfortable intervals
one element which calvin added to worship music was children s choirs
calvin was deeply concerned for the piety and religious devotion of parishioners and posited that children could teach adults simplicity childlike devotion and a sincere heart when singing even though there might be problems with intonation and the like while many protestants including followers of martin luther objected to calvin s rather staunch approach to music calvin did much to develop a new form of music separate from hundreds of years of catholic doctrine and ritual
his use of the vernacular in the recitation of the psalms made worship music more accessible and comprehensible to the public and his simple melodies and inclusion of children s choirs encouraged congregational participation in worship services
even thomas m ntzer who had introduced a reformatory german language liturgy before luther wrote new hymns
m ntzer relied mainly on well known gregorian melodies which he translated into german
some of his songs such as his translation of the latin conditor alme siderum can be found today in both catholic and protestant hymnals
in the context of the reformation baptist movement new hymns were created
particularly noteworthy is the first printed in anabaptist hymn book ausbund which was used until the th century in southern german mennonites and even today in the amish in north america
the core of the hymn book was songs whose authorship is unknown save that they were all written between and by baptists in the dungeon of the veste oberhaus castle
they were mostly sung to folk melodies
also popular was das sch n gesangb chlein from which contained songs
known anabaptist songwriters include felix manz one of the co founders of the first baptist church in as well as michael sattler hans hut leonhard schiemer and george blaurock
some churches of anabaptist heritage today still practice the lining out of hymns
during the same time period of that luther and calvin were active on the mainland england too was influenced and experienced its own distinct reformation movement
king henry viii after failing to convince pope clement vii to annul his marriage to catherine of aragon so that he could marry anne boleyn proclaimed himself head of the church of england an action which was officialised in parliament s act of supremacy
after this england s political ties to rome were severed but although the church of england adopted a primarily calvinist theology it still retained many of the ecclesiastical traditions of catholic services to the dismay of the more conservative calvinists
given england s unique situation english protestant music emerged as its own distinct genre during and after the reformation
in some ways it reflected elements of calvinism for instance calvinist psalmodies were exceedingly popular in mid sixteenth century england
however english congregations also utilized materials which would be considered more lutheran in style including broadside ballads which were repurposed for religious use
a particularly common source of worship material in english churches was the second book of common prayer commissioned by the protestant king edward vi in
the english reformation oversaw the proliferation of english protestant composers and the writing of many english psalters musical arrangements of the book of psalms
this was in part due to a reaction against catholic worship music following the english reformation
english protestants particularly denounced catholic music due to the fact that it was performed in a foreign tongue latin which they saw as conflicting with parts of scripture and therefore with the will of god
because of this english clergymen and composers began to form a unique canon of english worship music distinct from that of continental europe
perhaps the most notable early anglican protestant composer was issac watts known as the father of english hymnody
watts broke with the popular calvinist theology of the time by altering his arrangements of the psalms to better reflect christian elements found only in the new testament as is evident by the title of his work the psalms of david imitated in the language of the new testament
another prominent english composer of the time was benjamin keach a minister and leader of the particular baptist denomination
keach is responsible for being the first songwriter to popularize the singing of hymns as opposed to purely psalms in english churches and his song collection titled a feast of fat things became a staple in many english protestant churches
while many english composers experimented with polyphonic chorales and the use of multiple instruments the english crown under the young protestant king edward vi began to tightly restrict these elements during a brief revival of english calvinist regulative theology
however many of these restrictions on church music were lifted with edward vi s premature death and the catholic mary tudor s ascension to the throne in
the outstanding scottish composer of the first half of the sixteenth century was robert carver c
a canon of scone abbey
his complex polyphonic music could only have been performed by a large and highly trained choir such as the one employed in the scottish chapel royal
james v was also a patron to figures including david peebles c
whose best known work si quis diligit me text from john is a motet for four voices
these were probably only two of many accomplished composers from this era whose work has largely only survived in fragments
much of what survives of church music from the first half of the sixteenth century is due to the diligent work of thomas wode d
vicar of st andrews who compiled a part book from now lost sources which was continued by unknown hands after his death
the reformation had a significant impact on church music
the song schools of the abbeys cathedrals and collegiate churches were closed down choirs disbanded music books and manuscripts destroyed and organs removed from churches
the lutheranism that influenced the early scottish reformation attempted to accommodate catholic musical traditions into worship drawing on latin hymns and vernacular songs
the most important product of this tradition in scotland was the gude and godlie ballatis which were spiritual satires on popular ballads composed by the brothers james john and robert wedderburn
never adopted by the kirk they nevertheless remained popular and were reprinted from the s to the s
the calvinism that came to dominate the scottish reformation would seek to replace catholic musical tradition and popular music with metricised versions of the psalms which it considered inherently more biblical
the scottish psalter of was commissioned by the assembly of the church
it drew on the work of french musician cl ment marot calvin s contributions to the strasbourg psalter of and english writers particularly the edition of the psalter produced by william whittingham for the english congregation in geneva
the intention was to produce individual tunes for each psalm but of psalms had proper tunes and in the seventeenth century common tunes which could be used for psalms with the same metre became more frequent in the seventeenth century
because whole congregations would now sing these psalms unlike the trained choirs who had sung the many parts of polyphonic hymns there was a need for simplicity and most church compositions were confined to homophonic settings
during his personal reign james vi attempted to revive the song schools with an act of parliament passed in demanding that councils of the largest burghs set up ane sang scuill with ane maister sufficient and able for insturctioun of the yowth in the said science of musik
five new schools were opened within four years of the act and by there were at least twenty five
most of those without song schools made provision within their grammar schools
polyphony was incorporated into editions of the psalter from but in the few locations where these settings were used the congregation sang the melody and trained singers the contra tenor treble and bass parts
however the triumph of the presbyterians in the national covenant of led to and end of polyphony and a new psalter in common metre but without tunes was published in
in the twelve tunes for the church of scotland composed in four parts which actually contained tunes designed for use with the psalter was first published in aberdeen
it would go through five editions by
by the late seventeenth century these two works had become the basic corpus of the psalmody sung in the kirk
