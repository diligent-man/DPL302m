The Philadelphia Eagles Santa Claus incident one of the most infamous incidents in Philadelphia sports history came at halftime of the final game of the dismal season when the Eagles were on their way to losing to the Minnesota Vikings The Eagles had planned a Christmas pageant for halftime of the December game but the condition of the field was too poor Instead the team asked a fan dressed as Santa Claus to run onto the field to celebrate with a group of cheerleaders The fans in no mood to celebrate loudly booed and threw snowballs at Santa Claus
