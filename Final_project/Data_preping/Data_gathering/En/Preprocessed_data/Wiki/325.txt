The Philadelphia Eagles season was the franchise's th season in the National Football League NFL
They failed to improve on their previous output of winning only two games
They finished but the Buffalo Bills went and got Simpson with the first pick
Before they won their twelfth game which they won the Eagles were on target for a winless season at
They were the first team in the NFL proper to lose eleven consecutive games in one season since their own season though in the AFL the Oakland Raiders lost their first thirteen games
The Philadelphia Eagles Santa Claus incident one of the most infamous incidents in Philadelphia sports history came at halftime of the final game of the dismal season when the Eagles were on their way to losing to the Minnesota Vikings
The Eagles had planned a Christmas pageant for halftime of the December game but the condition of the field was too poor
Instead the team asked a fan dressed as Santa Claus to run onto the field to celebrate with a group of cheerleaders
The fans in no mood to celebrate loudly booed and threw snowballs at Santa Claus
