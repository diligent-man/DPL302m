Yassa alternatively Yasa Yasaq Jazag Zasag Mongolian Их засаг Ikh Zasag iswas the oral law code of the Mongols declared in public in Bukhara by Genghis Khan de facto law of the Mongol Empire even though the law was kept secret and never made public The Yassa seems to have its origin as wartime decrees which were later codified and expanded to include cultural and lifestyle conventions By keeping the Yassa secret the decrees could be modified and used selectively It is believed that the Yassa was supervised by Genghis Khan himself and his stepbrother Shikhikhutag then the high judge in Mongolian улсын их заргач of the Mongol Empire Genghis Khan appointed his second son Chagatai later Chagatai Khan to oversee the laws' execution
The Yasa decrees were thought to be comprehensive and specific but no Mongolian scroll or codex has been found There are records of excerpts among many chronicles including Makrizi Vartan and ibn Batuta Moreover copies may have been discovered in Korea as well The absence of any physical document is historically problematic Historians are left with secondary sources conjecture and speculation which describe much of the content of the overview Historical certainty about the Yassa is weak compared to the much older Code of Hammurabi th century BCE or the Edicts of Ashoka rd century BCE The latter was carved for all to see on stone plinths to m high which were located throughout Ashoka's empire now India Nepal Pakistan and Afghanistan The Yassa which is thought to be written in the Uighaur Mongolian script and written on scrolls was preserved in secret archives and known only to and read only by the royal family Beyond being a code of laws the Yassa may have included philosophical spiritual and mystical elements and so may have been thought of as a quasi sacred or magic text
The exoteric aspect of Yasa outlined laws for various members of the Mongol community such as soldiers officers and doctors The Yassa aimed at three things obedience to Genghis Khan a binding together of the nomad clans and the merciless punishment of wrongdoing It concerned itself with people not property Unless a man actually confessed he was not judged guilty The purpose of many decrees was probably to eliminate social and economic disputes among the Mongols and future allied peoples Among the rules were no stealing of livestock from other people the required sharing food with travelers no abduction of women from other families and no defection among soldiers It represented a day to day set of rules for people under Mongol control that was strictly enforced
The Yasa also addressed and reflected Mongol cultural and lifestyle norms Death via decapitation was the most common punishment unless the offender was of noble blood when the offender would be killed by way of back breaking without shedding blood Even minor offenses were punishable by death For example a soldier would be put to death if he did not pick up something that fell from the person in front of him Those favoured by the Khan were often given preferential treatment within the system of law and were allowed several chances before being punished
As Genghis Khan had set up an institution that ensured complete religious freedom people under his rule were free to worship as they pleased if the laws of the Yassa were observed
Many sources provide conjectures about the actual laws of the Yassa The Yassa was so influential that other cultures appropriated and adapted portions of it or reworked it for ends of negative propaganda For instance the number of offenses for which the death penalty was given was well known by contemporaries However Harold Lamb's Genghis Khan The Emperor of All Men quotes a translation by François Pétis de la Croix Although unable to come upon a complete list of the laws he compiled several from Persian and Arabic chroniclers such as Fras Rubruquis and Giovanni da Pian del Carpine Those laws are listed here

The law required the payment of a bride price Though not mentioned in other sources it may be that it is a dowry reference since the bride price is usually a custom restricted to specific Mongol tribes but that may have appeared later This may have been practiced earlier but Chinggis Khan himself had never followed this custom and it was little if at all referred to in the Nuvs Tobchaan Mongolyn The bride price might have been considered as a useful deterrent to trade in women or simply a modernising experimental inversion from a dowry but the Tatars' neighbours traded in women which was prohibited as was reported by the Yassa and that marriage between the first and second degrees of kinship is forbidden A man may marry two sisters or have several concubines but under Buddhism and shamanism there was a progressive tendency for a marriage ceremony Some Buddhist forms revived some casualty without marriage The women should attend to the care of property buying and selling at their pleasure in another version Os Mongóis by a Portuguese publisher of summarised histories of culture the law is quoted as defining trade as their sphere There is no exclusion from military participation but it was reported more popular among Tatars as according to Islamic law which was possible to follow only via Sufiism Men should occupy themselves only with hunting and war
