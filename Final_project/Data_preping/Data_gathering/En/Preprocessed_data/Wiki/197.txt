yassa alternatively yasa yasaq jazag zasag mongolian ikh zasag is was the oral law code of the mongols declared in public in bukhara by genghis khan de facto law of the mongol empire even though the law was kept secret and never made public
the yassa seems to have its origin as wartime decrees which were later codified and expanded to include cultural and lifestyle conventions
by keeping the yassa secret the decrees could be modified and used selectively
it is believed that the yassa was supervised by genghis khan himself and his stepbrother shikhikhutag then the high judge in mongolian of the mongol empire
genghis khan appointed his second son chagatai later chagatai khan to oversee the laws execution
the yasa decrees were thought to be comprehensive and specific but no mongolian scroll or codex has been found
there are records of excerpts among many chronicles including makrizi vartan and ibn batuta
moreover copies may have been discovered in korea as well
the absence of any physical document is historically problematic
historians are left with secondary sources conjecture and speculation which describe much of the content of the overview
historical certainty about the yassa is weak compared to the much older code of hammurabi th century bce or the edicts of ashoka rd century bce
the latter was carved for all to see on stone plinths to m high which were located throughout ashoka s empire now india nepal pakistan and afghanistan
the yassa which is thought to be written in the uighaur mongolian script and written on scrolls was preserved in secret archives and known only to and read only by the royal family
beyond being a code of laws the yassa may have included philosophical spiritual and mystical elements and so may have been thought of as a quasi sacred or magic text
the exoteric aspect of yasa outlined laws for various members of the mongol community such as soldiers officers and doctors
the yassa aimed at three things obedience to genghis khan a binding together of the nomad clans and the merciless punishment of wrongdoing
it concerned itself with people not property
unless a man actually confessed he was not judged guilty
the purpose of many decrees was probably to eliminate social and economic disputes among the mongols and future allied peoples
among the rules were no stealing of livestock from other people the required sharing food with travelers no abduction of women from other families and no defection among soldiers
it represented a day to day set of rules for people under mongol control that was strictly enforced
the yasa also addressed and reflected mongol cultural and lifestyle norms
death via decapitation was the most common punishment unless the offender was of noble blood when the offender would be killed by way of back breaking without shedding blood
even minor offenses were punishable by death
for example a soldier would be put to death if he did not pick up something that fell from the person in front of him
those favoured by the khan were often given preferential treatment within the system of law and were allowed several chances before being punished
as genghis khan had set up an institution that ensured complete religious freedom people under his rule were free to worship as they pleased if the laws of the yassa were observed
many sources provide conjectures about the actual laws of the yassa
the yassa was so influential that other cultures appropriated and adapted portions of it or reworked it for ends of negative propaganda
for instance the number of offenses for which the death penalty was given was well known by contemporaries however harold lamb s genghis khan the emperor of all men quotes a translation by fran ois p tis de la croix
although unable to come upon a complete list of the laws he compiled several from persian and arabic chroniclers such as fras rubruquis and giovanni da pian del carpine
those laws are listed here
it is ordered to believe that there is only one god creator of heaven and earth who alone gives life and death riches and poverty as pleases him and who has over everything an absolute power a different version states that there was liberty to worship god in whatever way suitable plantagenet somerset fry
he chingis khan ordered that all religions were to be respected and that no preference was to be shown to any of them
all this he commanded in order that it might be agreeable to heaven
al makrizi
leaders of a religion lawyers physicians scholars preachers monks persons who are dedicated to religious practice the muezzin this latter appearing to be from the later period of kublai khan unless this was further translated there had been no specific reference made to any muezzin and cities including mosques were levelled physicians and those who bathe the bodies of the dead are to be freed from public charges
al makrizi
it is forbidden under penalty of death that anyone whoever he be shall be proclaimed emperor unless he has been elected previously by the princes khans officers and other mongol nobles in a general council
it is forbidden to make peace with a monarch a prince or a people who has not submitted
it is apparent that they presented certain proposals to the different states or kingdoms that existed that they should participate with them
the ruling that divides men of the army into tens hundreds thousands and ten thousands is to be maintained
he put leaders princes bogatyrs generals noyans at the head of the troops and appointed commanders of thousands hundreds and tens
al makrizi this arrangement serves to raise an army fast and to form the units of commands
the moment that a campaign begins each soldier must receive his arms from the hand of the officer who has them in charge
the soldier must keep them in good order and have them inspected by his officer before a battle
he ordered his successors to personally examine the troops and their armament before going to battle to supply the troops with everything they needed for the campaign and to survey everything even to needle and thread
if any of the soldiers lacked a necessary thing that soldier was to be punished
al makrizi
it is forbidden under death penalty to pillage the enemy before the general commanding gives permission but after that permission is given the soldier must have the same opportunity as the officer and must be allowed to keep what he has carried off if he has paid his share to the receiver for the emperor
he ordered that soldiers be punished for negligence and hunters who let an animal escape during a community hunt he ordered to be beaten with sticks and in some cases to be put to death
mirhond or mirkhwand may appear excluded from some accounts can be a more restricted siberian originating practice but seems genuine
to keep the men of the army exercised a great hunt shall be held every winter
on that account it is forbidden for any man of the empire to kill from march to october deer bucks roe bucks hares wild ass and some birds
it is forbidden to cut the throats of animals slain for food
when an animal is to be eaten its feet must be tied its belly ripped open and its heart squeezed in the hand until the animal dies
then its meat may be eaten but if anyone slaughters an animal after the mohammedan fashion he is to be himself slaughtered
al makrizi women were not supposed to slaughter animals this way possibly due to being weaker there is no prohibition in the yassa
it is permitted to eat the blood and entrails of animals though this was forbidden before now
every man who does not go to war must work for the empire without reward for a certain time
the man in whose possession a stolen horse is found must return it to its owner and add nine horses of the same kind
if he is unable to pay the fine his children must be taken instead of the horses and if he has no children he himself shall be slaughtered like a sheep
al makrizi in the versions in which the provisions appear the method of execution is likened to sheep and so it may be presumed for the law for the slaughter of animals it is unclear in another version as of when their bodies should be cut in two parts
for lesser thefts the punishment shall be according to the value of the thing stolen a number of blows of a staff seven seventeen twenty seven up to seven hundred
the bodily punishment may be avoided by paying nine times the worth of the thing stolen
another older version mentions no punishment for thefts under the value mentioned but is not so specified
no subject of the empire may take a mongol for servant or slave
every man except in rare cases must join the army
whoever gives food or clothing to a captive without the permission of his captor is to be put to death
al makrizi

al makrizi the word translated as slave means captive taken for labor the opponents of the mongols who were usually regarded by them as facing a punishment for resisting the universal principles the mongol system or what it aspired to via its codes and measures the concept was passed on also to their descendants based on the concepts of sedentary populations that degrade the people and criminal tribes criminal often simply by their concept of resisting to the above referred mongol system the word is bo ol linked to modern boolt band for tying booch ch as in chaver in hebrew is in the modern mongolian both associated with the type of binding and process used in capture as a verb and then is translated as meaning slave
however other lands differ in meaning of slave though allied
the law required the payment of a bride price
though not mentioned in other sources it may be that it is a dowry reference since the bride price is usually a custom restricted to specific mongol tribes but that may have appeared later
this may have been practiced earlier but chinggis khan himself had never followed this custom and it was little if at all referred to in the nuvs tobchaan mongolyn
the bride price might have been considered as a useful deterrent to trade in women or simply a modernising experimental inversion from a dowry but the tatars neighbours traded in women which was prohibited as was reported by the yassa and that marriage between the first and second degrees of kinship is forbidden
a man may marry two sisters or have several concubines but under buddhism and shamanism there was a progressive tendency for a marriage ceremony
some buddhist forms revived some casualty without marriage
the women should attend to the care of property buying and selling at their pleasure in another version os mong is by a portuguese publisher of summarised histories of culture the law is quoted as defining trade as their sphere
there is no exclusion from military participation but it was reported more popular among tatars as according to islamic law which was possible to follow only via sufiism
men should occupy themselves only with hunting and war
children born of a concubine are to be considered as legitimate and to receive their share of the heritage according to the disposition of it made by the father
the distribution of property is to be carried out on the basis of the senior son receiving more than the junior the younger son inheriting the household of the father
the seniority of children depends upon the rank of their mother one of the wives must always be the senior to be determined chiefly by the time of her marriage
after the death of his father a son may dispose of the father s wives except his mother
he may marry them or give them in marriage to others
all except the legal heirs are strictly forbidden to make use of any of the property of the deceased

an adulterer is to be put to death without any regard as to whether he is married or not
al makrizi the yasa prescribes these rules to love one another not to commit adultery not to steal not to give false witness not to be a traitor and to respect old people and beggars

mahak ia here are the laws of god which they call iasax which were given to them g first that they love one another second that they not commit adultery not steal not bear false witness not betray anyone and that they honor the aged and the poor

it is forbidden to bathe or wash garments in running water during thunder
whoever intentionally lies or practices sorcery or spies upon the behavior of others or intervenes between the two parties in a quarrel to help the one against the other is also to be put to death
al makrizi intentional liars being included in this section in one of the versions but it is not as definable in practice and may refer to methodical lying which also appears in areas of earlier asiatic influence in europe but becomes particularly defined together with a germanic version which may have legal undertones and a latin practicality
it is a version intended to cause grievous harm to people and damage them and further particularly as a means of sabotage but it is not completely clear
it can also have an aspect of those who practice lying with frivolous purposes

the khan established a postal system so that he might quickly learn about the empire s news
he ordered his son chagatai to see that the yassa was observed
al makrizi verkhovensky reports that the yassa begins with an exhortation to honour men of all nations based on their virtues
the pragmatic admonition is borne out by the ethnic mixture created by genghis khan in the mongolian medieval army for purpose of unity ezent gueligen mongolyn the united mongol warriors
genghis khan consulted teachers of religions such as imams and probably rabbis and christian priests in compiling his law codex ogedei khan the third son of genghis khan and the second great khan proclaimed the great yassa as an integral body of precedents confirming the continuing validity of his father s commands and ordinances and added his own
ogedei codified rules of dress conduct of the kurultais the military council
his two immediate successors followed the tradition of the yassa
the mongols who lived in various parts of the empire began to add laws that were more appropriate to their areas
in the modern turkish language as used presently in turkey the word law is yasa and the adjective legal is yasal
the word for a constitution including the constitution of turkey is anayasa mother law
the word yasa or yassa exists in both mongolic and turkic languages
it is believed that the word comes from the mongolian verb zas or yas which means to set in order
tsereg zasakh is a phrase commonly found in old mongolian texts like the secret history that means to set the soldiers in order in the sense of rallying the soldiers before a battle
the supreme executive body of the present day mongolian government is called the zasag in gazar which means the place of zasag the place of order
zasag during the qing dynasty referred to native provincial governors in mongolia
the local office called zasag in gazar served as a court of the first instance and included secretaries and other officials
