in greek mythology alcinous l s no s ancient greek or alk no s means mighty mind was a son of nausithous and brother of rhexenor
after the latter s death he married his brother s daughter arete who bore him nausicaa halius clytoneus and laodamas
in some accounts alcinous father was phaeax son of poseidon and corcyra and brother of locrus
in the myth of jason and the argonauts alcinous is represented as living with his wife arete on dr pan island
the argonauts on their return from colchis came to his island and were hospitably received
when the colchians in their pursuit of the argonauts likewise arrived in dr pan and demanded that jason s lover medea should be delivered up to them alcinous declared that if she was still a virgin she should be restored to them but if she was already the wife of jason he would protect her and her husband against the colchians
the colchians were obliged by the contrivance of arete to depart without their princess and the argonauts continued their voyage homeward after they had received expensive presents from alcinous
he was also the king of the phaeacians
according to homer alcinous is the happy ruler of the phaiacians in the island of scheria who has by arete five sons and one daughter nausicaa
the description of his palace and his dominions the mode in which odysseus is received the entertainments given to him and the stories he related to the king about his own wanderings occupy a considerable portion of homer s odyssey from book vi
to xiii and form one of its most charming parts
alcinous has a squire pontonous who serves wine during this feast
in conon s narrations when phaiax who reigned on the island of corcyra died alkinous and his brother lokros after quarreling agreed upon on the basis that alcinous would be the king of the phaeacians and locrus would take the heirlooms and part of the ethnos to make a colony
the latter sailed to italy where he married the laurine daughter of king latinus of the italians and for this reason the phaiakians claim the lokrians in italy as relatives
