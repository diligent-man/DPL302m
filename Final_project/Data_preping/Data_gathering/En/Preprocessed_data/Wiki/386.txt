hamites is the name formerly used for some northern and horn of africa peoples in the context of a now outdated model of dividing humanity into different races which was developed originally by europeans in support of colonialism and slavery
the term was originally borrowed from the book of genesis where it is used for the descendants of ham son of noah
the term was originally used in contrast to the other two proposed divisions of mankind based on the story of noah semites and japhetites
the appellation hamitic was applied to the berber cushitic and egyptian branches of the afroasiatic language family which together with the semitic branch was thus formerly labelled hamito semitic
however since the three hamitic branches have not been shown to form an exclusive monophyletic phylogenetic unit of their own separate from other afroasiatic languages linguists no longer use the term in this sense
each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger afroasiatic family
beginning in the th century scholars generally classified the hamitic race as a subgroup of the caucasian race alongside the aryan race and the semitic thus grouping the non semitic populations native to north africa and the horn of africa including the ancient egyptians
according to the hamitic theory this hamitic race was superior to or more advanced than the negroid populations of sub saharan africa
in its most extreme form in the writings of c
seligman this theory asserted that virtually all significant achievements in african history were the work of hamites
since the s the hamitic hypothesis along with other theories of race science has become entirely discredited in science
the term hamitic originally referred to the peoples said to be descended from ham one of the sons of noah according to the bible
according to the book of genesis after noah became drunk and ham dishonored his father upon awakening noah pronounced a curse on ham s youngest son canaan stating that his offspring would be the servants of servants
of ham s four sons canaan fathered the canaanites while mizraim fathered the egyptians cush the cushites and phut the libyans
during the middle ages jews and christians considered ham to be the ancestor of all africans
noah s curse on canaan as described in genesis began to be interpreted by some theologians as having caused visible racial characteristics in all of ham s offspring notably black skin
in a passage unrelated to the curse on canaan the sixth century babylonian talmud says that ham and his descendants were cursed with black skin which modern scholars have interpreted as an etiological myth for skin color
later western and islamic traders and slave owners used the concept of the curse of ham to justify the enslaving of africans
a significant change in western views on africans came about when napoleon s invasion of egypt drew attention to the impressive achievements of ancient egypt which could hardly be reconciled with the theory of africans being inferior or cursed
in consequence some th century theologians emphasized that the biblical noah restricted his curse to the offspring of ham s youngest son canaan while ham s son mizraim the ancestor of the egyptians was not cursed
following the age of enlightenment many western scholars were no longer satisfied with the biblical account of the early history of mankind but started to develop faith independent theories
these theories were developed in a historical situation where most western nations were still profiting from the enslavement of africans
in this context many of the works published on egypt after napoleon s expedition seemed to have had as their main purpose an attempt to prove in some way that the egyptians were not negroes thus separating the high civilization of ancient egypt from what they wanted to see as an inferior race
authors such as w
browne whose travels in africa egypt and syria was published in laid the seeds for the new hamitic myth that was to emerge in the very near future insisting that the egyptians were white
in the mid th century the term hamitic acquired a new anthropological meaning as scholars asserted that they could discern a hamitic race that was distinct from the negroid populations of sub saharan africa
richard lepsius would coin the appellation hamitic to denote the languages which are now seen as belonging to the berber cushitic and egyptian branches of the afroasiatic family
perhaps because slavery was both still legal and profitable in the united states
there arose an american school of anthropology which attempted to prove scientifically that the egyptian was a caucasian far removed from the inferior negro
through craniometry conducted on thousands of human skulls samuel george morton argued that the differences between the races were too broad to have stemmed from a single common ancestor but were instead consistent with separate racial origins
in his crania aegyptiaca morton analyzed over a hundred intact crania gathered from the nile valley and concluded that the ancient egyptians were racially akin to europeans
his conclusions would establish the foundation for the american school of anthropology and would also influence proponents of polygenism
in his influential the mediterranean race the anthropologist giuseppe sergi argued that the mediterranean race had likely originated from a common ancestral stock that evolved in the sahara region in africa and which later spread from there to populate north africa the horn of africa and the circum mediterranean region
according to sergi the hamites themselves constituted a mediterranean variety and one situated close to the cradle of the stock
he added that the mediterranean race in its external characters is a brown human variety neither white nor negroid but pure in its elements that is to say not a product of the mixture of whites with negroes or negroid peoples sergi explained this taxonomy as inspired by an understanding of the morphology of the skull as revealing those internal physical characters of human stocks which remain constant through long ages and at far remote spots as a zoologist can recognise the character of an animal species or variety belonging to any region of the globe or any period of time so also should an anthropologist if he follows the same method of investigating the morphological characters of the skull this method has guided me in my investigations into the present problem and has given me unexpected results which were often afterwards confirmed by archaeology or history
the hamitic hypothesis reached its apogee in the work of c
seligman who argued in his book the races of africa that
seligman asserted that the negro race was essentially static and agricultural and that the wandering pastoral hamitic had introduced most of the advanced features found in central african cultures including metal working irrigation and complex social structures
despite criticism seligman kept his thesis unchanged in new editions of his book into the s
hamitic hypotheses operated in west africa as well and they changed greatly over time
with the demise of the concept of hamitic languages the notion of a definable hamite racial and linguistic entity was heavily criticised
in writing about the african great lakes region christopher ehret described the hamitic hypothesis as the view that almost everything more un primitive sophisticated or more elaborate in east africa was brought by culturally and politically dominant hamites immigrants from the north into east africa who were at least part caucasoid in physical ancestry
he called this a monothematic model which was romantic but unlikely and had been all but discarded and rightly so
he further argued that there were a multiplicity and variety of contacts and influences passing between various peoples in africa over time something that he suggested the one directional hamitic model obscured
sergi outlined the constituent hamitic physical types which would form the basis for the work of later writers such as carleton coon and c
seligman
in his book the mediterranean race he wrote that there was a distinct hamitic ancestral stock which could be divided into two subgroups the western hamites or northern hamites comprising the berbers of the mediterranean atlantic and sahara tibbu fula and extinct guanches and the eastern hamites or ethiopids comprising ancient and modern egyptians but not the arabs in egypt nubians beja abyssinians galla danakil somalis masai bahima and watusi
according to coon typical hamitic physical traits included narrow facial features an orthognathous visage light brown to dark brown skin tone wavy curly or straight hair thick to thin lips without eversion and a dolichocephalic to mesocephalic cranial index
according to ashley montagu among both the northern and eastern hamites are to be found some of the most beautiful types of humanity
in the african great lakes region europeans based the various migration theories of hamitic provenance in part on the long held oral traditions of local populations such as the tutsi and hima bahima wahuma or mhuma
these groups asserted that their founders were white migrants from the north interpreted as the horn of africa and or north africa who subsequently lost their original language culture and much of their physiognomy as they intermarried with the local bantus
explorer j h
speke recorded one such account from a wahuma governor in his book journal of the discovery of the source of the nile
according to augustus henry keane the hima king mutesa i also claimed oromo galla ancestors and still reportedly spoke an oromo idiom though that language had long since died out elsewhere in the region
the missionary r
felkin who had met the ruler remarked that mutesa had lost the pure hamitic features through admixture of negro blood but still retained sufficient characteristics to prevent all doubt as to his origin
thus keane would suggest that the original hamitic migrants to the great lakes had gradually blended with the aborigines in a new and superior nationality of bantu speech
speke believed that his explorations uncovered the link between civilized north africa and primitive central africa
describing the ugandan kingdom of buganda he argued that its barbaric civilization had arisen from a nomadic pastoralist race who had migrated from the north and was related to the hamitic oromo galla of ethiopia
in his theory of conquest of inferior by superior races speke would also attempt to outline how the empire of kitara in the african great lakes region may have been established by a hamitic founding dynasty
these ideas under the rubric of science provided the basis for some europeans asserting that the tutsi were superior to the hutu
in spite of both groups being bantu speaking speke thought that the tutsi had experienced some hamitic influence partly based on their facial features being comparatively more narrow than those of the hutu
later writers followed speke in arguing that the tutsis had originally migrated into the lacustrine region as pastoralists and had established themselves as the dominant group having lost their language as they assimilated to bantu culture
seligman and other early scholars believed that in the african great lakes and parts of central africa invading hamites from north africa and the horn of africa had mixed with local negro women to produce several hybrid hamiticised negro populations
the hamiticised negroes were divided into three groups according to language and degree of hamitic influence the negro hamites or half hamites such as the maasai nandi and turkana the nilotes such as the shilluk and nuer and the bantus such as the hima and tutsi
seligman would explain this hamitic influence through both demic diffusion and cultural transmission
european colonial powers in africa were influenced by the hamitic hypothesis in their policies during the twentieth century
for instance in rwanda german and belgian officials in the colonial period displayed preferential attitudes toward the tutsis over the hutu
some scholars argued that this bias was a significant factor that contributed to the rwandan genocide of the tutsis by the hutus
african american scholars were initially ambivalent about the hamitic hypothesis
because sergi s theory proposed that the superior mediterranean race had originated in africa some african american writers believed that they could appropriate the hamitic hypothesis to challenge nordicist claims about the superiority of the white nordic race
the latter nordic concept was promoted by certain writers such as eugenicist madison grant
according to yaacov shavit this generated radical afrocentric theory which followed the path of european racial doctrines
writers who insisted that the nordics were the purest representatives of the aryan race indirectly encouraged the transformation of the hamitic race into the black race and the resemblance it draws between the different branches of black forms in asia and africa
in response historians published in the journal of negro history stressed the cross fertilization of cultures between africa and europe for instance george wells parker adopted sergi s view that the civilizing race had originated in africa itself
similarly black pride groups appropriated the concept of hamitic identity for their own purposes
parker founded the hamitic league of the world in to inspire the negro with new hopes to make him openly proud of his race and of its great contributions to the religious development and civilization of mankind he argued that fifty years ago one would not have dreamed that science would defend the fact that asia was the home of the black races as well as africa yet it has done just that thing
timothy drew and elijah muhammad developed from this the concept of the asiatic blackman many other authors followed the argument that civilization had originated in hamitic ethiopia a view that became intermingled with biblical imagery
the universal negro improvement association unia believed that ethiopians were the mother race
the nation of islam asserted that the superior black race originated with the lost tribe of shabazz which originally possessed fine features and straight hair but which migrated into central africa lost its religion and declined into a barbaric jungle life
afrocentric writers considered the hamitic hypothesis to be divisive since it asserted the inferiority of negroid peoples
du bois thus argued that the term hamite under which millions of negroes have been characteristically transferred to the white race by some eager scientists was a tool to create false writing on africa
according to du bois livingstone stanley and others were struck with the egyptian features of many of the tribes of africa and this is true of many of the peoples between central africa and egypt so that some students have tried to invent a hamitic race to account for them an entirely unnecessary hypothesis
