hamites name formerly used northern horn africa people context now-outdated model dividing humanity different race wa developed originally european support colonialism slavery
term wa originally borrowed book genesis used descendant ham son noah
term wa originally used contrast two proposed division mankind based story noah semite japhetites
appellation hamitic wa applied berber cushitic egyptian branch afroasiatic language family together semitic branch wa thus formerly labelled hamito-semitic
however since three hamitic branch shown form exclusive monophyletic phylogenetic unit separate afroasiatic language linguist longer use term sense
branch instead regarded independent subgroup larger afroasiatic family
beginning century scholar generally classified hamitic race subgroup caucasian race alongside aryan race semitic thus grouping non-semitic population native north africa horn africa including ancient egyptians
according hamitic theory hamitic race wa superior advanced negroid population sub-saharan africa
seligman theory asserted virtually significant achievement african history work hamites
since hamitic hypothesis along theory race science ha become entirely discredited science
term hamitic originally referred people said descended ham one son noah according bible
according book genesis noah became drunk ham dishonored father upon awakening noah pronounced curse ham's youngest son canaan stating offspring would servant servants
ham's four son canaan fathered canaanite mizraim fathered egyptian cush cushites phut libyans
middle age jew christian considered ham ancestor africans
noah's curse canaan described genesis began interpreted theologian caused visible racial characteristic ham's offspring notably black skin
passage unrelated curse canaan sixth-century babylonian talmud say ham descendant cursed black skin modern scholar interpreted etiological myth skin color
later western islamic trader slave owner used concept curse ham justify enslaving africans
significant change western view african came napoleon's invasion egypt drew attention impressive achievement ancient egypt could hardly reconciled theory african inferior cursed
consequence century theologian emphasized biblical noah restricted curse offspring ham's youngest son canaan ham's son mizraim ancestor egyptian wa cursed
following age enlightenment many western scholar longer satisfied biblical account early history mankind started develop faith-independent theories
theory developed historical situation western nation still profiting enslavement africans
context many work published egypt napoleon's expedition seemed main purpose attempt prove way egyptian negro thus separating high civilization ancient egypt wanted see inferior race
browne whose travel africa egypt syria wa published laid seed new hamitic myth wa emerge near future insisting egyptian white
mid- century term hamitic acquired new anthropological meaning scholar asserted could discern hamitic race wa distinct negroid population sub-saharan africa
richard lepsius would coin appellation hamitic denote language seen belonging berber cushitic egyptian branch afroasiatic family
perhaps slavery wa still legal profitable united states
arose american school anthropology attempted prove scientifically egyptian wa caucasian far removed inferior negro
craniometry conducted thousand human skull samuel george morton argued difference race broad stemmed single common ancestor instead consistent separate racial origins
cranium aegyptiaca morton analyzed hundred intact cranium gathered nile valley concluded ancient egyptian racially akin europeans
conclusion would establish foundation american school anthropology would also influence proponent polygenism
influential mediterranean race anthropologist giuseppe sergi argued mediterranean race likely originated common ancestral stock evolved sahara region africa later spread populate north africa horn africa circum-mediterranean region
according sergi hamites constituted mediterranean variety one situated close cradle stock
added mediterranean race external character brown human variety neither white negroid pure element say product mixture white negro negroid people sergi explained taxonomy inspired understanding morphology skull revealing internal physical character human stock remain constant long age far remote spot
seligman asserted negro race wa essentially static agricultural wandering pastoral hamitic introduced advanced feature found central african culture including metal working irrigation complex social structures
despite criticism seligman kept thesis unchanged new edition book s
hamitic hypothesis operated west africa well changed greatly time
demise concept hamitic language notion definable hamite racial linguistic entity wa heavily criticised
writing african great lake region christopher ehret described hamitic hypothesis view almost everything un-'primitive' sophisticated elaborate east africa wa brought culturally politically dominant hamites immigrant north east africa least part caucasoid physical ancestry
called monothematic model wa romantic unlikely discarded rightly so
argued multiplicity variety contact influence passing various people africa time something suggested one-directional hamitic model obscured
sergi outlined constituent hamitic physical type would form basis work later writer carleton coon c
book mediterranean race wrote wa distinct hamitic ancestral stock could divided two subgroup western hamites northern hamites comprising berber mediterranean atlantic sahara tibbu fula extinct guanches eastern hamites ethiopids comprising ancient modern egyptian arab egypt nubian beja abyssinian galla danakil
according coon typical hamitic physical trait included narrow facial feature orthognathous visage light brown dark brown skin tone wavy curly straight hair thick thin lip without eversion dolichocephalic mesocephalic cranial index
according ashley montagu among northern eastern hamites found beautiful type humanity
african great lake region european based various migration theory hamitic provenance part long-held oral tradition local population tutsi hima bahima wahuma mhuma
group asserted founder white migrant north interpreted horn africa andor north africa subsequently lost original language culture much physiognomy intermarried local bantus
speke recorded one account wahuma governor book journal discovery source nile
according augustus henry keane hima king mutesa also claimed oromo galla ancestor still reportedly spoke oromo idiom though language long since died elsewhere region
felkin met ruler remarked mutesa lost pure hamitic feature admixture negro blood still retained sufficient characteristic prevent doubt origin
thus keane would suggest original hamitic migrant great lake gradually blended aborigine new superior nationality bantu speech
speke believed exploration uncovered link civilized north africa primitive central africa
describing ugandan kingdom buganda argued barbaric civilization arisen nomadic pastoralist race migrated north wa related hamitic oromo galla ethiopia
theory conquest inferior superior race speke would also attempt outline empire kitara african great lake region may established hamitic founding dynasty
idea rubric science provided basis european asserting tutsi superior hutu
spite group bantu-speaking speke thought tutsi experienced hamitic influence partly based facial feature comparatively narrow hutu
later writer followed speke arguing tutsi originally migrated lacustrine region pastoralists established dominant group lost language assimilated bantu culture
seligman early scholar believed african great lake part central africa invading hamites north africa horn africa mixed local negro woman produce several hybrid hamiticised negro populations
hamiticised negro divided three group according language degree hamitic influence negro-hamites half-hamites maasai nandi turkana nilotes shilluk nuer bantu hima tutsi
seligman would explain hamitic influence demic diffusion cultural transmission
european colonial power africa influenced hamitic hypothesis policy twentieth century
instance rwanda german belgian official colonial period displayed preferential attitude toward tutsi hutu
scholar argued bias wa significant factor contributed rwandan genocide tutsi hutus
sergi's theory proposed superior mediterranean race originated africa african-american writer believed could appropriate hamitic hypothesis challenge nordicist claim superiority white nordic race
latter nordic concept wa promoted certain writer eugenicist madison grant
according yaacov shavit generated radical afrocentric theory followed path european racial doctrines
writer insisted nordic purest representative aryan race indirectly encouraged transformation hamitic race black race resemblance draw different branch black form asia africa
response historian published journal negro history stressed cross-fertilization culture africa europe instance george well parker adopted sergi's view civilizing race originated africa itself
similarly black pride group appropriated concept hamitic identity purposes
parker founded hamitic league world inspire negro new hope make openly proud race great contribution religious development civilization mankind argued fifty year ago one would dreamed science would defend fact asia wa home black race well africa yet ha done
timothy drew elijah muhammad developed concept asiatic blackman many author followed argument civilization originated hamitic ethiopia view became intermingled biblical imagery
universal negro improvement association unia believed ethiopian mother race
nation islam asserted superior black race originated lost tribe shabazz originally possessed fine feature straight hair migrated central africa lost religion declined barbaric jungle life
afrocentric writer considered hamitic hypothesis divisive since asserted inferiority negroid peoples
du bois thus argued term hamite million negro characteristically transferred white race eager scientist wa tool create false writing africa
according du bois livingstone stanley others struck egyptian feature many tribe africa true many people central africa egypt student tried invent 'hamitic' race account theman entirely unnecessary hypothesis
