pali p li is a middle indo aryan liturgical language native to the indian subcontinent
it is widely studied because it is the language of the buddhist p li canon or tipi aka as well as the sacred language of therav da buddhism
in early time it was written in brahmi script
the word pali is used as a name for the language of the theravada canon
the word seems to have its origins in commentarial traditions wherein the p li in the sense of the line of original text quoted was distinguished from the commentary or vernacular translation that followed it in the manuscript
norman suggests that its emergence was based on a misunderstanding of the compound p li bh sa with p li being interpreted as the name of a particular language
the name pali does not appear in the canonical literature and in commentary literature is sometimes substituted with tanti meaning a string or lineage
this name seems to have emerged in sri lanka early in the second millennium ce during a resurgence in the use of pali as a courtly and literary language
as such the name of the language has caused some debate among scholars of all ages the spelling of the name also varies being found with both long and short a a and also with either a retroflex or non retroflex l l sound
both the long and retroflex are seen in the iso ala lc rendering p i however to this day there is no single standard spelling of the term and all four possible spellings can be found in textbooks
r c childers translates the word as series and states that the language bears the epithet in consequence of the perfection of its grammatical structure
there is persistent confusion as to the relation of p i to the vernacular spoken in the ancient kingdom of magadha which was located around modern day bih r
beginning in the theravada commentaries pali was identified with magahi the language of the kingdom of magadha and this was taken to also be the language that the buddha used during his life
in the th century the british orientalist robert caesar childers argued that the true or geographical name of the pali language was magadhi prakrit and that because p i means line row series the early buddhists extended the meaning of the term to mean a series of books so p ibh s means language of the texts
however modern scholarship has regarded pali as a mix of several prakrit languages from around the rd century bce combined and partially sanskritized
there is no attested dialect of middle indo aryan with all the features of pali
in the modern era it has been possible to compare pali with inscriptions known to be in magadhi prakrit as well as other texts and grammars of that language
while none of the existing sources specifically document pre ashokan magadhi the available sources suggest that pali is not equatable with that language
modern scholars generally regard pali to have originated from a western dialect rather than an eastern one
pali has some commonalities with both the western ashokan edicts at girnar in saurashtra and the central western prakrit found in the eastern hathigumpha inscription
these similarities lead scholars to associate pali with this region of western india
nonetheless pali does retain some eastern features that have been referred to as m gadhisms
p i as a middle indo aryan language is different from classical sanskrit more with regard to its dialectal base than the time of its origin
a number of its morphological and lexical features show that it is not a direct continuation of gvedic sanskrit
instead it descends from one or more dialects that were despite many similarities different from gvedic
the theravada commentaries refer to the pali language as magadhan or the language of magadha
this identification first appears in the commentaries and may have been an attempt by buddhists to associate themselves more closely with the maurya empire
however only some of the buddha s teachings were delivered in the historical territory of magadha kingdom
scholars consider it likely that he taught in several closely related dialects of middle indo aryan which had a high degree of mutual intelligibility
theravada tradition as recorded in chronicles like the mahavamsa states that the tipitaka was first committed to writing during the first century bce
this move away from the previous tradition of oral preservation is described as being motivated by threats to the sangha from famine war and the growing influence of the rival tradition of the abhayagiri vihara
this account is generally accepted by scholars though there are indications that pali had already begun to be recorded in writing by this date
by this point in its history scholars consider it likely that pali had already undergone some initial assimilation with sanskrit such as the conversion of the middle indic bamhana to the more familiar sanskrit br hmana that contemporary brahmans used to identify themselves
in sri lanka pali is thought to have entered into a period of decline ending around the th or th century as sanskrit rose in prominence and simultaneously as buddhism s adherents became a smaller portion of the subcontinent but ultimately survived
the work of buddhaghosa was largely responsible for its reemergence as an important scholarly language in buddhist thought
the visuddhimagga and the other commentaries that buddhaghosa compiled codified and condensed the sinhala commentarial tradition that had been preserved and expanded in sri lanka since the rd century bce
with only a few possible exceptions the entire corpus of pali texts known today is believed to derive from the anuradhapura maha viharaya in sri lanka
while literary evidence exists of theravadins in mainland india surviving into the th century no pali texts specifically attributable to this tradition have been recovered
some texts such as the milindapanha may have been composed in india before being transmitted to sri lanka but the surviving versions of the texts are those preserved by the mahavihara in ceylon and shared with monasteries in theravada southeast asia
the earliest inscriptions in pali found in mainland southeast asia are from the first millennium ce some possibly dating to as early as the th century
inscriptions are found in what are now burma laos thailand and cambodia and may have spread from southern india rather than sri lanka
by the th century a so called pali renaissance began in the vicinity of pagan gradually spreading to the rest of mainland southeast asia as royal dynasties sponsored monastic lineages derived from the mahavihara of anuradhapura
this era was also characterized by the adoption of sanskrit conventions and poetic forms such as kavya that had not been features of earlier pali literature
this process began as early as the th century but intensified early in the second millennium as pali texts on poetics and composition modeled on sanskrit forms began to grow in popularity
one milestone of this period was the publication of the subodhalankara during the th century a work attributed to sangharakkhita mah s mi and modeled on the sanskrit kavyadarsa
despite an expansion of the number and influence of mahavihara derived monastics this resurgence of pali study resulted in no production of any new surviving literary works in pali
during this era correspondences between royal courts in sri lanka and mainland southeast asia were conducted in pali and grammars aimed at speakers of sinhala burmese and other languages were produced
the emergence of the term pali as the name of the language of the theravada canon also occurred during this era
while pali is generally recognized as an ancient language no epigraphical or manuscript evidence has survived from the earliest eras
the earliest samples of pali discovered are inscriptions believed to date from th to th century located in mainland southeast asia specifically central siam and lower burma
these inscriptions typically consist of short excerpts from the pali canon and non canonical texts and include several examples of the ye dhamma hetu verse
surprisingly the oldest surviving pali manuscript was discovered in nepal dating to the th century
it is in the form of four palm leaf folios using a transitional script deriving from the gupta script to scribe a fragment of the cullavagga
the oldest known manuscripts from sri lanka and southeast asia date to the th th century with few surviving examples
very few manuscripts older than years have survived and complete manuscripts of the four nikayas are only available in examples from the th century and later
pali was first mentioned in western literature in simon de la loub re s descriptions of his travels in the kingdom of siam
an early grammar and dictionary was published by methodist missionary benjamin clough in and an initial study published by eug ne burnouf and christian lassen in essai sur le pali ou langue sacree de la presqu ile au dela du gange
the first modern pali english dictionary was published by robert childers in and
following the foundation of the pali text society english pali studies grew rapidly and childer s dictionary became outdated
planning for a new dictionary began in the early s but delays including the outbreak of world war i meant that work was not completed until
t w rhys davids in his book buddhist india and wilhelm geiger in his book p li literature and language suggested that pali may have originated as a lingua franca or common language of culture among people who used differing dialects in north india used at the time of the buddha and employed by him
another scholar states that at that time it was a refined and elegant vernacular of all aryan speaking people
modern scholarship has not arrived at a consensus on the issue there are a variety of conflicting theories with supporters and detractors
after the death of the buddha pali may have evolved among buddhists out of the language of the buddha as a new artificial language
childers who held to the theory that pali was old magadhi wrote had gautama never preached it is unlikely that magadhese would have been distinguished from the many other vernaculars of hindustan except perhaps by an inherent grace and strength which make it a sort of tuscan among the prakrits
according to k r norman differences between different texts within the canon suggest that it contains material from more than a single dialect
he also suggests it is likely that the viharas in north india had separate collections of material preserved in the local dialect
in the early period it is likely that no degree of translation was necessary in communicating this material to other areas
around the time of ashoka there had been more linguistic divergence and an attempt was made to assemble all the material
it is possible that a language quite close to the pali of the canon emerged as a result of this process as a compromise of the various dialects in which the earliest material had been preserved and this language functioned as a lingua franca among eastern buddhists from then on
following this period the language underwent a small degree of sanskritisation i e mia bamhana brahmana tta tva in some cases
bhikkhu bodhi summarizing the current state of scholarship states that the language is closely related to the language or more likely the various regional dialects that the buddha himself spoke
he goes on to write
according to a k warder the pali language is a prakrit language used in a region of western india
warder associates pali with the indian realm janapada of avanti where the sthavira nik ya was centered
following the initial split in the buddhist community the sthavira nik ya became influential in western and south india while the mah s ghika branch became influential in central and east india
akira hirakawa and paul groner also associate pali with western india and the sthavira nik ya citing the saurashtran inscriptions which are linguistically closest to the pali language
although sanskrit was said in the brahmanical tradition to be the unchanging language spoken by the gods in which each word had an inherent significance such views for any language was not shared in the early buddhist traditions in which words were only conventional and mutable signs
this view of language naturally extended to pali and may have contributed to its usage as an approximation or standardization of local middle indic dialects in place of sanskrit
however by the time of the compilation of the pali commentaries th or th century pali was described by the anonymous authors as the natural language the root language of all beings
comparable to ancient egyptian latin or hebrew in the mystic traditions of the west pali recitations were often thought to have a supernatural power which could be attributed to their meaning the character of the reciter or the qualities of the language itself and in the early strata of buddhist literature we can already see pali dh ra s used as charms as for example against the bite of snakes
many people in theravada cultures still believe that taking a vow in pali has a special significance and as one example of the supernatural power assigned to chanting in the language the recitation of the vows of a gulim la are believed to alleviate the pain of childbirth in sri lanka
in thailand the chanting of a portion of the abhidhammapi aka is believed to be beneficial to the recently departed and this ceremony routinely occupies as much as seven working days
there is nothing in the latter text that relates to this subject and the origins of the custom are unclear
pali died out as a literary language in mainland india in the fourteenth century but survived elsewhere until the eighteenth
today pali is studied mainly to gain access to buddhist scriptures and is frequently chanted in a ritual context
the secular literature of pali historical chronicles medical texts and inscriptions is also of great historical importance
the great centres of pali learning remain in sri lanka and other theravada nations of southeast asia myanmar thailand laos and cambodia
since the th century various societies for the revival of pali studies in india have promoted awareness of the language and its literature including the maha bodhi society founded by anagarika dhammapala
in europe the pali text society has been a major force in promoting the study of pali by western scholars since its founding in
based in the united kingdom the society publishes romanized pali editions along with many english translations of these sources
in the first pali dictionary was published using the research of robert caesar childers one of the founding members of the pali text society
it was the first pali translated text in english and was published in
childers dictionary later received the volney prize in
the pali text society was founded in part to compensate for the very low level of funds allocated to indology in late th century england and the rest of the uk incongruously the citizens of the uk were not nearly so robust in sanskrit and prakrit language studies as germany russia and even denmark
even without the inspiration of colonial holdings such as the former british occupation of sri lanka and burma institutions such as the danish royal library have built up major collections of pali manuscripts and major traditions of pali studies
pali literature is usually divided into canonical and non canonical or extra canonical texts
canonical texts include the whole of the pali canon or tipitaka
with the exception of three books placed in the khuddaka nikaya by only the burmese tradition these texts consisting of the five nikayas of the sutta pitaka the vinaya pitaka and the books of the abhidhamma pitaka are traditionally accepted as containing the words of the buddha and his immediate disciples by the theravada tradition
extra canonical texts can be divided into several categories
commentaries atthakatha which record additional details and explanations regarding the contents of the suttas
sub commentaries k which explain and add contents to the commentaries
chronicles va sa which relate the history of buddhism in sri lanka as well as the origins of famous relics and shrines and the deeds of historical and mythical kings
manuals and treatises which include summaries of canonical books and compendia of teachings and techniques like the visuddhimagga
abhidhamma manuals which explain the contents of the abhidhamma pitakaother types of texts present in pali literature include works on grammar and poetics medical texts astrological and divination texts cosmologies and anthologies or collections of material from the canonical literature
while the majority of works in pali are believed to have originated with the sri lankan tradition and then spread to other theravada regions some texts may have other origins
the milinda panha may have originated in northern india before being translated from sanskrit or gandhari prakrit
there are also a number of texts that are believed to have been composed in pali in sri lanka thailand burma but were not widely circulated
this regional pali literature is currently relatively little known particularly in the thai tradition with many manuscripts never catalogued or published
pai c is a largely unattested literary language of classical india that is mentioned in prakrit and sanskrit grammars of antiquity
it is found grouped with the prakrit languages with which it shares some linguistic similarities but was not considered a spoken language by the early grammarians because it was understood to have been purely a literary language
in works of sanskrit poetics such as da in s kavyadarsha it is also known by the name of bh tabh an epithet which can be interpreted as dead language i e with no surviving speakers or bh ta means past and bh means language i e
a language spoken in the past
evidence which lends support to this interpretation is that literature in pai c is fragmentary and extremely rare but may once have been common
the th century tibetan historian buton rinchen drub wrote that the early buddhist schools were separated by choice of sacred language the mah s ghikas used pr krit the sarv stiv dins used sanskrit the sthavirav dins used pai c and the sa mit ya used apabhra a
this observation has led some scholars to theorize connections between pali and pai c sten konow concluded that it may have been an indo aryan language spoken by dravidian people in south india and alfred master noted a number of similarities between surviving fragments and pali morphology
ardhamagadhi prakrit was a middle indo aryan language and a dramatic prakrit thought to have been spoken in modern day bihar eastern uttar pradesh and used in some early buddhist and jain drama
it was originally thought to be a predecessor of the vernacular magadhi prakrit hence the name literally half magadhi
ardham gadh was prominently used by jain scholars and is preserved in the jain agamas
ardhamagadhi prakrit differs from later magadhi prakrit in similar ways to pali and was often believed to be connected with pali on the basis of the belief that pali recorded the speech of the buddha in an early magadhi dialect
magadhi prakrit was a middle indic language spoken in present day bihar and eastern uttar pradesh
its use later expanded southeast to include some regions of modern day bengal odisha and assam and it was used in some prakrit dramas to represent vernacular dialogue
preserved examples of magadhi prakrit are from several centuries after the theorized lifetime of the buddha and include inscriptions attributed to asoka maurya
differences observed between preserved examples of magadhi prakrit and pali lead scholars to conclude that pali represented a development of a northwestern dialect of middle indic rather than being a continuation of a language spoken in the area of magadha in the time of the buddha
nearly every word in p i has cognates in the other middle indo aryan languages the prakrits
the relationship to vedic sanskrit is less direct and more complicated the prakrits were descended from old indo aryan vernaculars
historically influence between pali and sanskrit has been felt in both directions
the pali language s resemblance to sanskrit is often exaggerated by comparing it to later sanskrit compositions which were written centuries after sanskrit ceased to be a living language and are influenced by developments in middle indic including the direct borrowing of a portion of the middle indic lexicon whereas a good deal of later pali technical terminology has been borrowed from the vocabulary of equivalent disciplines in sanskrit either directly or with certain phonological adaptations
post canonical pali also possesses a few loan words from local languages where pali was used e g
sri lankans adding sinhala words to pali
these usages differentiate the pali found in the suttapi aka from later compositions such as the pali commentaries on the canon and folklore e g commentaries on the jataka tales and comparative study and dating of texts on the basis of such loan words is now a specialized field unto itself
pali was not exclusively used to convey the teachings of the buddha as can be deduced from the existence of a number of secular texts such as books of medical science instruction in pali
however scholarly interest in the language has been focused upon religious and philosophical literature because of the unique window it opens on one phase in the development of buddhism
vowels may be divided into
pure vowels a
sonant vowels i u
diphthongs e o
vowels short by nature a i u
vowels long by nature
vowels of variable length e olong and short vowels are only contrastive in open syllables in closed syllables all vowels are always short
short and long e and o are in complementary distribution the short variants occur only in closed syllables the long variants occur only in open syllables
short and long e and o are therefore not distinct phonemes
vowels e and o are long in an open syllable
at the end of a syllable as in ne tum to lead
at the end of a syllable as in so tum to hear
vowels are short in a closed syllable
when followed by a consonant with which they make a syllable as in upek kh indifference sot thi safety
for vowels e appears for a before double consonance
seyy sayy bed
pheggu phaigu empty worthless the vowels i and u are lengthened in the flexional endings including hi hi and su
a sound called anusv ra skt pali niggah ta represented by the letter iso or ala lc in romanization and by a raised dot in most traditional alphabets originally marked the fact that the preceding vowel was nasalized
that is a i and u represented and
in many traditional pronunciations however the anusv ra is pronounced more strongly like the velar nasal so that these sounds are pronounced instead and
however pronounced never follows a long vowel and are converted to the corresponding short vowels when is added to a stem ending in a long vowel e g
kath becomes katha not kath dev becomes devi not dev
changes of vowels due to the structure of the word
final vowels
the final consonants of the sanskrit words have been dropped in pali and thus all the words end in a vowel or in a nasal vowel k nt t kant from the loved one k nt kanta the loved one
the final vowels were usually weak in pronunciation and hence they were shortened ak rsit ak si he did
the table below lists the consonants of pali using thai script of the many other possible scripts
in bold is the transliteration of the letter in traditional romanization and in square brackets its pronunciation transcribed in the ipa
among the labial consonants is labiodental and the rest is bilabial
among the dental alveolar consonants the majority is dental but s and l are alveolar
of the sounds listed above only the three consonants in parentheses and h are not distinct phonemes in pali only occurs before velar stops while and h are allophones of single and h occurring between vowels
in pali language the consonants may be divided according to their strength or power of resistance
the strength decreases in the order of mutes sibilant nasals l v y r
when two consonants come together they are subject to one of the following change
they are assimilated to each other
they are first adapted and then assimilated to each other
they give rise to a new consonant group
they separated by the insertion of a vowel infix
they are sometimes interchanged by metathesisaspirate consonants
when one of the two consonants is the sibilant s then the new group of consonants has the aspiration in the last consonant as ti root as atthi is
the sibilant s followed by a nasal is changed to h and then it is transposed after the nasal akas ma akah ma akamha we did
alternation between y and v
pali v appears for skr
for instance vudha yudha weapon kas va kas ya dirt sin
after the svarabhakti vowel i there appear v instead of y as in pra yamsa pativimsa
alternation between r and l
representation of r by l is very common in pali and in pkr
it is the rule for magadhi although this substitution occurs sporadically also in other dialect
this initially in l jjati r jyate falls apart sometimes double forms with l and r occur in skr l kha l ksa r ksa gross bad
pali is a highly inflected language in which almost every word contains besides the root conveying the basic meaning one or more affixes usually suffixes which modify the meaning in some way
nouns are inflected for gender number and case verbal inflections convey information about person number tense and mood
pali nouns inflect for three grammatical genders masculine feminine and neuter and two numbers singular and plural
the nouns also in principle display eight cases nominative or paccatta case vocative accusative or upayoga case instrumental or kara a case dative or sampad na case ablative genitive or s min case and locative or bhumma case however in many instances two or more of these cases are identical in form this is especially true of the genitive and dative cases
a stems whose uninflected stem ends in short a are either masculine or neuter
the masculine and neuter forms differ only in the nominative vocative and accusative cases
nouns ending in a are almost always feminine
i stems and u stems are either masculine or neuter
the masculine and neuter forms differ only in the nominative and accusative cases
the vocative has the same form as the nominative
from the opening of the dhammapada
the three compounds in the first line literally mean
manopubba gama whose precursor is mind having mind as a fore goer or leader
manose ha whose foremost member is mind having mind as chief
manomaya consisting of mind or made by mind the literal meaning is therefore the dharmas have mind as their leader mind as their chief are made of by mind
if someone either speaks or acts with a corrupted mind from that cause suffering goes after him as the wheel of a cart follows the foot of a draught animal
a slightly freer translation by acharya buddharakkhita
mind precedes all mental states
mind is their chief they are all mind wrought
if with an impure mind a person speaks or acts suffering follows him
like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox pali and sanskrit are very closely related and the common characteristics of pali and sanskrit were always easily recognized by those in india who were familiar with both
a large part of pali and sanskrit word stems are identical in form differing only in details of inflection
technical terms from sanskrit were converted into pali by a set of conventional phonological transformations
these transformations mimicked a subset of the phonological developments that had occurred in proto pali
because of the prevalence of these transformations it is not always possible to tell whether a given pali word is a part of the old prakrit lexicon or a transformed borrowing from sanskrit
the existence of a sanskrit word regularly corresponding to a pali word is not always secure evidence of the pali etymology since in some cases artificial sanskrit words were created by back formation from prakrit words
the following phonological processes are not intended as an exhaustive description of the historical changes which produced pali from its old indic ancestor but rather are a summary of the most common phonological equations between sanskrit and pali with no claim to completeness

since aspiration of a geminate consonant is only phonetically detectable on the last consonant of a cluster geminate kh gh ch jh h h th dh ph and bh appear as kkh ggh cch jjh h h tth ddh pph and bbh not as khkh ghgh etc

historically the first written record of the pali canon is believed to have been composed in sri lanka based on a prior oral tradition
according to the mahavamsa the chronicle of sri lanka due to a major famine in the country buddhist monks wrote down the pali canon during the time of king vattagamini in bce
bilingual coins containing pali written in the kharosthi script and greek writing were used by james prinsep to decipher the kharosthi abugida
this script became particularly significant for the study of early buddhism following the discovery of the gandharan buddhist texts
the transmission of written pali has retained a universal system of alphabetic values but has expressed those values in a variety of different scripts
in sri lanka pali texts were recorded in sinhala script
other local scripts most prominently khmer burmese and in modern times thai since devan gar and mon script mon state burma have been used to record pali
since the th century pali has also been written in the roman script
an alternate scheme devised by frans velthuis called the velthuis scheme see text in ascii allows for typing without diacritics using plain ascii methods but is arguably less readable than the standard iast system which uses diacritical marks
the pali alphabetical order is as follows
