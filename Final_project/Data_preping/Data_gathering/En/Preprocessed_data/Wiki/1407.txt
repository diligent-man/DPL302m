kapitayan from javanese is a belief of ancient people on java island namely those who belong to the javanese ethnic group since the paleolithic mesolithic neolithic and megalithic eras
the kapitayan religion is a form of monotheism native to java that has been adopted and carried on by javanese people from generation to generation since ancient times
the local javanese referred to it as the monotheist ancient javanese religion ancestral monotheist religion or tiyang jawi javanese religion which is different from kejawen another javanism that is non monotheistic
the term kapitayan is old javanese in origin and was constructed from the base word of taya old javanese script which means unimaginable unseen or absolute literally thus it means that taya cannot be thought or imagined or cannot be approached by the five senses
kapitayan can be described as a teaching that worships the main god called sanghyang taya javanese script which means unimaginable entity also called suwung awang or uwung
the term awang uwung refers to the real existence but unreachable thus it can be known and worshiped by worldly beings including humans the sanghyang taya is described as personal in the name and divine nature called tu or to which means magical power which is supernatural
the deity or god in the kapitayan religion is called sang hyang taya
the deity within the kapitayan religion belief is abstract or can not be described
sang hyang taya is defined as tan keno kinaya ngapa means cannot be seen thought about or imagined thus his existence is unreachable by worldly capacity
for this reason in order to be worshiped sanghyang taya has a personal name and attribute called tu or to which means magical power which is supernatural
tu or to are singular in essence a single entity
tu is commonly referred to by the name sanghyang tunggal
he has two qualities namely goodness and wickedness
tu who is good is generally known as the tuhan in javanese called by its name sanghyang wenang
tu who is wicked is called by the name of sanghyang manikmaya
thus sanghyang wenang and sanghyang manikmaya are essentially just the nature of the sanghyang tunggal
therefore both sanghyang tunggal sanghyang wenang and sanghyang wenang are supernatural and cannot be approached with the five senses and the mind
only his character is known
sang hyang taya s power is then represented in various places such as on rocks monuments trees and in many other places
therefore they make offerings over that place not because they worship stones trees monuments or anything else but they do so as their devotion to sang hyang taya whose power is represented in all those places
the kapitayan religion does not recognize gods as in hinduism and buddhism
this kapitayan religion is an ancient religion studied in archaeological studies whose archaeological remains and relics in western terminology are known as dolmens menhirs sarcophagi and others which indicate the existence of ancient religions in java island
and by dutch historians during colonialism this religion is mistakenly identified as animism and dynamism because the colonizers interpreted kapitayan followers as the worshipper of trees rocks and spirits which according to ma huan s point of view those practice of worshiping is called an unbeliever or infidel
but however in fact the kapitayan is more like monotheism than animism dynamism as most researchers think
the mention as animism dynamism itself arises because in physical appearance the rituals performed by its adherents appear to be worship of objects
in simple terms the worship of objects is understood as worship of the power of the object itself animism dynamism
in fact initially the kapitayan teachings did not worship the object as absolute power but rather worshiped sang hyang the highest power
objects contained in religious rituals such as trees stones and springs are just a few manifestations of the supreme power of sang hyang
because the sanghyang tunggal with these dual qualities is supernatural to worship him requires means that can be approached by the five senses and the human mind
that s why in the kapitayan teachings there is a belief which states that the supernatural power of the sanghyang taya called tu or to is hidden in everything that has the name tu or to
the followers of kapitayan teachings believe in the existence of supernatural powers in wa tu tu gu tu tuk tu nda tu lang tu nggul tu ak tu k tu ban tu mbak tunggak tu lup tu ngkub tu rumbukan un tu pin tu tu tud to peng to san to pong to parem to wok to ya
the remains of these worship facilities are known in archeology as menhir dolmen punden berundak nekara sarcophagus and others
in worshiping sanghyang taya through these means people provide offerings in the form of tumpeng tu mbal tu mbu tu kung tu d to sanghyang taya through something that is believed to have supernatural powers
a person who worships sanghyang taya who is considered pious will be blessed with supernatural powers that are positive tu ah and negative tu lah
those who have been gifted with the tu ah and tu lah are considered entitled to become community leaders
they are called ra tu or dha tu ruler
those who have been gifted with tu ah and tu lah their life movements will be marked by pi which is the hidden power of sanghyang taya s divine secret
that s why ra tu or dha tu call themselves with the personal pronoun pi nakahulun
if speaking it is called pi dato
if heard called pi harsa
if teaching knowledge is called pi wulang
if giving advice is called pi tutur
if it gives a hint called pi tuduh
if punishing called pi dana
if it gives firmness it is called piandel
when providing offerings to ancestral spirits it is called pitapuja usually in the form of pi nda flour cake pi nang pi tik pindodakakriya rice and water pi sang
if it radiates power is called pi deksa
if they die it is called pi tara
a ra tu or dha tu is the embodiment of sanghyang taya s supernatural powers
a ratu is the image of the sole sanghyang personal
these kapitayan s religious values was then adopted by the walisongo in spreading islam toward the regions
because the concept of tawhid in kapitayan is basically same with the concept of tawhid in islam the term of tan keno kinaya ngapa in kapitayan can t be seen can t be thought can t be imagined he is beyond everything have the same equal meaning as laisa kamitslihi syai un in islam there is nothing like unto him qur an surah ash syura chapter verse
walisongo also use the term sembahyang worshipping sang hyang taya in kapitayan in introducing the term of shalat in islam
in term of places for worship or praying walisongo also using the term sanggar in kapitayan which represents a four square building with an empty hole on its wall as the symbol of sang hyang taya in kapitayan not arca or statues as in hindu or buddhism
this term of place for praying or worshipping in kapitayan also used by walisongo by the name langgar represents the term of masjid in islam
there s also a ritual in form of not eating from morning up until night in kapitayan which is called as upawasa puasa or poso
incidentally the ritual of fasting in hinduism is also called upawasa or upavasa
instead of using the term of fasting or siyam in islam walisongo used the term of puasa or upawasa from the kapitayan in describing the ritual
the term of poso dino pitu in kapitayan whose means fasting on the day of the second and the fifth day in which is equal to seven days of fasting is very similar with the form of fasting on mondays and thursdays in islam
the tradition of tumpengan of kapitayan was also being kept by the walisongo under the islamic perspective as known as sedekah
this is the meaning of the terminology in which gus dur indonesian fourth president mentioned as mempribumikan islam indigenize islam
in order to worship sanghyang tunggal kapitayan adherents provide offerings in the form of tu mpeng tu mpi cake made of flour tumbu square basket made of woven bamboo for flower holders tu ak wine tu kung a kind of chicken to be offered to sanghyang tunggal whose magical power is hidden in everything that is believed to have supernatural powers such as tu ngkub tu nda wa tu tu gu tu nggak tu k tu ban tu rumbukan tu tuk
kapitayan followers who have the intention of doing tu ju divination or other urgent needs will worship sanghyang tunggal with a special offering called tu mbal
in contrast to the worship of the sanghyang tunggal which is carried out by ordinary people by offering offerings in sacred places to worship sanghyang taya directly the practice commonly carried out by the kapitayan clergy takes place in a place called the sanggar which is a rectangular building with an overlapping roof
tu tu k alcove hole in the wall as a symbol of the emptiness of sanghyang taya
in praying to sanghyang taya in the sanggar the kapitayan clergy follow certain rules at first the worshiping clergyman performs tu lajeg standing still facing tutu k alcove hole with both hands raised up to present sanghyang taya in tutu d heart
after feeling sanghyang taya residing in the heart both hands were lowered and clasped to the chest right to the heart
this position is called swa dikep holding one s personal self
the tu lajeg process is carried out in a relatively long time
after the tu lajeg is finished the prayer is continued with the tu ngkul position bent down looking down which is also carried out for a relatively long time
then proceed again with the tu lumpak position kneeling with both heels occupied
finally the to ndhem position is performed prostrate like a baby in its mother s stomach
while performing tu lajeg tu ngkul tu lumpak and to ndhem for more than an hour the kapitayan spiritualists with all their feelings tried to maintain the continuity of the existence of sanghyang taya which had been buried in tutu d heart
