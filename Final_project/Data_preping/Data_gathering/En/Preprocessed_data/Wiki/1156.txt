The National Association of Local Councils (NALC) is an association with a membership of approximately 80% of the 9,800 independently elected community, parish and town councils in England.
Established in 1947, the National Association of Local Councils is the national body which represents the interests of 10,000 local (parish and town) councils and 100,000 councillors across England
NALC works to support, promote and improve local councils
"Local council" is an umbrella term in England for community, neighbourhood, parish and town councils, which are the first tier of English local government
It was created by Charles Arnold-Baker from the  National Association of Parish Councils.
The duties of the NALC include lobbying national government on behalf of its members and their electorates
The association provides support, advice and training for member councils, as well as holding an annual conference
It also offers advice and technical guidance to individuals or groups who plan to create new councils for unrepresented communities or areas.
All member councils are represented on one of 38 independent County Associations, which provide most of the support the NALC gives to its members
Every County Association elects one representative from among its members to sit on the National Council
It is the National Council that is largely responsible for representing members to national government.
NALC also provides the Secretariat for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Local Democracy, currently chaired by Tessa Munt.
The Head Office of the organisation is at 109 Great Russell Street in Bloomsbury, central London.
