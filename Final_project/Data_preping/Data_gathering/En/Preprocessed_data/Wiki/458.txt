the battle of cajamarca also spelled cajamalca though many contemporary scholars prefer to call it massacre of cajamarca was the ambush and seizure of the inca ruler atahualpa by a small spanish force led by francisco pizarro on november
the spanish killed thousands of atahualpa s counselors commanders and unarmed attendants in the great plaza of cajamarca and caused his armed host outside the town to flee
the capture of atahualpa marked the opening stage of the conquest of the pre columbian civilization of peru
the confrontation at cajamarca was the culmination of a months long struggle involving espionage subterfuge and diplomacy between pizarro and the inca via their respective envoys
atahualpa had received the invaders from a position of immense strength
encamped along the heights of cajamarca with a large force of nearly battle tested troops fresh from their victories in the civil war against his half brother hu scar the inca felt they had little to fear from pizarro s tiny army however exotic its dress and weaponry
in an ostensible show of goodwill atahualpa had lured the adventurers deep into the heart of his mountain empire where any potential threat could be isolated and responded to with massive force
pizarro and his men arrived on friday november
the town itself had been largely emptied of its two thousand inhabitants upon the approach of the spanish force of men guided by an inca noble sent by atahualpa as an envoy
atahualpa himself was encamped outside cajamarca preparing for his march on cuzco where his commanders had just captured hu scar and defeated his army
the book history of the conquest of peru written by th century author william h
prescott recounts the dilemma in which the spanish force found itself
any assault on the inca armies overlooking the valley would have been suicidal
retreat was equally out of the question because any show of weakness might have undermined their air of invincibility and would invite pursuit and closure of the mountain passes
once the great stone fortresses dotting their route of escape were garrisoned argued pizarro they would prove impregnable
but to do nothing he added was no better since prolonged contact with the natives would erode the fears of spanish supernatural ways that kept them at bay
pizarro gathered his officers on the evening of november and outlined a scheme that recalled memories of cort s exploits in mexico in its audacity he would capture the emperor from within the midst of his own armies
since this could not realistically be accomplished in an open field pizarro had invited the inca to cajamarca
the next afternoon atahualpa led a procession of a greater part of the inca s forces but pizarro s fortunes changed dramatically when atahualpa announced that most of his host would set up camp outside the walls of the city
he requested that accommodations be provided only for himself and his retinue which would forsake its weapons in a sign of amity and absolute confidence
shortly before sunset atahualpa left the armed warriors who had accompanied him on an open meadow about half a mile outside cajamarca
his immediate party still numbered over seven thousand but were unarmed except for small battle axes intended for show
atahualpa s attendants were richly dressed in what were apparently ceremonial garments
many wore gold or silver discs on their heads and the main party was preceded by a group wearing livery of chequered colors who sang while sweeping the roadway in front of atahualpa
the inca himself was carried in a litter lined with parrot feathers and partly covered in silver carried by eighty inca courtiers of high rank in vivid blue clothing
atahualpa s intention appears to have been to impress the small spanish force with this display of splendor and he had no anticipation of an ambush
the spaniards had concealed themselves within the buildings surrounding the empty plaza at the centre of the town
infantry and horsemen were concealed in the alleyways which opened onto this open square
spanish infantry were deployed to guard the entrances to a stone building in the centre of the square while men armed with arquebuses and four small cannon took up places within it
pizarro ordered his men to remain silent and hidden until the guns were fired
during the hours of waiting tension rose amongst the greatly outnumbered spanish and pedro pizarro recalls that many of his fellows urinated out of pure terror
upon entering the square the leading incans in attendance on atahualpa divided their ranks to enable his litter to be carried to the centre where all stopped
an incan courtier carrying a banner approached the building where the artillery was concealed while atahualpa surprised at seeing no spanish called out an enquiry
after a brief pause friar vincente de valverde accompanied by an interpreter emerged from the building where pizarro was lodged
carrying a cross and a missal the friar passed through the rows of attendants who had spread out to allow the inca s litter to reach the centre of the square
valverde approached the inca announced himself as the emissary of god and the spanish throne and demanded that he accept catholicism as his faith and charles v the holy roman emperor as his sovereign ruler
atahualpa was insulted and confused by valverde s words
although atahualpa had already determined that he had no intention of conceding to the dictates of the spanish according to chronicler garcilaso de la vega he did attempt a brusque bemused inquiry into the details of the spaniards faith and their king which quickly bogged down in poorly translated semantics and increased the tension of all the participants
spanish sources differ as to the specific event which initiated combat but all agree it was a spontaneous decision following the breakdown of negotiations such as they were with atahualpa
titu cusi yupanqui son of atahualpa s half brother manco ii who had escaped the killings of atahualpa s general quizquiz dictated decades later the only inca account of the events leading up to the battle
according to titu cusi atahualpa had received two viracochas pizarro and de soto at a date not specified many days before the battle offering them a golden cup containing ceremonial chicha
the spaniard poured it out the spaniards then gave atahualpa a letter or book which they said was quillca writing of god and of the spanish king
offended by the wasting of the chicha atahualpa threw the letter or whatever it was on the ground telling them to leave
on november atahualpa arrived at cajamarca with no weapons for battle or harnesses for defense although they did carry tomes knives and lassos for hunting llamas
the spanish approached and told atahualpa that virococha had ordered them to tell the inca who they were
atahualpa listened then gave one a gold cup of chicha which was not drunk and given no attention at all
furious atahualpa stood and yelled if you disrespect me i will also disrespect you and said he would kill them at which the spanish attacked
titu cusi s only mention of a bible being presented and then tossed to the ground is restricted to the encounter which took place before the battle an omission that has been explained as due either to its relative insignificance to the inca or to confusion between the events of the two days
at the signal to attack the spaniards unleashed gunfire at the vulnerable mass of incans and surged forward in a concerted action
the effect was devastating and the shocked and unarmed incans offered little resistance
the spanish forces used a cavalry charge against the incan forces in combination with gunfire from cover the incan forces also had never encountered firearms before combined with the ringing bells on the horses to frighten the inca
the first target of the spanish attack was atahualpa and his top commanders
pizarro rushed at atahualpa on horseback but the inca remained motionless
the spanish severed the hands or arms of the attendants carrying atahualpa s litter to force them to drop it so they could reach him
the spanish were astounded that the attendants ignored their wounds and used their stumps or remaining hands to hold it up until several were killed and the litter slumped
atahualpa remained sitting on the litter while a large number of his attendants rushed to place themselves between the litter and the spanish deliberately allowing themselves to be killed
while his men were cutting down atahualpa s attendants pizarro rode through them to where a spanish soldier had pulled the inca from his litter
while he was doing so other soldiers also reached the litter and one attempted to kill atahualpa
recognizing the value of the emperor as a hostage pizarro blocked the attack and received a sword wound to his hand in consequence
the main inca force which had retained their weapons but remained about quarter of a league outside cajamarca scattered in confusion as the survivors of those who had accompanied atahualpa fled from the square breaking down a fifteen foot length of wall in the process
atahualpa s warriors were veterans of his recent northern campaigns and constituted the professional core of the inca army seasoned warriors who outnumbered the spaniards more than to to
however the shock of the spanish attack coupled with the spiritual significance of losing the sapa inca and most of his commanders in one blow apparently shattered the army s morale throwing its ranks into terror and initiating a massive rout
there is no evidence that any of the main inca force attempted to engage the spaniards in cajamarca after the success of the initial ambush
atahualpa s wife year old cuxirimay ocllo was with the army and stayed with him while he was imprisoned
following his execution she was taken to cuzco and took the name do a angelina
by she was pizarro s mistress bearing him two sons juan and francisco
following his assassination in she married the interpreter juan de betanzos who later wrote narratives of the incas part one covering inca history up to the arrival of the spanish and part two covering the conquest to mainly from the inca viewpoint and including mentions of interviews with inca guards who were near atahualpa s litter when he was captured
only the first unpublished chapters of part one were known until the complete manuscript was found and published in
