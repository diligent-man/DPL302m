donald s
lopez jr a professor of buddhist and tibetan studies at the university of michigan called frauwallner one of the great buddhist scholars of this the twentieth century
frauwallner was a willing nazi party member in vienna from onwards
he benefitted professionally and personally from his nazi party membership
he was only ousted from his university position after the downfall of nazi germany in
questions have been raised concerning the appropriateness of his later reinstatement at vienna university which form part of the larger and ongoing question of austria s cultural processing of the nazi elements of its past
the question for the history of scholarship is to what extent did his nazi beliefs impact on his indological scholarship and his views about the history of indian philosophy this question has been taken up by professors karin preisendanz and eli franco and others
the general conclusion is that there are aspects of frauwallner s history of philosophy that are untrustworthy because of his racist presuppositions and especially his tendency to consider that thinkers may never change their minds and to see philosophical viewpoints as arising out of soil and blood in an essentialist manner
frauwallner also tended to construct historical narratives using the nineteenth century concept of degeneration to argue that simple original pure forms of philosophy gradually changed into more complex degenerate forms identifying complexity with decadence
such a priori interpretative schemes are no longer acceptable in the contemporary academy
other parts of his work are still useful today such as his work on reconstructing the text of the v davidhi
