Wallingford w l f rd is an historic market town and civil parish located between Oxford and Reading on the River Thames in England Although belonging to the historic county of Berkshire it is within the ceremonial county of Oxfordshire for administrative purposes since as a result of the Local Government Act Wallingford is miles km north of Reading miles km south of Oxford and miles km north west of Henley on Thames The town's population was in the census
The town has played an important role in English history starting with the surrender of Stigand to William the Conqueror in which led to his taking the throne and the creation of Wallingford Castle The castle and the town enjoyed royal status and flourished for much of the Middle Ages The Treaty of Wallingford which ended a civil war known as The Anarchy between King Stephen and Empress Matilda was signed there The town then entered a period of decline after the arrival of the Black Death and falling out of favour with the Tudor monarchs before being called on once again during the English Civil War Wallingford held out as the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Berkshire before surrendering after a week siege Fearing that Wallingford Castle could be used in a future uprising Oliver Cromwell ordered its destruction
Since then Wallingford has become a market town and centre of local commerce At the centre of the town is a market square with the war memorial and Wallingford Town Hall to the south the Corn Exchange theatre to the east and numerous shops around the edges Off the square there are alleyways and streets with more shops and a number of historic inns Although it was a small town Wallingford once had churches now there are three ancient churches within the Parish of St Mary le More and St Leonard a modern Roman Catholic church a Quaker Meeting House dating from and Baptist Methodist and community churches
Wallingford developed around an important crossing point of the River Thames There is evidence of Roman activity in the area who have left traces of occupation burials roads coins and pottery The place name 'Wallingford' is first attested in a Saxon charter of where it appears as W lingford It appears as Welingaford circa and as Walingeford in the Domesday Book of The name means 'the ford of Wealh's people'
The Anglo Saxons built the first settlement Wallingford has been fortified since the Anglo Saxon period when it was an important fortified borough of Wessex with the right to mint royal coinage It was enclosed with substantial earthworks by King Alfred the Great in the ninth century as part of a network of fortified towns known as burhs or burghs to protect Wessex against the Vikings These defences can still be clearly discerned as a group of four roughly square areas around the centre of the town and are well preserved Wallingford became the chief town of Berkshire and the seat of the county's Ealdorman
During the Norman conquest in the Anglo Saxon lord Wigod allowed William the Conqueror's invading armies into Wallingford to rest and to cross the Thames unopposed It is in Wallingford that Stigand the Archbishopric of Canterbury surrendered and submitted to William thereby all but ending opposition to William's ascent to the throne From Wallingford William with Stigand and his armies rode east to Berkhamsted where he received the final surrender from Edgar and the rest of the English leadership before marching on London for his coronation on Christmas Day At that time the river at Wallingford was the lowest point at which the river could be forded The town subsequently stood in high favour with the Normans The Domesday Book of lists Wallingford as one of only towns in the kingdom with a population of over people Wallingford Castle was built soon afterward on the orders of William and became a key strategic centre controlling the Thames crossing and surrounding area
Wallingford Priory also known as Holy Trinity Priory is believed to have stood on the site of the Bull Croft recreation ground off the High Street This Benedictine priory was established on land granted to St Albans Abbey in by Henry I and Geoffrey the Chamberlain gave the priory to St Albans Paul th Abbot of St Albans who sent some of his monks to establish a cell there Wallingford Priory produced the mathematician Richard of Wallingford and the chronicler John of Wallingford
Wallingford provided refuge for the Empress Matilda's party during the civil war that began after her father Henry I's death After the fall of Oxford Castle to Stephen in Matilda fled to Wallingford according to some historic accounts in the snow under a moonlit sky Wallingford Castle was besieged unsuccessfully a number of times with the Treaty of Wallingford ending the conflict there in November
The town was granted a Royal Charter in by the new king Henry II being the second town in England to receive one
During Prince John's unsuccessful revolt against his brother King Richard I whilst Richard was involved with the Third Crusade John seized Wallingford Castle in The rebellion failed and John was forced to return the castle to the king's administrators
King John reclaimed the castle after his inheriting the crown in John modernised fortified and greatly enlarged the Castle and used it extensively during the First Barons' War
The castle was a regular royal residence until the Black Death arrived in at least a third of the townspeople died and only four churches were left in use The castle declined subsequently much stone being removed to renovate Windsor Castle
The road from London to Gloucestershire passed through Wallingford and the town flourished as a trading centre throughout most of the Middle Ages The road was diverted and a bridge was constructed at Abingdon The opening of Abingdon Bridge and loss of traffic that the road had brought caused the town to enter a steep economic decline
In Wallingford and its castle was granted to Catherine of Valois widowed Queen of Henry V Catherine lived at Wallingford with her son Henry VI who was tutored there While she lived at Wallingford Catherine met Owen Tudor whom she later married in secret Catherine and Owen's eldest son Edmund Tudor fathered Henry VII who defeated Richard III at Bosworth Field and founded the Tudor Dynasty
One of the last documented uses of Wallingford as a royal residence was during Letters between Cardinal Wolsey and his secretary Richard Pace discuss King Henry VIII's dissatisfaction with Wallingford and his desire to move on The priory was dissolved in by Cardinal Wolsey partly in order to fund the building of the Cardinal College in Oxford Henry VIII separated the Honour of Wallingford which included rights of control over the town and its castle from the Duchy of Cornwall in
He combined it with the Honour of Ewelme which included the rights over his existing residence and lands at Ewelme Ewelme is six miles from Wallingford so this was done to consolidate control in the area In return Henry transferred as compensation several areas of Cornish property into the Duchy of Cornwall for Prince Edward After taking control of Wallingford in King Henry VIII did not favour choosing Wallingford Castle as an official residence Instead he opted to transfer materials from it to Windsor to enlarge improve his own castle there This practice of dismantling Wallingford Castle to improve Windsor Castle was continued in the reigns of Edward VI Mary I Elizabeth I
Maintenance and repair of Wallingford Castle during the English Civil War was vital to the success of the Royalists' plans The royal headquarters were in Oxford which made the defence of Wallingford which controlled the area to the south especially strategically important In August Colonel Blagge was granted warrants from the King and Prince Rupert to collect taxes from Reading and other local towns in order to proceed with the repairs In April the king marched south from Wallingford in order to relieve Reading which was besieged by the Earl of Essex The Parliamentary army was strong and laid siege to Reading using cannons Reading was unable to hold out long enough for the King and Prince Rupert to arrive and break the siege The town surrendered on April with the garrison joining the royal army and together they retreated through Wallingford back to Oxford
In a group of Parliamentary commissioners came to Wallingford in search of an audience with the King Blagge received them with the encounter being recorded as worrying He received them 'not rudely but with haughtiness enough ' sending a troop of horse to escort them as if they had been prisoners High words followed the commissioners feared they might have had their throats cut by the garrison and gladly took their leave of the 'proud governour October was the last time the king and queen visited the town together although they did visit Abingdon staying at Barton Lodge on April It was also the last time that any British king and queen stayed at the castle together owing to its destruction at the end of the war By May the war had turned decidedly against the Royalists in Berkshire and a failure of communications among the commanders left Abingdon open to occupation by the Parliamentarians General Waller took the town and the garrison retreated to Wallingford
After the Second Battle of Newbury on October where neither side had gained a true victory King Charles I retreated through Wallingford on his way to Oxford Although his retreat went initially unchallenged the next day at a meeting of the War Council it was resolved that Cromwell Balfour and Sir Arthur Hesilrige were to be allowed to take cavalry to pursue the King They were too late and by the time they reached Wallingford they found the Royalists had already advanced to Oxford with the castle blocking their path It was annoyance at missing an opportunity to capture the king that led to Cromwell forming his New Model Army
The first assault on the town was led by Colonel Baxter the governor of Reading in However finding that the fortifications exceeded his expectations he retreated quickly to Reading By the end of the situation had worsened with the king's defeat at the Battle of Naseby by General Fairfax By this point Wallingford Faringdon and Donnington were the only strongholds still loyal to the king in the county of Berkshire The king held up at Oxford for the winter with the intention of riding south to relieve and retake positions in Berkshire but the failure of reinforcements to arrive from the west and the imminent threat of siege by General Fairfax forced him to flee north The siege of Wallingford was begun on May by General Fairfax the Parliamentarians laid siege to Oxford on May
Oxford held out until June when the garrison of men including the king's nephews Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice were marched out of the city with full honours Now only Wallingford remained its garrison faithfully holding the town and castle for the king under the leadership of Colonel Blagge However his position was now impossible to hold with the town being blockaded on all sides It was only a matter of time but still Blagge held that he would not surrender without the king's order and even threatened to set fire to the town during a full assault
A Parliamentary special council met and decided that the difficulty of any full assault would cause unacceptable losses Waiting and trying to starve Blagge out would give the king time to build his forces They were also very concerned that they were risking making a martyr of the town to the Royalist cause in Berkshire if the townspeople suffered too much either in a prolonged siege or an assault The council resolved to draw up preferential terms for Wallingford's surrender Initially Blagge refused even these with the same answer that he would need the king's consent to surrender the town However by July with the king's surrender to the Scotch Army and Wallingford now being the only stronghold in Berkshire still loyal to the crown he knew that there would be no relief or reinforcements
The blockade had over time also been tightened and with the prospect of desertion and mutiny from his starving soldiers Blagge was forced to reopen negotiations The terms of Blagge's surrender were drawn up on July General Fairfax respected Blagge as a fellow soldier for his work in resurrecting the castle for the war and for the manner in which he chose to hold for as long as possible instead of surrendering Fairfax therefore still granted Blagge the original favourable terms of surrender he was offered even though the situation had changed The surrender stipulated that the town and its castle would be surrendered to General Fairfax on July and that all of the town's arms ordinance and provisions of war would be handed over to Fairfax
Blagge and his garrison would then be allowed to march out of the town with full honours and allowed to leave with their horses arms and baggage They would then be permitted to march ten miles out of the town before disbanding Blagge was however forced in the end to surrender the castle to General Fairfax early on the th after a mutiny broke out within the garrison Fairfax sent a regiment into the town to restore order and the garrison's exit was made unimpeded Only two castles now remained supporting the royalist cause Raglan and Pendennis and they both fell by August A new governor Evelyn was installed although he petitioned for the immediate destruction of the castle Parliament instead decided to use it for the imprisonment of Presbyterian prisoners after the Prides Purge
Continued turmoil unrest in the country and a fear that the residents of Wallingford were still loyal to the crown caused Oliver Cromwell to fear that Wallingford Castle could again be fortified against him in a future uprising On November the Council of State decided that Wallingford Castle should be forthwith demolished and the workes thereto belonging effectually slighted Materials from the castle were used again for improvement works at Windsor Castle and for the repair and improvement of the church of St Mary le More

Refortified during the English Civil War Wallingford was held as a Royalist stronghold commanded by Colonel Thomas Blagge In General Thomas Fairfax placed Wallingford Castle under siege after weeks during which Oxford fell to Parliamentary forces the castle finally surrendered in July under generous terms for the defenders The risk of civil conflict continued however and Oliver Cromwell decided that it was necessary to slight the castle in as it remained a surprisingly powerful fortress and a continuing threat should any fresh uprising occur
