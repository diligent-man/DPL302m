the vietnamese alphabet vietnamese ch qu c ng script of the national language is the modern latin writing script or writing system for vietnamese
it uses the latin script based on romance languages originally developed by portuguese missionary francisco de pina
the vietnamese alphabet contains letters including seven letters using four diacritics
there are an additional five diacritics used to designate tone as in and
the complex vowel system and the large number of letters with diacritics which can even stack twice on the same letter e g
nh t meaning first makes it easy to distinguish the vietnamese alphabet from other latin scripts
the vietnamese system produces words that have no silent letters with letters and words consistent in how they are read and spoken with rare exceptions
the elaborate use of diacritics produces a highly accurate sound transcription for tonal languages
vietnamese uses all the letters of the iso basic latin alphabet except for f j w and z
these letters are only used to write loanwords languages of other ethnic groups in the country based on vietnamese phonetics to differentiate the meanings or even vietnamese dialects for example dz or z for southerner pronunciation of v in standard vietnamese
in total there are vowels nguy n m and consonants ph m literally extra sound
notes
the vowels in the table are italicized
pronouncing b as b or b and p as p or p is to avoid confusion in some contexts the same for s s m nh n ng heavy and x as x nh light i as i ng n short and y as y d i long
q and q is always followed by u in every word and phrase in vietnamese e g
qu n trousers quy n r to attract etc
the name i c r t for y is from the french name for the letter i grec greek i referring to the letter s origin from the greek letter upsilon
the other obsolete french pronunciations include e and u wi
the vietnamese alphabet does not contain the letters f p p ph j gi w v k p v p or z d t
however these letters are often used for foreign loanwords or may be kept for foreign names
y is most commonly treated as a vowel along with i
i is short i and y is long i
y can have tones as well as other vowels e g
it may also act as a consonant when used after and a
it can sometimes be used to replace i e g
b nh m can also be written b nh m
s and x are similar to each other in sound in vietnamese and can sometimes replace each other e g
s ng x o or s ng s o the alphabet is largely derived from portuguese with major influence from french although the usage of gh and gi was borrowed from italian compare ghetto giuseppe and that for c k qu from greek and latin compare canis kinesis qu v dis mirroring the english usage of these letters compare cat kite queen
the correspondence between the orthography and pronunciation is somewhat complicated
in some cases the same letter may represent several different sounds and different letters may represent the same sound
this is because the orthography was designed centuries ago and the spoken language has changed as shown in the chart directly above that contrasts the difference between middle and modern vietnamese
the letters y and i are mostly equivalent and there is no concrete rule that says when to use one or the other except in sequences like ay and uy i e
tay arm hand is read t j while tai ear is read t j
there have been attempts since the late th century to standardize the orthography by replacing all the vowel uses of y with i the latest being a decision from the vietnamese ministry of education in
these efforts seem to have had limited effect
in textbooks published by nh xu t b n gi o d c publishing house of education y is used to represent i only in sino vietnamese words that are written with one letter y alone diacritics can still be added as in at the beginning of a syllable when followed by as in y m y t after u and in the sequence ay therefore such forms as l and k are not standard though they are much preferred elsewhere
most people and the popular media continue to use the spelling that they are most accustomed to
the uses of the letters i and y to represent the phoneme i can be categorized as standard as used in textbooks published by nh xu t b n gi o d c and non standard as follows
this standard set by nh xu t b n gi o d c is not definite
it is unknown why the literature books use l while the history books use l

notes
the vowel i is
usually written i s s a suffix indicating profession similar to the english suffix er
sometimes written y after h k l m n s t v x m m america
it is always written y when preceded by an orthographic vowel xw n khuy n to advise
at the beginning of a word derived from chinese written as i otherwise w y u to love the vowel is written oo before c or ng since o in that position represents w k o c organ musical k k k nh coong
this generally only occurs in recent loanwords or when representing dialectal pronunciation
similarly the vowel o is written before c or ng ng ngh an h t nh variant of ng w
but unlike oo being frequently used in onomatopoeia transcriptions from other languages and words borrowed from ngh an h t nh dialects such as vo c seems to be used solely to convey the feel of the ngh an h t nh accents

tones are marked in the ipa as suprasegmentals following the phonemic value
some tones are also associated with a glottalization pattern
there are six distinct tones in the standard northern dialect
the first one level tone is not marked and the other five are indicated by diacritics applied to the vowel part of the syllable
the tone names are chosen such that the name of each tone is spoken in the tone it identifies
in the south there is a merging of the h i and ng tones in effect leaving five tones
unmarked vowels are pronounced with a level voice in the middle of the speaking range
the grave accent indicates that the speaker should start somewhat low and drop slightly in tone with the voice becoming increasingly breathy
the hook indicates in northern vietnamese that the speaker should start in the middle range and fall but in southern vietnamese that the speaker should start somewhat low and fall then rise as when asking a question in english
in the north a tilde indicates that the speaker should start mid break off with a glottal stop then start again and rise like a question in tone
in the south it is realized identically to the h i tone
the acute accent indicates that the speaker should start mid and rise sharply in tone
the dot or cross signifies in northern vietnamese that the speaker starts low and fall lower in tone with the voice becoming increasingly creaky and ending in a glottal stopin syllables where the vowel part consists of more than one vowel such as diphthongs and triphthongs the placement of the tone is still a matter of debate
generally there are two methodologies an old style and a new style
while the old style emphasizes aesthetics by placing the tone mark as close as possible to the center of the word by placing the tone mark on the last vowel if an ending consonant part exists and on the next to last vowel if the ending consonant doesn t exist as in h a h y the new style emphasizes linguistic principles and tries to apply the tone mark on the main vowel as in ho hu
in both styles when one vowel already has a quality diacritic on it the tone mark must be applied to it as well regardless of where it appears in the syllable thus thu is acceptable while th is not
in the case of the diphthong the mark is placed on the
the u in qu is considered part of the consonant
currently the new style is usually used in textbooks published by nh xu t b n gi o d c while most people still prefer the old style in casual uses
among overseas vietnamese communities the old style is predominant for all purposes
in lexical ordering differences in letters are treated as primary differences in tone markings as secondary and differences in case as tertiary differences
letters include for instance a and but not
older dictionaries also treated digraphs and trigraphs like ch and ngh as base letters ordering according to primary and secondary differences proceeds syllable by syllable
according to this principle a dictionary lists tu n th before tu n chay because the secondary difference in the first syllable takes precedence over the primary difference in the second syllable
in the past syllables in multisyllabic words were concatenated with hyphens but this practice has died out and hyphenation is now reserved for word borrowings from other languages
a written syllable consists of at most three parts in the following order from left to right
an optional beginning consonant part
a required vowel syllable nucleus and the tone mark if needed applied above or below it
an ending consonant part can only be one of the following c ch m n ng nh p t or nothing since the beginning of the chinese rule bc literature government papers scholarly works and religious scripture were all written in classical chinese ch h n while indigenous writing in chu han started around the ninth century
since the th century several vietnamese words started to be written in ch n m using variant chinese characters each of them representing one word
the system was based on ch h n but was also supplemented with vietnamese invented characters ch thu n n m proper n m characters to represent native vietnamese words
as early as with the work of francisco de pina portuguese and italian jesuit missionaries in vietnam began using latin script to transcribe the vietnamese language as an assistance for learning the language
the work was continued by the avignonese alexandre de rhodes
building on previous dictionaries by gaspar do amaral and antonio barbosa rhodes compiled the dictionarium annamiticum lusitanum et latinum a vietnamese portuguese latin dictionary which was later printed in rome in using their spelling system
these efforts led eventually to the development of the present vietnamese alphabet
for years ch qu c ng was used within the catholic community
in the french colonial administration enforced ch qu c ng
the latin alphabet then became a means to publish vietnamese popular literature which was disparaged as vulgar by the chinese educated imperial elites
historian pamela a
pears asserted that by instituting the latin alphabet in vietnam the french cut the vietnamese from their traditional h n n m literature
an important reason why latin script became the standard writing system of vietnam but did not do so in cambodia and laos that were both dominated by the french for a similar amount of time and existed within the same colonial framework has to do with the fact that the nguy n emperors of vietnam heavily promoted its usage
according to the historian liam kelley in his work emperor th nh th i s educational revolution neither the french nor the revolutionaries had enough power to spread the usage of ch qu c ng down to the village level
it was by imperial decree in of emperor th nh th i that parents could decide whether their children will follow a curriculum in h n v n or nam m southern sound the contemporary vietnamese name for ch qu c ng
this decree was issued at the same time when other social changes such as the cutting of long male hair were occurring
the main reason for the popularisation of the latin alphabet in vietnam i nam during the nguy n dynasty the french protectorates of annam and tonkin was because of the pioneering efforts by intellectuals from french cochinchina combined with the progressive and scientific policies of the french government in french indochina that created the momentum for the usage of ch qu c ng to spread
since the s the vietnamese mostly use ch qu c ng and new vietnamese terms for new items or words are often calqued from h n n m
some french had originally planned to replace vietnamese with french but this never was a serious project given the small number of french settlers compared with the native population
the french had to reluctantly accept the use of ch qu c ng to write vietnamese since this writing system created by portuguese missionaries is based on portuguese orthography not french
between and the short lived tonkin free school promulgated ch qu c ng and taught french language to the general population
in the french system suppressed vietnam s confucian examination system viewed as an aristocratic system linked with the ancient regime thereby forcing vietnamese elites to educate their offspring in the french language education system
emperor kh i nh declared the traditional writing system abolished in
while traditional nationalists favoured the confucian examination system and the use of ch h n vietnamese revolutionaries progressive nationalists and pro french elites viewed the french education system as a means to liberate the vietnamese from old chinese domination and the unsatisfactory outdated confucian examination system to democratize education and to help link vietnamese to european philosophies
the french colonial system then set up another educational system teaching vietnamese as a first language using ch qu c ng in primary school and then the french language taught in ch qu c ng
hundreds of thousands of textbooks for primary education began to be published in ch qu c ng with the unintentional result of turning the script into the popular medium for the expression for vietnamese culture
typesetting and printing vietnamese has been challenging due to its number of accents diacritics
contemporary vietnamese texts sometimes include words which have not been adapted to modern vietnamese orthography especially for documents written in chinese characters
the vietnamese language itself has been likened to a system akin to ruby characters elsewhere in asia

the universal character set unicode has full support for the latin vietnamese writing system although it does not have a separate segment for it
the required characters that other languages use are scattered throughout the basic latin latin supplement latin extended a and latin extended b blocks those that remain such as the letters with more than one diacritic are placed in the latin extended additional block
an ascii based writing convention vietnamese quoted readable and several byte based encodings including vscii tcvn vni viscii and windows were widely used before unicode became popular
most new documents now exclusively use the unicode format utf
unicode allows the user to choose between precomposed characters and combining characters in inputting vietnamese
because in the past some fonts implemented combining characters in a nonstandard way see verdana font most people use precomposed characters when composing vietnamese language documents except on windows where windows used combining characters
most keyboards on modern phone and computer operating systems including ios android and macos have now supported the vietnamese language and direct input of diacritics by default
previously vietnamese users had to manually install free softwares such as unikey on computers or laban key on phones to type vietnamese diacritics
these keyboards support input methods such as telex vni viqr and its variants
