the spanish word maraved is unusual in having three documented plural forms maraved s maraved es and maravedises
the first one is the most straightforward the second is a variant plural formation found commonly in words ending with a stressed whereas the third is the most unusual and the least recommended real academia espa ola s diccionario panhisp nico de dudas labels it vulgar in appearance
the gold dinar was first struck in iberia under abd ar rahman iii emir of c rdoba
during the th century the dinar became known as the morabit morabotin or morabetino throughout europe
in the th century it was copied by the christian rulers sancho i of portugal ferdinand ii of le n and alfonso viii of castile
the new version of the coin became known as the morabitino in the kingdom of portugal and as maraved in the remaining iberian kingdoms
alfonso s gold marabotin or maraved retained inscriptions in arabic but had the letters alf at the bottom
it weighed about grams
in castile the maraved de oro soon became the accounting unit for gold alongside the sueldo from solidus for silver and the dinero from denarius for billon vell n in spanish
the gold content of the maraved fell to a gram during the reign of james i of aragon and it kept falling eventually becoming a silver coin under alfonso x of castile
by this time the word maraved was being used for a specific coin officially for any coin colloquially and as a synonym for money itself resulting in a certain confusion in interpreting th century references to money values and coinage
alfonso x for example made three issues of vell n in each of which the new coin was called a maraved
his basic silver coin of was also called a maraved maraved de plata
it weighed g and contained g of fine silver
it was worth dineros
at that time the money of account was the maraved of sueldos or dineros so that one maraved as an accounting unit was worth six silver maraved coins
the silver maraved money of account represented according to one interpretation about g of silver in
this had fallen to g by to g by and to g in
the gold maraved had disappeared as a money of account by
the maraved de plata silver maraved gradually came to be used as money of account for larger sums for the value of gold coins and for the mint price of silver and eventually it supplanted the sueldo as the main accounting unit
alfonso xi did not call any of his coins a maraved and henceforth the term was used only as a unit of account and not as the name of a coin
in it became the smallest spanish unit of account the thirty fourth part of a real
in the new world nonetheless there are documents which testify to the reduction of their value to less than the thirtieth part of a real
this reduction was on account of the cost and risk of their transportation from spain before the establishment of the first mint houses of mexico and santo domingo
the maraved remained a money of account in spain until
after spain s discovery of the americas copper maraved s along with silver reales were the first coins struck in spain for the purpose of circulation in the new world colonies
these coins minted with a special design for specific use of the americas were first coined in seville in for shipment to the colonial island of hispaniola the following year thus giving these coins their distinction as the first coins for the new world
by these coins were still being minted by now in both seville and burgos
these maraved s were used as spanish colonial change for smaller transactions and after mints were later established in the new world in both mexico ordered in production began in and santo domingo ordered in production began in coins of this type were also minted there
