The French East India Company French Compagnie fran aise pour le commerce des Indes orientales was a colonial commercial enterprise founded on September to compete with the English later British and Dutch trading companies in the East Indies
Planned by Jean Baptiste Colbert it was chartered by King Louis XIV for the purpose of trading in the Eastern Hemisphere It resulted from the fusion of three earlier companies the Compagnie de Chine the Compagnie d'Orient and Compagnie de Madagascar The first Director General for the Company was Fran ois de la Faye who was adjoined by two Directors belonging to the two most successful trading organizations at that time Fran ois Caron who had spent years working for the Dutch East India Company including more than years in Japan and Marcara Avanchintz an Armenian trader from Isfahan Persia
In French king Henry IV authorized the first Compagnie des Indes Orientales granting the firm a year monopoly of the Indies trade This precursor to Colbert's later Compagnie des Indes Orientales however was not a joint stock corporation and was funded by the Crown The seventeenth century was littered with failed French efforts to settle and trade in the East Indies They were influenced by the successful trading of the Dutch in Asia During the time between s and early s French efforts were smaller in scale but they enjoyed success French vessels traversed the Persian Gulf Red Sea and northwestern coast of the Indian subcontinent These accomplishments paled France in comparison with England and Dutch Republic France's Atlantic ports pursued to compete and amalgamate with each other The commercial and capital expertise was disbursed around the coastal regions of Brittany and Normandy
The initial capital of the revamped Compagnie des Indes Orientales was million livres divided into shares of livres apiece Louis XIV funded the first million livres of investment against which losses in the first years were to be charged The initial stock offering quickly sold out as courtiers of Louis XIV recognized that it was in their interests to support the King's overseas initiative The Compagnie des Indes Orientales was granted a year monopoly on French trade in the Indian and Pacific Oceans a region stretching from the Cape of Good Hope to the Straits of Magellan The French monarch also granted the Company a concession in perpetuity for the island of Madagascar as well as any other territories it could conquer The company possessed greater resources and better political banking than France's previous ventures in the Indian Ocean Colbert's obsession with VOC led to series of early letdowns One of France's main aims was to establish a French entrep t in Madagascar to rival the Dutch colony of Batavia
By the s the company went insolvent and they had little choice but to rent out its monopoly to a group of merchants The Indian trade remained under the company for approximately thirty years In Scottish financier John Law arrived at the French court The French court were in deep misery and were impotent to cover their debts caused due to War of Spanish Succession Law approached the Crown with a scheme to construct a national bank and introduce paper currency which would facilitate France's shift to credit economy
The Company failed to found a successful colony on Madagascar but was able to establish ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon and le de France today's R union and Mauritius By it had established itself in India but the firm was near bankruptcy In the same year the Compagnie des Indes Orientales was combined under the direction of John Law with other French trading companies to form the Compagnie Perp tuelle des Indes The French economy crashed drastically in due to Law's reforms Following this event the company again started trading and settling in India The reorganized corporation resumed its operating independence in
The company's interest in the Mughal Empire was to prove no easier The French arrived at the Indian subcontinent decades after the English Portuguese and Dutch in establishing trade in India On September the French secured a royal mandate from Emperor Aurangzeb that granted them to trade on the port of Surat By the French had directed their attention toward the prominent site of Pondicherry however the shift did little to offset the Company's chronic shortage of capital With the decline of the Mughal Empire the French decided to intervene in Indian political affairs to protect their interests notably by forging alliances with local rulers in south India From the French under Joseph Fran ois Dupleix pursued an aggressive policy against both the Indians and the British until they ultimately were defeated by Robert Clive Several Indian trading ports including Pondich ry and Chandernagore remained under French control until
France's main rivalry came from the British As a result of constant wars in Europe notably the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War the British were able to exert control over French territories in India With the Treaty of Paris in the territories were returned to France The Company was not able to maintain itself financially and it was abolished in King Louis XVI issued a edict that required the Company to transfer to the state all its properties assets and rights which were valued at million livres The King agreed to pay all of the Company's debts and obligations though holders of Company stock and notes received only an estimated percent of the face value of their investments by the end of corporate liquidation in
The company was reconstituted in and issued shares of stock priced at livres apiece It was given monopoly on all trade with countries beyond the Cape of Good Hope for an agreed period of seven years The agreement however did not anticipate the French Revolution and on April the monopoly was abolished by an act of the new French Assembly which enthusiastically declared that the lucrative Far Eastern trade would henceforth be thrown open to all Frenchmen The company accustomed neither to competition nor official disfavor fell into steady decline and was finally liquidated in
Even as the company was headed consciously toward extinction it became embroiled in its most infamous scandal The Committee of Public Safety had banned all joint stock companies on August and specifically seized the assets and papers of the East India Company While its liquidation proceedings were being set up directors of the company bribed various senior state officials to allow the company to carry out its own liquidation rather than be supervised by the government When this became known the following year the resulting scandal led to the execution of key Montagnard deputies like Fabre d' glantine and Joseph Delaunay among others The infighting sparked by the episode also brought down Georges Danton and can be said to have led to the downfall of the Montagnards as a whole
