The channel's annual budget for was £ billion It is funded by the television licence fee together with the BBC's other domestic television stations and shows uninterrupted programming without commercial advertising The television channel had the highest reach share of any broadcaster in the United Kingdom as at ahead of its traditional rival for ratings leadership ITV In a major global study of the BBC by the Populus polling organisation found BBC One to be rated the highest quality TV channel in the world with BBC Two coming in third place
The BBC began its own regular television programming from the basement of Broadcasting House London on August The channel officially began regular broadcasts on November from a converted wing of the Alexandra Palace in London
On September two days before Britain declared war on Germany the station was taken off air with little warning with the last programme to be shown being a Mickey Mouse cartoon the short Mickey's Gala Premier the government was concerned that the VHF transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft that could bomb London
BBC Television returned on June at three o'clock in the afternoon Jasmine Bligh one of the original announcers made the first announcement saying Good afternoon everybody How are you Do you remember me Jasmine Bligh Twenty minutes later BBC Television again aired the Mickey Mouse cartoon that they had broadcast in
The BBC held a statutory monopoly on television broadcasting in the United Kingdom until ITV the first Independent Television station began to broadcast on September The competition quickly forced the channel to change its identity and priorities following a large reduction in its audience as noted in the Pilkington Report on the future of broadcasting Simultaneously the Pilkington Report decided to award a third television station to the BBC on the basis that ITV was in comparison lacking in serious programming
BBC Television became BBC when BBC launched on April transmitting an incompatible line image on UHF The only way to receive all channels was to use a complex dual standard and line receiver with both a VHF and a UHF aerial line only sets became obsolete in when transmission with standard converters ended BBC moved to purpose built facilities at Television Centre on September Television News continued to use Alexandra Palace as its base and by early had even converted one of its studios to colour In the weeks leading up to November BBC unofficially transmitted the occasional programme in its new colour system in order to test it At midnight on November simultaneously with ITV and two years after BBC had done so BBC officially began line PAL colour programming on UHF with a broadcast of a concert by Petula Clark Colour transmissions could be received in monochrome via monochrome line sets until the end of analogue broadcasting

On December the BBC announced plans to introduce a new breakfast television service to compete with TV am They stated that the new show would be broadcast before TV am but included the caveat that the new show would not launch until at least November whereupon new licence fee income could finance the necessary extension of broadcasting hours On January one year after originally planned the first edition of Breakfast Time was shown on BBC becoming the first UK wide breakfast television service and continued to lead in the ratings until
In Bill Cotton become managing director of Television at the BBC and set about overhauling BBC which had been slated with poor home grown shows its heavy reliance on US imports with Dallas and The Thorn Birds being BBC's highest rated programmes and ratings being over behind ITV Cotton recruited Michael Grade to become Controller of BBC from September the first time the corporation had recruited someone outside of the BBC replacing Alan Hart who had been criticised for his lack of knowledge in general entertainment as he was head of BBC Sport prior to
The first major overhaul was to axe the unpopular Sixty Minutes current affairs programme this was a replacement for the news and magazine show Nationwide Its replacement was the BBC Six O'Clock News a straight news programme in a bid to shore up its failing early evening slot It was believed the BBC were planning to cut short the evening news and move more light entertainment programming in from the slot but this was dismissed The Miss Great Britain contest was dropped being described as verging on the too offensive after the January contest with World's Strongest Man and International Superstar also being cancelled
BBC was relaunched on February with a new look new programming including Wogan EastEnders and a revised schedule to help streamline and maintain viewers throughout the course of the evening Grade started to gear most programmes to either on the hour or half past the hour while Panorama and Omnibus were both moved after the Nine O'Clock News Grade was also determined to end the dated and inept BBC scheduling which was hampering the network and holding back good programmes Grade stated When I took over BBC I discovered there were wonderful things it was just a case of where to put them Wogan had been scheduled for a pm slot but Grade moved it to a pm slot as he believed the show had potential
From February to August a high number of American mini series were broadcast while filming took place of a number of new home grown programmes including 'Allo 'Allo In Sickness and in Health and Open All Hours Further improvement came about when the corporation strengthened its drama output costing £ million with eight new series including Howards' Way All Creatures Great and Small Hold the Back Page and Bluebill along with the return of Bergerac and Big Deal The increase in the drama department was achieved by switching the money away from the administrative service over a three year period after BBC was criticised for failing in matching ITV's output in drama EastEnders was moved to a slot where it managed to soar to million helping the BBC audience share increase to nearly for the first time since
On February Doctor Who was placed on an month hiatus The BBC originally planned to axe the series as they wished to spend its budgets on new programming for the channel but was forced to back down from public pressure and Doctor Who returned in September At the time Michael Grade and Jonathan Powell were blamed for the decision Grade was the target of death threats but it was later revealed that the decision was taken due to the series running out of creative inspiration making it impossible to find anyone at the time who knew what to do with the series
On September the long standing children's programming block was overhauled and rebranded as Children's BBC which gave it dedicated idents for the first time and had a live in vision presenter similar to rival ITV's Children's ITV block which had been running since January Previously the BBC had broadcast children's programming using BBC's team of regular duty announcers The launch presenter for this block and thus the first Children's BBC presenter of the current format was Phillip Schofield
On May long running lunchtime magazine show Pebble Mill at One was broadcast for the last time after being on air for years On October BBC launched its daytime television schedules In a statement BBC Daytime head Roger Laughton said
Stereo audio transmissions using the NICAM digital stereo sound format began on BBC in late to coincide with the sale of the first consumer NICAM enabled equipment a year after BBC and were gradually phased in across BBC TV output although it took until August for the service to begin officially on both channels During this time both commercial analogue broadcasters ITV and Channel had officially begun stereo transmissions using the BBC developed NICAM system Widescreen programming was introduced on digital platforms in
For the first years of its existence with the exception of films and programmes purchased from the United States and elsewhere almost all the channel's output were produced by the BBC's in house production departments This changed following the passing of the Broadcasting Act which required that of the BBC's television output be out sourced to independent production companies By many popular BBC One shows were made for the channel by independents but the in house production departments continued to contribute heavily to the schedule
In March as part of the £ million programme package for spring and summer line up on BBC it was announced an extra £ million was to be spent on rejuvenating the channels drama and comedy output during peak times to keep the channel in a healthy state once the new Channel licences were awarded
In December Wogan was to be cancelled due to falling ratings against a number of ITV shows in which Wogan only managed six million viewers compared to double that for This Is Your Life The Krypton Factor and The Question Additionally an extra £ million a year was spent on narrowing the gap on ITV's ratings lead since a few months prior to this the channel had been criticised for its Autumn schedule having tired formats uninspiring scheduling of new programmes and poor scripts Wogan was replaced with Eldorado in early July but this was itself cancelled a year later
Alan Yentob launched the Autumn schedule calling it My first try with a lot of help from my friends with the channel still under criticism following the start of new programming which Alan introduced a year earlier and the number of summer repeats £ million was spent on hours of original drama produced enchantment to the arts with an extended week run for Omnibus and documentaries with The Downing Street Years new wildlife series and an eight month look at Sheffield's Children's hospital while Goodnight Sweetheart Grace Favour and The Danny Baker Show were new comedy series Lois Clark The New Adventures of Superman included in the Saturday night line up to increase variety
Following the public disapproval of filling its schedule with of repeats during the summer months of BBC agreed to broadcast an extra hours worth of original programming over the same period during the summer in which included giving EastEnders an additional episode per week Efficiency savings of £ million were found and redeployed to the new productions The savings were seen as a vindication for the producer choice and the controversial market oriented drive introduced in April
By March the channel admitted defeat in its ratings war with ITV with its Spring line up emphasising more on serious factual and educational programmes and drama This change in strategy came about after continuing complaints that the channel was appealing to the lowest common denominator to increase viewership Reliance on docusoaps and the dropping of the vilified Noel's House Party were chastened by the hoax guests on The Vanessa Show Alan Yentob said The spring package is to remind people of what the BBC is here for range and ambition you won't find anywhere else at peak time The changes helped the channel distinguish itself from as one BBC executive said its down market rival and would not compete for viewers on ITV's terms
Lorraine Heggessey became Controller of BBC One a post she took up on November She had previously been sounded out about the job in after Michael Jackson's departure but had turned down the opportunity as she felt she was then not yet experienced enough
During Heggessey's five years in charge BBC One's audience share fell by to although this was in the context of declining audience figures across all British television channels due to increased competition from multichannel digital television However in BBC One overtook its main rival ITV in terms of annual audience share for the first time since the rival channel had launched in although much of this was down to the success of the channel's daytime television line up which had its own Controller Jane Lush
When Heggessey arrived at the channel in November she inherited two controversial schedule changes which had been implemented the previous month at the behest of Director General of the BBC Greg Dyke the Nine O'Clock News had been moved to the later time of and Panorama moved from Monday night prime time slot to a later slot on Sunday nights The moving of Panorama attracted criticism that BBC One was sidelining serious programming in favour of more populist output Heggessey publicly defended the decision despite it not being hers claiming that Panorama's ratings would have dwindled in its previous slot
Heggessey and the BBC's Controller of Drama Commissioning Jane Tranter took advantage of the weekday slot opening up by moving the news to commission new popular drama output such as the successful Waking the Dead and Spooks Celebrity dancing show Strictly Come Dancing present was also a popular success on Saturday nights although another Saturday night entertainment series Fame Academy faced accusations of being too derivative of the output of commercial rivals and during Heggessey's era the channel frequently came under attack for being too populist and not providing enough serious programming
Immediately after her arrival Heggessey ordered a review of the Balloon idents the channel had been using for its between programme idents since In her opinion the balloon was slow and distant and so on March after much speculation she took the decision to abandon the Balloon idents and the traditional Globe idents the channel had used in a variety of forms since They were replaced by a new style of on air identity for the channel the Rhythm Movement idents The new idents attracted criticism for going against the traditions of the channel and pandering to political correctness as they featured activities performed by people of various ethnicities The abandonment of a station clock and perceived lack of a 'serious ident' also put the BBC in an embarrassing situation just one day into the new look with the death of the Queen Mother
One of Heggessey's most notable decisions and last major success at the channel was the recommissioning of the science fiction drama series Doctor Who which had been a popular hit in previous decades but ceased production in Heggessey and Jane Tranter recommissioned the series in September after Heggessey had spent two years persuading the BBC's commercial arm BBC Worldwide to abandon their attempts to make a feature film version of the programme and allow it to instead return it to BBC One The new version of Doctor Who present debuted on March and became a critical and popular hit with Paul Hoggart of The Times newspaper describing the series as a joyful exuberant reinvention and a fine legacy from Ms Heggessey
Heggessey did later concede in a interview with The Independent newspaper that arts programming had suffered a cutback under her control of BBC One However she did respond to this omission following criticism from the Board of Governors of the BBC by commissioning programmes such as the arts documentary series Imagine present and A Picture of Britain
On February it was announced that Lorraine Heggessey was to leave the BBC to take up the post of Chief Executive at production company Talkback Thames She left on April Five months after her departure BBC One was named Channel of the Year at the Edinburgh Television Festival primarily on the strength of Heggessey's commissions such as Strictly Come Dancing and Doctor Who
Joining the channel as Controller in Peter Fincham oversaw the commissioning of several successful BBC One programmes including Robin Hood Jane Eyre and How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria which was followed by similar shows Any Dream Will Do and I'd Do Anything because of its success His first full year in charge of the channel saw a year on year growth in the audience share with a rise from in August to in August
Fincham also directly initiated the creation of both The One Show present an early evening current affairs and lifestyle magazine programme which now runs all but two weeks of the year and Davina a prime time chat show the latter hosted by Davina McCall who presented Big Brother However Davina was a critical and ratings disaster which Fincham subsequently admitted was personally his fault although he defended the strategy of experimenting with the BBC One schedule This he continued in January when he moved the current affairs series Panorama from its Sunday night slot back to the prime time Monday evening slot from which it had been removed in most likely in response to a demand from the Board of Governors of the BBC for the channel to show more current affairs programming in prime time
Fincham's judgement was again called into question this time by The Telegraph for his decision to spend £ million replacing the channel's 'Rhythm and Movement' idents which had been introduced by his predecessor Lorraine Heggessey several years earlier with the 'Circle' idents a set of eight ten second films some of which were shot abroad in locations such as Mexico and Croatia Fincham later found himself having to publicly defend the £ million salary that the BBC paid Jonathan Ross in although Ross's BBC One work—primarily consisting of Friday Night with Jonathan Ross—formed only part of his overall BBC commitment
The channel was named Channel of the Year at the Broadcast Awards
Following its rebrand in March BBC One launched The One to Watch campaign during which animated blocks created the word The and moved into the BBC logo
Each new campaign incorporating the theme retained the same animated sequence
In May Fincham took the decision to drop Neighbours an Australian soap opera from BBC One after years on the channel when its producers Freemantle Media significantly raised the price they wanted the BBC to pay for it in a bidding war Fincham commented that it was 'a big loss' but that BBC One would not pay 'the best part of £ million' Neighbours left the channel after the BBC's contract to show the programme ended on February and moved to Channel on February The Weakest Link was moved from BBC Two to fill the gap with the afternoon CBBC slot moving minutes earlier
There was further controversy in July when Fincham was accused of misleading BBC One viewers The incident involved a clip from forthcoming documentary A Year with the Queen which was shown to journalists during a press conference It apparently showed the Queen storming out of a session with American photographer Annie Leibovitz over a disagreement about what she should wear but the BBC subsequently admitted that the scenes used in the trailer had been edited out of their correct order meaning that a false impression was given Fincham admitted the error but rejected calls that he should resign from his position as a result His future was deemed uncertain following critical comments from Sir Michael Lyons Chairman of the BBC Trust and he resigned on October
In a report published by the BBC Trust found scheduling changes had led to a decrease in viewers This was especially noticeable for Blue Peter and Newsround two of CBBC's flagship programmes Blue Peter which recorded its lowest viewing numbers since it started in and Newsround with fewer than viewers compared to in
As part of the Delivering Quality First proposals submitted by the BBC in October and approved by the BBC Trust in May all children's programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only it was made clear Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere Children's programming on BBC One ended on December The move was criticised by Teletubbies co creator Anne Wood who described the changes as ghettoising children's programmes and believe it was merely a cost cutting measure Wood said On the one hand it is inevitable But it is dismissive of children There is a certain amount of overlooking of the fact that children's programmes do get a wider audience than people are aware of I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do A lot of the reason older people like to watch children's programming is because it is life enhancing Head of BBC Children's Joe Godwin said Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes Far from being a 'cynical' move we're just following where our audience has already gone
As part of the review in other changes were brought in including
BBC One is reducing the minimum hours of arts and music from to achieved through cutting episodes of shows in particular Film
BBC One and Two will largely be protected from making significant cuts
Repeats on BBC One will increase but remain under of all output the current rate is

On October the BBC announced plans to launch a one hour time shift of the channel named BBC One + The channel would have replaced BBC Three in However on June the BBC Trust rejected the plans for a BBC One + channel as they stated that it would be at the expense of commercial rivals

BBC One HD at launch did not offer regional variations and therefore the channel could not broadcast during regional programming slots most noticeably the local news programmes The BBC Trust admitted that this was due to technical and financial constraints but the BBC announced on June that the national variations of BBC One Northern Ireland BBC One Scotland and BBC One Wales would become available from On October Northern Ireland received the first variation A Scottish variation launched on January followed by a Welsh variation on January Unlike BBC One HD which is capable of broadcasting audio content in full DTS BBC One Wales HD and BBC One Northern Ireland HD are both currently only broadcasting audio in PCM stereo even when programming is otherwise identical to that of BBC One HD On July the BBC indicated that it also wants to launch regional variants of BBC One HD across England however this would require the approval of the BBC Trust with a proposal due to be presented within six months On November the Northern Irish regional variant of BBC One HD was swapped with the SD channel on Sky's EPG for HD subscribers This was followed by the Welsh and Scottish variants on December On March BBC One Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland HD launched on Freesat Sky and Virgin Media outside the regions they were originally seen in
