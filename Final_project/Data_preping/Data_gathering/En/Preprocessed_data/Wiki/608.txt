evarts attended boston latin school then yale college
in his college class were morrison waite later chief justice of the united states samuel j
tilden future new york governor and democratic presidential nominee and one of the contestants in the electoral commissions controversy in which evarts acted as counsel for the republicans chemist benjamin silliman jr and edwards pierrepont later united states attorney general
while at yale he became a member of two secret societies the literary and debate oriented linonian society and skull and bones he later extolled the former and much later denounced all such secret societies
evarts was one of the founders of yale literary magazine in
he graduated third in his class in
after college he moved to windsor vermont where he studied law in the office of horace everett and taught school to save money for law school
he attended harvard law school for a year where he won the respect of professors joseph story and simon greenleaf evarts completed his legal studies under attorney daniel lord of new york city and was admitted to the bar in
he married helen minerva bingham wardner in
she was the daughter of allen wardner a prominent businessman and banker who served as vermont state treasurer
they had children between and all born in new york city
after admission to the bar evarts joined the law office of daniel lord
one of his first cases involved the trial of the infamous forger monroe edwards
evarts served as a junior counsel for the defense which was headed by senator john j
crittenden of kentucky
edwards was convicted but evarts s handling of his duties earned him notice as a promising lawyer
in evarts began his partnership with charles f
southmayd the firm was then named butler evarts southmayd a partnership that would last for the rest of his professional career in one form or the other
in evarts invited joseph hodges choate to join the firm which then became evarts southmayd choate and the firm then had a trial litigator in many ways as talented as evarts
but it was southmayd that evarts depended on to prepare the case because southmayd it was said was a lawyer of remarkable knowledge and capacity and dexterity in working up a case in court especially before a jury however it was evarts who shined
in the state of virginia hired attorneys including the eminent charles o conor to contest the decision of the new york superior court releasing eight black slaves in the famous lemmon slave case
when ogden hoffman the new york attorney general died the new york legislature appointed evarts to replace him and he argued to uphold the decision
the appellate division affirmed the ruling and virginia again appealed
evarts again represented the state in the new york court of appeals and again prevailed
the case generated widespread interest in both new york and the southern states and evarts s arguments were reported in the daily press as was nearly every step in the case
thurlow weed said that the quality of evarts s arguments placed beyond doubt his right to be ranked among the foremost lawyers of the country
in evarts represented the widow of henry parish who was the proponent of his will and codicils in probate
his brothers contested the will on the grounds of incapacity and undue influence
the brothers had been the decedent s executor in the will but by a codicil executed after he was struck with paralysis that rendered him nearly speechless they were removed the proceedings took on a bleak house like life of its own the dickens novel having been published only three years before with eminent counsel on all sides
the estate was worth over million at the beginning of the trial
there were days of testimony before the surrogate and two weeks of oral argument before the case closed on november
the surrogate admitted the will and the first codicil removing the brothers as executors and bequeathing them the residue of the estate but rejected the second and third providing for in charitable bequests
after four and a half years of appeal involving two arguments before the court of appeals the judgment was affirmed
the times concluded the three volumes of evidence reveal a web of fact experience and motive rarely matched in works of fiction and the three remaining volumes of briefs and arguments exhibit an array of learning ingenuity and sustained ability that will always place this suit in the front rank of the causes c l bres of american jurisprudence as a result of this case his firm would be entrusted with many large estates including that of the astors
the most fame evarts ever received for a case however came in when he represented nationally famous clergyman henry ward beecher in a suit for unlawful conversation unlawful sexual intercourse by beecher with the wife of plaintiff theodore tilton and the alienation of his wife s affections
the case was a national sensation but despite what appeared to be clear evidence evarts obtained a hung jury for his client in fact only three of the twelve jurors voted in favor of tilton
evarts s courtroom style was summarized as follows h is long sentences which in the period when he was most conspicuous in the public mind were often marveled over never seemed to impair the clarity of his arguments the vein of humor he could infuse in the driest case the logic and vigor of his utterances the soundness of his information the great thoroughness of his preparation were all factors in his success
but of course these do not account altogether for his triumph as an advocate which was largely due to his positive genius for that kind of work another observer described his style

in he received the appointment of assistant united states attorney for the district of new york
he served until
in he was also made a commissioner of the almshouse later known as the commissioners of charity and correction

o sullivan and his fellow filibusters who had fitted out the cleopatra to aid an insurrection in cuba

douglas
he was not involved in the antislavery crusade except for his involvement in the lemmon slave case
evarts never showed the talent or inclination for electoral politics but he early became relied on by party leaders to perform oratorical or public ceremonial functions
in early he made two major addresses at large meetings for daniel webster s candidacy one in march at the metropolitan hall and the other in june at constitution hall right before the whig national convention
evarts s allegiance was out of touch not only with both the northern and southern factions of the whigs but also with william h
seward who supported general winfield scott
although most former webster supporters belonged to the whiggish aligned moderate wing of the republican party and senator william h
seward on the staunchly abolitionist end evarts became an enthusiastic supporter of seward
in he was chairman of the new york delegation to the republican national convention in chicago where his oratory was at the disposal of the senator who most observers believed was a strong favorite for the nomination
james g
blaine described the effects of those efforts on his audience
evarts placed seward s name in nomination and when it became apparent that seward would not attain it evarts on behalf of seward graciously moved the unanimous nomination of abraham lincoln
