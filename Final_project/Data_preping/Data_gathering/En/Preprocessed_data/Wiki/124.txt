mulford bateman foster december august was a botanist known by many as the father of the bromeliad as he was instrumental in the discovery and introduction of many new species of bromeliad to the united states
he also devoted his life to hybridizing and contributed widely to the knowledge of the plant species
he was a man of many talents including naturalist explorer writer photographer artist horticulturist and a well respected landscape architect in florida
numerous bromeliad plants found today are named after various foster family members and the genus fosterella is named in honor of his work
he was born in elmer new jersey to samuel preston foster editor of the elmer times and fannie bateman a housewife with a green thumb and artistic leanings
he grew up exploring the woods around his new jersey home under the guidance of his mother
with her inspiration mulford grew up making his own small gardens with the wild plants that he had gathered
he eventually started collecting snakes lizards and other reptiles whenever he could
he attended school and graduated in as salutatorian from elmer high school spending his free time out of doors
mulford s father encouraged him to become educated in business being concerned that his love of nature would not be profitable
to satisfy this urging he attended and graduated from a philadelphia business school
he worked for years in the top philadelphia banks during this training and in the year following graduation
in he decided to leave philadelphia and took a job with his father s newspaper as associate editor back in elmer nj
but within a year he was back in philadelphia
after his marriage he and his wife purchased land north of harrisburg pennsylvania at cold springs
it was a large tract of land
mulford and fridel lived in a multi story home with the basement and an outbuilding devoted to his snakes
it was remote connected to services only by a train with a depot near their house and walking path
he had plans of refurbishing one of the old farmhouses on the property although this never transpired
according to historians the farmhouse likely burned down sometime in and the family left cold springs sometime after this
during his years at cold springs mulford kept busy on the property developing the former hotel grounds growing an orchard raising fruits and vegetables his reptiles and squab as well as involved in some fashion with the bottling and selling of the spring water which came from underground sources
in mulford s time the collected spring water and squab would eventually find their way to tables as far away as harrisburg and philadelphia
additional information has been collected on the cold springs inhabitants of the early s including the fosters and can be found in the book cold spring hotel site
mulford also worked elsewhere for extra money
he worked as a camp naturalist and instructor for camp kenebec in maine where he would go in mid summer
in the winter he lectured to schools colleges and boy scout groups as well as the ymca
he was already renowned as both a naturalist and lecturer
the new jersey state board of agriculture had realized the value of his work and arranged to send him on a lecture tour around the state to discuss the value of snakes lizards and turtles at the farmer s institutes held at the various counties during the winter shortly after his marriage
he was known to many as the snake man having specialized in the reptiles and for that matter all forms of nature for many years
he was a charismatic speaker and always pleased his audiences with his enthusiasm and accentuation of humorous and interesting facts
newspaper articles stated that he had in his possession the largest private collection of living reptiles in the state
between the years of he enjoyed the great influence of elbert hubbard
hubbard a writer and publisher of east aurora n y
had established a philosophical society which coincided with the developing philosophy held by mulford
he was invited to lecture in new york on the top of snakes
the presentation earned him much favorable publicity because he had live snakes on stage with him
during the presentation they coiled around his neck found refuge in his pockets or slid inside his shirt against his warm body
his motive was to teach the audience understanding and acceptance toward snakes
he lectured in many eastern cities and mulford received publicity from elbert in several ways even having him write the chapter called just snakes in one of his books called so here then cometh pig pen pete or some chums of mine
while living in cold springs he maintained a friendship with another writer conrad richter
conrad and his wife lived in pine grove pennsylvania which was a nearby town
letters between the two as well as pictures in possession of the family reflect a close camaraderie
conrad once wrote if anyone has a unique paradise of his own on earth that one is mulford foster master of one of the prettiest and wildest valleys in pennsylvania he has on his immense primeval estate a limpid lake where wood creatures come down to drink a magic winding little river for his silent canoe a collection of almost every variety of domestic animal and bird pet skunks several dozen kinds of tamed snakes wild flowers trees and shrubs and a million wild creatures that have flocked to his place from the mountains about because they know that no harm can come to them here and foster attired in brown flannel and stealing noiselessly through the woods with the light foot and deftness of a mohican is all day long and often at evening out among them
in an opportunity presented itself that intrigued him with a training course offered by the davy tree expert company in kent ohio
since he already had an affinity with trees it was a simple step to learn how to sell tree service to the people who had large estates in the area of baltimore washington and virginia
he remained the davy company representative of these three states during the years
while working for the davy tree company he began entertaining the idea of changing professions and with his prior passion for growing and designing gardens in his youth he liked the prospect of becoming a landscape architect
he bought as many books on the subject and began teaching himself the art
in he moved his family to florida and began establishing himself as a well respected landscaper first in palm beach where he was in charge of landscape design with exotic gardens then moving to orlando florida
many orlando businesses and estates have mulford s artistic mark on them still present to this day
a few of the important landscape projects done between and include lancaster park a subdivision in orlando fl the ranch house grounds for horseshoe ranch a acre km ranch on the kissimmee river florida the episcopal cathedral church of st luke downtown orlando where he provided the original landscape design with his son bert revamping the historic church in poinsettia park in winter haven fl ivanhoe shores subdivision in orlando fl azalea park orlando fl the herlong estate in leesburg fl the orlando garden club orlando fl the floating islands at leesburg fl during which foster moved a six trunk date palm from magnolia to leesburg
he won a design award for this project in
photographs and news clippings of his accomplishments are among the records at ucf a large interior tropical garden at the american mutual liability insurance company wakefield massachusetts as well as designed and supervised planting of the grounds of the clarkstown country club nyack ny and marine studios at marineland florida where he supervised the planting and rock gardens as well as working directly with the building and architects as well as the engineer
records relating to this project including photographs of the actual landscaping in progress along with the completed project and original brochure can be found among the ucf collection
when discussing his artistic career at age he reminisced that he never intended to be an artist
his wife reported to the newspaper interviewer that it just welled up out of him
mulford recalled that his first paintings were done on frosted windowpanes in new jersey
then in his early twenties he started experimenting with photography
this led directly into his early formal painting
a graflex camera became his constant companion on field trips exploring for snakes the primary subject on his film of those early days
it was at this time that he inevitably he saw the wildflowers in fields and forests
he experienced the light and shadow of the open and sheltered places
he wasn t able to always capture what he saw and felt on film
he eventually found the answer in painting
once he lived in florida he began taking photos of large estates including their grounds their gardens their specimen plants the vistas as seen through their gates and sold them for extra income
the owners often voiced the thought that they wished they could be in color as these were the days before color film or digital cameras
to add color he used cotton twisted on a toothpick dipped in paint
in tinting he had to get acquainted with artist oils
he saw details of leaves and bark
he saw the natural arrangements of branches and trunks and this made him think about structure
soon he had made the step from shading photographs to actual painting
his first painting was a canvas of a garden scene with a wall and large vases
it was hung in a baltimore show
from that painting forward he made time to paint
it was realistic work always of plants
his early paintings in were categorized as photographic
from there he began painting his series labeled realistic paintings from to
an unknown artist friend looked at one of his early efforts and made the comment that he did not have to paint every leaf
the period of details however survived until when the paintings became more stylized under the tutelage of leopold stokowski
this experience came about when stokowski a long time friend of mrs
bovington then employing mulford as a landscape architect for her estate told her he was looking for someone to accompany the family to europe
knowing the two individuals she immediately recommended mulford who accepted eagerly
stokowski took him to switzerland france and italy where they spent most of the summer of in the alps
stokowski was eager to see europe through mulford s eyes
he viewed life in a different way than stokowski had experienced before
it was mulford s great pleasure to explain plant life from his philosophical point of view
stokowski was the disciplinarian for mulford
he required a painting every day from him
it was almost by the demand of stokowski that mulford created over forty impressions of his experience that summer the major portions being the french alps in and around haute savoir
these paintings were compiled in a book stokowski sees that was privately printed but not published and the book is currently held by michael spencer who is still deciding on its future although many drawings and paintings are held by family members from this era and his memories are recollected in memoir accounts
after his return from europe he continued to paint with his newfound skills and outlook
between the years he painted a group of paintings he called stylized
in his orange grove painting he used familiar motifs in a highly stylized rendition of orange groves found everywhere at the time in florida
the round form of the orange tree mimicked by the round oranges themselves broken up by the lines of palm fronds fences and crates
the lake is repeating the line of the arched trunk hanging over it
the grouping of leaves each is repeating cleverly the whole form of the lake
the ornamental form of euphorbias was a persistent stimulus which produced three important paintings
in one euphorbia expressed a freer flowing style with its long undulating branches waving as a bali dancer would leading to the creation of the dancers
in fact the bali mask in the painting suggests a comparison
the very young bali girls perform their ceremonial dances by undulating motion of the arms rather than of the feet or body
mulford tried to show that the plant does the same thing in ten years what the bali dancer can do in ten minutes
the motion of the plant is solidified and has the duration of many years while the dance of the little girl is observed in but a fleeting glimpse of each movement
it is a unity of life s expressions with each form finding its happiness in expressing its rhythm within the limits of its timing
another painting polynesian took as its pivot the five points of a talkative stapelia whose form symbolizes heaven and sun
the pattern of the plant was echoed in the polynesian tapa cloth which was the inspiration for the painting and is seen in the background
the angular padilanthus was used as well to compose symphony of harmonious form
the idea of the painting was to build a symphonic interpretation of these motifs from their original primitive representations reappearing again in living form
the few simple motifs are found repeated in each object with a natural simplicity which the artist has caught and tried to reproduce
between the years and mulford s paintings took on a combination of stylized and decorative style
the philosophical series was started between and
in self defense every living thing has its own protection
this begins with the flowering date palm and its maze of thousand spikes or thorns pointing in every direction guarding reproduction from conception to maturing of egg cells that we call seeds or fruit
after this painting was completed mulford made a frame to hold it but immediately the frame seemed to defeat the purpose of the expression to be illustrated
the palm was confined
this led to painting the fronds on the frame extending them up and out of the frame
he helped develop the nyack country club in new york between the years
he used elephants to move and plow the dirt
being the sensitive man that he was he observed that each elephant had his own personality and it was reflected in their eyes
his elephant painting reflects this insight
in mimicry the artist sympathetically depicts the parallel relationship between one of the lizard s mannerisms and that of the anthurium
the little tendrils and feet of the lowest white leaved vine compared to the little feet of the lizard
the appearance is very much the same
the leaves and flower in the painting represents the family aracae of which the calla lily is a member
they are among the earliest and simplest forms of plants
the lizard as well is a very early and simple form of the reptiles
the painting is filled with subtle repetitions with colors suggesting a deep primeval forest with its many hidden forms
he described the motivation behind the climbers
it had been motivated by a huge old gnarled vine growing outside his studio at tropical arts
the vine in his painting climbs up the tree trunk for light and air
a small tendril is the intelligence part of the vine
it is the guide for its motivation
likewise the small tender tongue of the snake is the sensitive ear and nose which guide the snake to quiet resting places
the parallel means of motivation of these two forms create the similar shape of their bodies and a similar type of intelligence
the vine and snake are both elemental and early forms of life assembled in harmonious composition in this painting
his series impressions of mexico was completed between and
by he was almost entirely painting on wood such a flat application of oil paint that even artists asked him if he painted in tempera
he had painted on canvas but with the painting of his plant subjects he felt closer to the earth if he worked on wood
one medium that he used and was very skilled was painting in oil on rice pith
this is very thin like tissue paper although not paper at all but rather the pith of the rice plant cut under water by the japanese
so deft was his use of oil on this transparent lighter than air substance that there were often accusations that it surely could not be done with oil
the japanese frequently used tempera on rice pith so everyone assumed he was using it as well
while mulford was exploring south america he initially would paint his renditions of the plants that he and racine had collected including the flowers and fruit found
in the beginning he used oils which meant carrying around the tubes of paint as well as having to let the pictures dry each night
in south america this had its disadvantages when the weather was wet or temperatures too cold to allow the oil paintings to dry
he subsequently went to colored pencils which eliminated the need for drying could be done quickly and simplified the supplies he needed to carry around
during the decades of the s and s while much of mulford s time was spent exploring collecting writing cultivating and designing yards he also managed to paint
his final painting series was called synthesis and was completed over the years
he continued to do sketches and smaller works but palm family orchid family and cactus family were his last serious paintings
it is this last series that prompted the name passionate plant lover
he ultimately held a showing at the art center of maitland in september exhibiting all his paintings including all the series from the photographic to the synthesis
the foster estate donated mulford s last series of paintings to the harry p
leu gardens where they are part of a permanent art exhibit
mulford had the reputation of being the first hybridizer of the great self heading philodendron after bringing it to the us in and as a hybridizer had extensive demands to maintain
in he received the herbert medal for his work and discoveries in amaryllis
in he received a citation from the american horticultural society congress for contributions to the knowledge of bromeliads
he has more than forty notable crosses of bromeliads and amaryllids
the principal bromeliads that were hybridized were confined to the billbergia and vrieseas subfamilies
one popular hybrid was the billbergia muriel waterman billbergia horrida var
tigrina which he crossed in and it first flowered in
he had significant influence in the world of bromeliad growers and popularized the use of the term pups for naming the offshoots of bromeliads
he ran the tropical arts nursery in orlando florida located at n
magnolia on the corner of magnolia and colonial drive along with the latch string tea room and his art studio between the years
the business of growing and cultivating his plants took hours of his time
in he and his wife racine purchased acres m of property north of town and named it bromel la and years later their house was built and they moved on to the land
he had two greenhouses built each x feet m
the property would be a showcase and sanctuary of plants that had been both collected as well as his hybrid bromeliads during the years that he and racine owned the land
it had been hoped that after his death the property would remain a safe haven for bromeliads but the monies for this purpose were never raised and it was sold to private sources
mulford began traveling to mexico in taking his first trip with tibor pataky an artist friend
this trip was written about in his book adventures in mexico
he returned with racine his second wife in and began making frequent trips to south america over the next twenty years
mulford had a great interest in finding both new and old species of plants that could be used as both indoor decorations and landscape material
in mulford made a cuban expedition and from this trip he introduced agave caribbea to florida
around this same time mulford met lyman smith who was working at harvard s gray herbarium being referred to him by sources in the smithsonian
lyman ultimately would be of help with the identification and classification of the bromeliads that mulford would be collecting
it is lyman smith who directed him to brazil as he had himself been there and collected specimens
mulford had initially expressed an interest in exploring dutch guiana mulford s and racine s book brazil orchid of the tropics a long out of print book but available through used sources was a well told story of their trip to brazil
the book was a success and its completion brought the artful teamwork that was to mark the relationship between racine and mulford
his keen vision liveliness and resourcefulness balanced with her devotion and help in caring for all of the plants and helping organize his materials keep fastidious notes of her own were replicated many times over the years with many projects
in mulford set off to brazil again for six months covering much better known areas than their previous trip
mulford was again able to find new species in places that were supposedly already previously explored and declared exhausted by prior collectors over the previous one hundred and fifty years
mulford recollected a number of lost species during his trips to brazil
he introduced the brilliant yellow flowering tree tabebuia umbellate to north america
this tree is now famous in orlando florida
in he made his second six month expedition to brazil and trinidad this time specializing on bromeliads orchids and philodendrons
from this trip he introduced many new bromeliads and the now famous self heading philodendrons
world war ii put a stop to further expeditions for some years
mulford turned his attention to cultivating and popularizing the bromeliads
he continued to work with lyman smith who continued to describe and identify the bromeliads that had been brought back from brazil in the preceding years
in mulford resumed his expeditions
from brazil he brought back the begonia acetosa and introduced it to us gardeners
he and racine also traveled to columbia
this trip followed the earlier trail of the famous douard andr to confirm and add to his discoveries years before
these were considered one of the most important bromeliad areas of latin america
in he made a plant expedition around south america collecting in dutch guiana brazil bolivia peru ecuador colombia costa rica cuba puerto rico and trinidad
several years later in he would leave on a venezuelan plant expedition
this was followed in to jamaica with his final plant collecting trip made to mexico in
during these trips mulford not only collected thousands of herbarium specimens for the gray herbarium of harvard university and the smithsonian institution of washington dc where all of the scientific data is now on file but he also collected thousands of seeds and live plants to enrich the variety for florida gardens
the following is a list of the various south american locations that mulford was known to have traveled for plants outside the u s frequently with his wife racine at his side
the process of collecting and preserving the specimens was rigorous and well documented in existing records
the following species of plants are taken from the foster s book brazil orchid of the tropics the gray s herbarium at harvard university and the smithsonian institution s department of botany
as the number of new species found and collected from south america by mulford is estimated to be between and perhaps over this list is currently incomplete
other names can be found in the institute of botany in brazil although few new species are in that location
in the united states the plants were identified predominantly by lyman smith after mulford and at times mulford and his wife racine had collected the specimens and returned with them to the us
sometimes it was discovered in retrospect that he had indeed discovered a new species
mulford was a prolific story teller in addition to his other talents
he lectured on garden and natural history subjects to colleges universities schools and garden clubs throughout the united states as well as in venezuela costa rica and canada
he wrote quite a bit as well
his earliest writings came in the form of letters which were abundant even at an early age
some were simple postcards acknowledgments of his thoughts and yet now providing glimpses into his inner self and a road map to his outward activities
his letters were often either quite humorous or poetic prose although he also wrote poetry which he would use occasionally to adorn christmas cards and the like
in the later years after his move to florida it was typical that you could find them scribbled on his tropical arts letterhead paper
beginning in the s mulford along with racine began publishing their ever expanding bromeliad knowledge in a wide variety of garden and horticultural publications
these ranged from well known venues such as the smithsonian the new york times and house beautiful to trade journals such as the national horticultural magazine and cactus and succulent journal to name just a few
a special article called puya the pineapple s andean ancestor was published in the october national geographic magazine along with color photos
it was also during this time that they began writing their collaborative books based on travels to south america including brazil orchid of the tropics bromeliads a cultural handbook and air gardens of brazil mulford also became the founder and president of the bromeliad society in through and became its editor from through and with his editorship of the bulletin his audience became worldwide
he wrote numerous pieces for the bromeliad journal international which can be found in their archives with an examples frequently seen in reprints even today
he maintained this responsibility for over a decade with racine acting a copy editor for years
both were heavily committed to this publication at the beginning often using their own monies to help publish the journal in the early years
the following publications by mulford b foster are discussed in this article
a more complete list of his publications may be found at
mulford was married twice
his first wife was fridel tautenhahn whom he married nov in philadelphia
it was felt by some that his intense relationship with her father led to this marriage
they had children gerda bert miriam and then twins with only one daughter jeanne eunice surviving in
they divorced in in florida although the children remained nearby with their mother
he married racine sarasy in becoming racine foster for whom the bromeliad genus racinaea was named after
there were no children from this marriage
he had numerous grandchildren and great grandchildren as well as a large extended family around him throughout the latter part of his life
in mulford experienced a devastating cerebrovascular accident leaving him paralyzed on one side and almost always using a wheelchair
despite the paralysis he continued to sketch with his good hand
he had a series of smaller strokes over the next four years before ultimately dying at his home in
following his death a memorial fund was established at the marie selby botanical gardens
the mulford b
foster identification center was established which remains to this day with the intent on furthering interest and study of the bromeliad
mulford s artwork can be found in public as well as personal collections around the world
two online links to his works are listed here
