peter ramsey and april lawrence as burgess pedestriansin william joyce and reel fx launched a joint venture aimesworth amusements to produce cg animated feature films one of which was set to be the guardians of childhood based on joyce s idea
the film was not realized but they did create a short animated film the man in the moon directed by joyce which introduced the guardians idea and served as an inspiration for the film
early in joyce sold the film rights to dreamworks animation after the studio assured him it would respect his vision for the characters and that he would be involved with the creative process
in november it was revealed that dreamworks had hired peter ramsey to make his feature debut as director of what was then titled the guardians and playwright david lindsay abaire to write the script lindsay abaire had previously worked with joyce by co writing the screenplay for robots
joyce acted as a co director for the first few years but left this position after the death of his daughter mary katherine who died of a brain tumor
joyce continued to work on the film only as an executive producer while ramsey took the helm solo as a full time director making him the first african american to direct a big budget cg animated film as well as making it one of the first dreamworks films to have only one director instead of two and not have a co director
as with some previous dreamworks films guillermo del toro came on board to join joyce as an executive producer
present almost from the beginning he was able to help shape the story character design theme and structure of the film
he said he was proud that the filmmakers were making parts of the film dark and moody and poetic and expressed hope this might set a different tone for family movies for entertainment movies the final title rise of the guardians was announced in early along with the first cast
roger deakins the cinematographer who had already worked on the previous dreamworks film how to train your dragon advised on the lighting to achieve its real look
he selected photographic references for color keys and during the production gave notes on contrast saturation depth of field and light intensity
the film contains a lot of special effects particularly the volumetric particles for depicting sandman and pitch
for this dreamworks animation developed openvdb a more efficient tool and format for manipulating and storing volume data like smoke and other amorphous materials
openvdb had been already used on puss in boots and madagascar europe s most wanted and was released in august for free as an open source project with a hope to become an industry standard
although the film is based on the joyce s book series it contains differences from the books
the book series begun in explains the origins of the characters while the film takes place about years after the books and shows how the characters function in present time
joyce explained because i don t want people to read the book and then go see the movie and go oh i like the book better and i also didn t want them to know what happens in the movie
and i also knew that during the progress of film production a lot of things can change
so i wanted to have a sort of distance so we were able to invoke the books and use them to help us figure out the world of the movie but i didn t want them to be openly competitive to each other the idea for the guardians came from joyce s daughter who asked him if he thought santa claus had ever met the easter bunny the film includes a dedication to her as well a song still dream sung over the end credits
originally the film was set to be released on november but dreamworks animation pushed the film to november to avoid competition with pixar s upcoming film monsters university which in turn had been pushed to november to avoid competition with the twilight saga breaking dawn part
monsters university was then pushed to june with disney s wreck it ralph taking its place
french composer alexandre desplat composed the original music for the film which was released on november by var se sarabande
the score was recorded in london at abbey road studios and air studios and performed by the london symphony orchestra with a choral contribution by london voices
david lindsay abaire wrote the lyrics for the end credit song still dream which was performed by soprano ren e fleming
stravinsky s firebird suite can also be heard during the scene where north first appears

the website s critical consensus reads a sort of avengers for the elementary school set rise of the guardians is wonderfully animated and briskly paced but it s only so so in the storytelling department metacritic which assigns a rating out of top reviews from mainstream critics calculated a score of based on reviews which indicates mixed or average reviews
audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of a on an a to f scale
carrie rickey of the philadelphia inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four and found that the film s characters have a primal familiarity as though they were developed by a tag team of maurice sendak and walt disney olly richards of empire wrote it s gorgeously designed deftly written and frequently laugh out loud funny
for child or adult this is a fantasy to get lost in the washington post s michael o sullivan also gave the film a positive review and said thoughts become things
that s the message of rise of the guardians a charming if slightly dark and cobwebbed animated feature about how believing in something makes it real or real enough roger ebert of the chicago sun times gave the film three stars out of four and wrote in his review there s an audience for this film
it s not me
i gather younger children will like the breakneck action the magical ability to fly and the young hero who has tired of only being a name though he did say their parents and older siblings may find the minute running time quite long enough
todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter called the film a lively but derivative d storybook spree for some unlikely action heroes conversely justin chang in variety said even tots may emerge feeling slightly browbeaten by this colorful strenuous and hyperactive fantasy which has moments of charm and beauty but often resembles an exploding toy factory rather than a work of honest enchantment joe morgenstern of the wall street journal found that the film lacks a resonant center and that the script seems to have been written by committee with members lobbying for each major character and the action set in vast environments all over the map spreads itself so thin that a surfeit of motion vitiates emotion
rise of the guardians grossed million in the united states and canada and million in other countries for a worldwide total of million
in north america the film opened to million over its extended five day weekend and with million over the three day weekend it reached fourth place behind the twilight saga breaking dawn part skyfall and lincoln
the film s opening was the lowest debut for a dreamworks animation film since flushed away
while the film did gross more than double of its million budget it still did not turn a profit for dreamworks animation due to its high production and marketing costs forcing the studio to take an million write down
this marked the first time that the studio had lost money on an animated film since sinbad legend of the seven seas
as a result of this combined with other factors in february the studio announced it was laying off employees as part of a company wide restructuring
additionally the studio was heavily dependent on the success of rise of the guardians to fund other studio projects most notably the ill fated me and my shadow project
but due to the failure to gain a stable box office response it heavily affected the studio s ability to release original movies
the rome film festival and vanity fair magazine awarded the new vanity fair international award for cinematic excellence in november to rise of the guardians
the film also received the hollywood animation award at the th annual hollywood film festival held on october
