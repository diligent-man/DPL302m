laestadianism also known as laestadian lutheranism and apostolic lutheranism is a pietistic lutheran revival movement started in s pmi in the middle of the th century
named after swedish lutheran state church administrator and temperance movement leader lars levi laestadius it is the biggest pietistic revivalist movement in the nordic countries
it has members mainly in finland northern america norway russia and sweden
there are also smaller congregations in africa south america and central europe
in addition laestadians have missionaries in countries
the number of laestadians worldwide is estimated to be between and
most laestadians in finland are part of the national lutheran church of finland cf
communion of nordic lutheran dioceses but in america where there is no official lutheran church they founded their own denomination which split into several sub groups in the mid th century
because of doctrinal opinion differences and personality conflicts the movement split into branches of which about are active today
the three large main branches are conservative laestadianism corresponds to the laestadian lutheran church in north america known to other laestadians as the heidemans after th century leader paul a
heideman the firstborn in north america old apostolic lutheran church esikoinens to other laestadian denominations and rauhan sana word of peace known in usa and canada as the apostolic lutheran church of america to other laestadians the mickelsens after th century leader reverend andrew mickelsen
these comprise about percent of laestadians
other branches are small and some of them inactive
in finland the el m n sana the word of life group as the most mainline of the different branches of laestadianism has been prominent within the hierarchy of the evangelical lutheran church of finland two members have been elected bishops of oulu and one has served as chaplain general head chaplain of the finnish defence forces the equivalent of a major general
all branches share many essential teachings including a central emphasis on the lutheran doctrine of justification forgiveness and grace
another core teaching concerns essential differences in lifestyle and beliefs between true believers on one hand and false christians sometimes distinguished as living faith versus dead faith and unbelievers on the other
the leaders of the two largest laestadian sub groups the conservative laestadians and firstborn laestadians have for decades excluded each other and all other laestadian sub groups from the kingdom of heaven even though the denominations core doctrines are nearly indistinguishable
the leadership of the smaller third main sub group the federation has continued to regard the other sub groups as of living faith after having unsuccessfully sought to preserve unity within laestadianism when its larger counterparts leaders in the s called for and later required dissociation from the federation and other laestadian denominations
the church teaches that every believer has the authority to testify that others sins are forgiven sometimes referred to as the audible declaration of the forgiveness of sins
laestadians usually proclaim the forgiveness of sins in jesus name and blood
laestadianism holds that when a christian has committed a sin whether in thought or deed she or he should confess the sin to another believer
thus it is a common practice among laestadians in or out of church at any time but especially during the church service prior to the rite of holy communion to be confessing their sins to one another or occasionally to one of the church ministers performing the sacrament
a common declaration is believe your sin s forgiven in jesus name and shed blood this procedure ingrained in laestadianism differs from absolution in mainstream lutheran churches in several aspects including that the request for forgiveness need not be and most often is not to the minister the confession is often made openly confession is not by appointment but rather readily available to any believer from any other believer at any time and the specific wording of the declaration states that the means of atonement is christ s shed blood
because a laestadian takes very seriously the proposition that grace exists only for one whose sins have been specifically forgiven there is scarcely another rite in this movement that would rival the importance of the declaration of forgiveness
this doctrine is a unique extension of the priesthood of the believer doctrine
when greeting each other laestadians say god s peace in english or in finnish jumalan terve meaning god s greeting or welcome
to take their leave of each other they say god s peace in english or in finnish jumalan rauhaa
worldliness is discouraged and laestadians frown on pre marital sex and on alcohol consumption except in the sacrament of holy communion
conservative laestadians frown upon worldly vices such as dancing television birth control rhythmic music make up earrings movies tattoos and cursing
some conservative elements within the church go even further in rejecting the ways of the world for examples refusing to buy insurance prohibiting their children s participation in organized school sports and removing their car radios
especially large numbers of firstborn apostolic lutherans and many members of the most conservative congregations within the word of peace group for examples do not use birth control because they believe that a child is a gift from god therefore many laestadian families are large
the central activities of laestadians are annual or more frequent church conventions including the summer services of conservative laestadians attended by members from congregations far and wide and for the youth haps gatherings of teenagers and young adults to sing from songs and hymns of zion and visit song services bonfires youth discussions caretaking meetings and revival meetings
within firstborn laestadianism in scandinavia the most important yearly events are the christmas services in g llivare and the midsummer services in lahti where thousands of firstborn laestadians gather each year from different countries
different branches publish their newspapers and magazines
in finland the bible version primarily used by laestadians is the finnish bible of which unlike newer translations is based on the textus receptus
the central association of the finnish associations of peace srk publishes a triple finnish translation and that is used as both a study and a service bible by conservative laestadian preachers
american and canadian laestadianism uses the king james version based as well on the textus receptus
the name of the movement stems from lars levi laestadius a swedish s mi preacher and administrator for the swedish state lutheran church in s pmi who was also a noted botanist
laestadius started the movement when working as a pastor for the church of sweden in northern sweden in the s
laestadius met a sami woman named milla clementsdotter from f llinge in the municipality of krokom in j mtland during an inspection tour of sele
she belonged to a revival movement within the church of sweden led by pastor pehr brandell of the parish of nora in the municipality of kramfors in ngermanland and characterized by pietistic and moravian influences
she told laestadius about her spiritual experiences on her journey to a truly living christianity and after the meeting laestadius felt he had come to understand the secret of living faith
he had had a deep experience of having entered a state of grace of having received god s forgiveness for his sins and of at last truly seeing the path that leads to eternal life
his sermons acquired in his own words a new kind of colour to which people began to respond
the movement began to spread from sweden to finland and norway particularly among the s mi and the kvens
he preferred his followers to be known simply as christians but others started to call them laestadians
two great challenges laestadius had faced since his early days as a church minister were the indifference of his s mi parishioners who had been forced by the swedish government to convert from their shamanistic religion to lutheranism and the misery caused them by alcoholism
the spiritual understanding laestadius acquired and shared in his new sermons filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the sami that they could understand
about a god who cared about the lives of the people had a profound positive effect on both problems
an account from the s mi cultural perspective recalls a new desire among the s mi to learn to read and a bustle and energy in the church with people confessing their sins crying and praying for forgiveness within laestadianism this was known as liikutukset a kind of ecstasy
drunkenness and cattle theft diminished which had a positive influence on the samis relationships finances and family life
the rapid rise of laestadianism among the s mi was due to several factors
laestadius proudly self identified as s mi through his southern s mi mother
he spoke and preached in two s mi dialects
further he chose uneducated lay preachers from the s mi reindeer herders to travel year around with them and preach to the unrepented among them
additionally in the early days of the movement laestadius in order to find common ground with his parishioners borrowed the s mis own familiar pagan deities and concepts and adapted them to christianity
another factor in the rise of laestadianism among the s mi was that the state mandated boarding schools soon came to be populated by laestadian personnel
next the strict moral code including strict temperance of laestadianism appealed to the s mi
whole communities that had been wrecked by alcoholism went sober virtually overnight
this had the added positive effect of improving the s mis social standing with the outside world
finally laestadianism was a faith that the s mi could identify as originating from within inasmuch as laestadius himself professed to have come to know the true living faith only upon his encounter with the poor abused s mi woman milla clementsdotter
a faction within laestadianism has believed that the movement is a contemporary descendant of an unbroken line of living christianity via the luther the bohemian brethren the lollards and the waldensians all the way back to the primitive church
martin luther jan hus john wycliffe and peter waldo are seen as spiritual ancestors of laestadianism

even within the laestadian tfr of there is diversity with a moderate group preferring to stop at four children and practise birth control while a conservative cluster engages in unrestrained reproduction
no research has been done on laestadians level of endogamy and membership retention as of
however they are residentially and occupationally integrated so lose more members to assimilation for example in the small town of larsmo despite some losses to outmarriage and emigration their share doubled over just thirty years to about in and was predicted to be a two thirds majority of the town in a generation
