the crimean offensive april may known in german sources as the battle of the crimea was a series of offensives by the red army directed at the german held crimea
the red army s th ukrainian front engaged the german th army of army group a which consisted of wehrmacht and romanian formations
the battles ended with the evacuation of the crimea by the germans
german and romanian forces suffered considerable losses during the evacuation
the germans took control of the crimean peninsula after the crimean campaign in
during late and early the wehrmacht was pressed back along its entire front line in the east
in october the th army withdrew from the kuban bridgehead across the kerch strait into the crimea
during the following months the red army pushed back the wehrmacht in southern ukraine eventually cutting off the land based connection of th army through the perekop isthmus in november
the wehrmacht was able to successfully hold on to the crimea even after it had been cut off by land due to their ability to supply it via the black sea
holding the crimea was considered important as its loss would negatively affect the attitude of turkey and put romanian oilfields under risk of soviet air attacks
aside from soviet landings across the kerch strait and in the north eastern sector near sivash at the end of the soviet army largely ignored the crimea for the next five months
paul ludwig ewald von kleist was removed from the command of army group a on march
he was succeeded by ferdinand sch rner
an assault across the perekop isthmus was launched on april by elements of the th ukrainian front s nd guards and st armies
the th army defended but was unable to stop the advance
kerch was reached by the separate coastal army on april simferopol about mi km northeast of sevastopol followed two days later
the th army was retreating toward sevastopol by april with remaining axis forces in the crimea concentrating around the city by the end of the third week of april
the okh intended to hold sevastopol as a fortress as the red army had done during the first crimean campaign in
however the fortifications of the city had never been restored and sevastopol was not the strong defensive position that it had been in
fighting broke out in the city outskirts towards the end of april and the city fell on may less than a month after the start of the offensive
the axis sea evacuation to constan a was attacked by soviet land based bombers
the evacuation of the crimea in april may was the most complex and extensive operation of the romanian navy during the second world war
from april to may numerous german and romanian warships escorted many convoys between constan a and sevastopol
the scale and importance of the operation can be attested by the usage in combat of all four romanian destroyers the largest axis warships in the black sea
the last phase of the evacuation may saw the fiercest combat as axis ships transported under constant attacks from soviet aircraft and shore artillery over troops
of these were transported by romanian ships
on may the german tanker friederike was torpedoed and heavily damaged by soviet submarine l preventing her participation
in total romanian and german convoys evacuated over axis troops from the crimea most of them over during the first phase of the evacuation april
no romanian navy warships were lost during the evacuation however the destroyer regele ferdinand came close to being sunk
she was struck by a large aerial bomb which fell in her fuel tanks but failed to detonate
the bomb was extracted several days after the end of the operation
two naval actions involving the romanian navy took place during the second phase of the evacuation april may near sevastopol
on april the soviet leninets class submarine l was twice attacked with depth charges and damaged by the romanian gunboat ghiculescu numerous bubbles emerged from the depths after each attack before being finished off by the german submarine hunter uj
during the night of april a convoy escorted by the romanian gunboat ghiculescu the german submarine hunter uj one r boat two kfk naval trawlers and mfps including the romanian pta and pta engaged the soviet g class motor torpedo boats tka tka and tka after the three attacked and damaged the german submarine hunter uj
ghiculescu opened fire with tracer rounds enabling the entire escort group to locate the two soviet mtbs and open fire
tka was hit and sunk
over soviet aircraft were also shot down during the evacuation including two by the minelaying destroyer escort amiral murgescu
the last axis pockets in the crimea were destroyed on may
the last axis warship to leave the peninsula was amiral murgescu carrying on board axis troops including the german general walter hartmann
in a meeting with adolf hitler in berchtesgaden jaenecke had insisted that sevastopol should be evacuated and his cut off army of men withdrawn
after the loss of the crimea he was held responsible arrested in romania and court martialed
only the intervention of heinz guderian saved his life
he was dismissed from the army on january
the german and romanian formations suffered the loss of men many of whom drowned during the evacuation
the sinking of the totila and teja on may alone caused up to deaths
in total the german losses at sea amounted to five cargo ships one tanker three tugs three lighters three motorboats and four submarine hunters while the romanians lost three cargo ships
the partially successful evacuation of axis troops from the crimea earned the commander of the romanian navy rear admiral horia macellariu the knight s cross of the iron cross
