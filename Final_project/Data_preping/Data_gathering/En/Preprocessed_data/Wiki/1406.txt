Psychro Cave Greek Σπήλαιο Ψυχρού is an ancient Minoan sacred cave in Lasithi plateau in the Lasithi district of eastern Crete
Psychro is associated with the Diktaean Cave Greek Δικταῖον Ἄντρον Diktaion Antron one of the putative sites of the birth of Zeus
Other legends place Zeus' birthplace as the Idaean Cave on Mount Ida
According to Hesiod Theogony - Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Lyctus and hid him in a cave of Mount Aegaeon
Since the late nineteenth century the cave above the modern village of Psychro has been identified with the Diktaean Cave although there are other candidates especially a cave above Palaikastro on Mount Petsofas
The village of Psychro °′″N °′″E﻿ ﻿°N °E﻿ ﻿ Psychro village is metres above sea level
The cave is located in the prefecture of Lasithi
The Dictaean Cave is famous in Greek mythology as the place where Amalthea nurtured the infant Zeus with her goat's milk
The archaeology attests to the site's long use as a place of cult worship
The nurse of Zeus who was charged by Rhea to raise the infant Zeus in secret here to protect him from his father Cronus Krnos is also called the nymph Adrasteia in some contexts
It is one of a number of caves believed to have been the birthplace or hiding place of Zeus
The mountains of which the cave are part are known in Crete as Dikte
The cave was first excavated in by Joseph Hatzidakis President of the Syllogos at Candia and F
In Sir Arthur Evans investigated the site
Demargne and David George Hogarth of the British School at Athens conducted further investigations Hogarth's brief report published in gives a picture of the destruction wrought by primitive archaeological methods immense fallen blocks from the upper cave roof were blasted before removal the rich black earth had been previously ransacked
The stuccoed altar in the upper cave was discovered in surrounded by strata of ashes pottery and other refuse among which were votive objects in bronze terracotta iron and bone with fragments of some thirty libation tables and countless conical ceramic cups for food offerings
Bones among the ash layer attest to sacrifice of bulls sheep and goats deer and a boar
The undisturbed lowest strata of the upper cave represented the transition between Late Minoan Kamares ware to earliest Mycenaean levels finds represented the Geometric Style of the ninth century BCE but few later than that
More recent excavation has revealed the use of the cave reached back to Early Minoan times and votive objects attest to the cave's being the most frequented shrine by Middle Minoan times MM IIIA
The lower grotto falls steeply with traces of a rock-cut stair to a pool out of which stalactites rise
Much earth had been thrown down by diggers of the Upper Grotto Hogarth reported and this was found full of small bronze objects In the vertical chinks of the lowest stalactites Hogarth's team found toy double-axes knife-blades needles and other objects in bronze placed there by dedicators as in niches
The mud at the edge of the subterranean pool was also rich in similar things and in statuettes of two types male and female and engraved gems
In the art historian and archaeologist John Boardman published the finds uncovered by these and other excavations
While clay human figurines are normally found in peak sanctuaries Psychro and the sanctuary on Mount Ida stand out as the only sacred caves that have yielded human figurines
Psychro is also a unique sacred cave for a bronze leg also known as a votive body part which is the only votive body part to be found in a sacred cave
More common sacred cave finds at Psychro include stone and ceramic lamps
Psychro yielded an uncommon number of semi-precious stones including carnelian steatite amethyst jasper and hematite
Psychro's artefacts are now on display at the Heraklion Museum the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford the Louvre and the British Museum
The Idaean Cave Greek Ιδαίο άντρο is a system of caves located on the slopes of Mount Ida on Crete °′″N °′″E﻿ ﻿°N °E﻿ ﻿ Idaean Cave
The deep cave has a single entrance and features stalagmites and stalactites
In antiquity it was a place of worship because it was believed to be the cave where the titan Rhea hid the infant Zeus to protect him from his father Cronus who intended to swallow him like others of his progeny
It is one of a number of caves believed to have been the birthplace or hiding place of Zeus
According to a variant of this legend the Kouretes a band of mythical warriors undertook to dance their wild noisy war dances in front of the cave so that the clamour would keep Cronus from hearing the infant's crying
Excavations have revealed a large number of votive cult offerings on the site
