the douglas c cargomaster is an american large turboprop cargo aircraft built between and by the douglas aircraft company for use with the united states air force
the c was the usaf s only production turboprop powered strategic airlifter entering service shortly after the lockheed c hercules which is designated a tactical airlifter
it provided airlift services in a wide range of applications being replaced by the c galaxy in the early s
the c was designed to meet the requirements for the usaf s logistic carrier support system ss l for a new strategic transport
the aircraft differed considerably from the c globemaster and c globemaster iis that had preceded it
a high mounted wing external blister fairings on each side for the landing gear and rear loading and side loading doors ensured that access to and the volume of the large cargo compartment were not compromised by these structures
the cargo compartment ft m in length and ft m high was pressurized heated and ventilated
the cargomasters went directly into production as c a no prototypes were built
the first cargomaster flew on april
the first c as were delivered to the military air transport service mats in august and began flying mats air routes throughout the world
two c s established transatlantic speed records for transport aircraft on their first flights to europe
the fleet of aircraft proved itself invaluable during the vietnam war
the cargomaster soldiered on until the lockheed c galaxy entered service in the early s
the c was then retired and most airplanes were cut up within months of being delivered to davis monthan air force base tucson arizona after their final flights in
fifty aircraft c a and c b were constructed and put into service with the usaf
a single c a and a c b were built and kept at douglas long beach as test articles
they had no construction numbers or usaf tail numbers
the c had large tail doors and side doors and a large open cargo area
the c a carried many large and heavy loads including atlas and titan icbms although it was not designed specifically to transport icbms
it may indeed have been the reverse
the c design was frozen by in order to build the airplanes that first flew in april
the designs of both the atlas and titan were not firm until after when their contracts were signed
with the c b the rear cargo doors were modified to open to the side petal doors making icbm loading much easier
air transporting the ballistic missiles such as the atlas titan and minuteman was much less expensive safer and faster than road transport
several hundred minuteman and other icbms were airlifted to and from their operational bases by c s
the c also transported atlas saturn and titan rockets to cape canaveral for use as launch boosters in the gemini mercury and apollo space programs
after the apollo capsules splashed down they were airlifted in c s from naval station norfolk virginia or hickam afb hawaii to ellington afb texas or to california
the c was for many years the only usaf aircraft capable of hauling very large or very heavy cargo
despite the douglas c globemaster ii s capabilities there was much cargo that it could not carry because of its configuration with a cargo deck ft m off the ground and its lower though substantial engine power
the c continued in service after the formation of the usafs military airlift command on january
by shortly before the introduction of the lockheed c galaxy the cargomaster was obsolete as well as being worn out and all were withdrawn from service
the c had a hour airframe that was life extended to hours
severe vibration caused critical stress corrosion of the airframes to the point that the aircraft were beyond economical operation
the air force managed to keep as many of the c fleet in service as possible until the c entered squadron service
c s set a number of unofficial records including records for military transport aircraft on trans atlantic and trans pacific routes
among the longest were non stop flights from tachikawa airfield japan to travis air force base california hours on may mi km mph km h and hickam air force base hawaii to dover air force base delaware in about hours mi km mph km h
the only fai officially sanctioned record was in december when c a lifted a payload of lb kg to an altitude of ft m at dover air force base delaware

th air transport squadron military airlift squadron early in its life cycle the airplane developed a reputation of crashing
crew members referred to it as a widowmaker
some would not fly in the c since the cause of the crashes was unknown
several issues were discovered after crash investigations
the first issue was with the auto pitch controller on the propellers
a time delay was added to relieve stress on the nose casing
the second issue was that the stall characteristics gave little warning to the crew
the left wing was found to stall before the right wing
the fix was simple a small strip of metal was attached to the right wing causing it to stall simultaneously with the left wing
as the aircraft neared the end of its hour life cycle the last c b crash occurred on february
it was determined the airframe split at the cargo door
the final fix was a band around the airframe to strengthen the end of the c was near
the c a galaxy debuted in and marked the end of the c
of aircraft built nine were lost in crashes and one was destroyed in a ground fire
