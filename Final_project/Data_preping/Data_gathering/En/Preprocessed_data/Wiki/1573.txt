The Douglas C- Cargomaster is an American large turboprop cargo aircraft built between and by the Douglas Aircraft Company for use with the United States Air Force
The C- was the USAF's only production turboprop-powered strategic airlifter entering service shortly after the Lockheed C- Hercules which is designated a tactical airlifter
It provided airlift services in a wide range of applications being replaced by the C- Galaxy in the early s
The C- was designed to meet the requirements for the USAF's Logistic Carrier Support System SSL for a new strategic transport
The aircraft differed considerably from the C- Globemaster and C- Globemaster IIs that had preceded it
A high-mounted wing external blister fairings on each side for the landing gear and rear-loading and side-loading doors ensured that access to and the volume of the large cargo compartment were not compromised by these structures
The cargo compartment ft m in length and ft m high was pressurized heated and ventilated
The Cargomasters went directly into production as C-A no prototypes were built
The first C-As were delivered to the Military Air Transport Service MATS in August and began flying MATS air routes throughout the world
Two C-s established transatlantic speed records for transport aircraft on their first flights to Europe
The fleet of aircraft proved itself invaluable during the Vietnam War
The Cargomaster soldiered on until the Lockheed C- Galaxy entered service in the early s
The C- was then retired and most airplanes were cut up within months of being delivered to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base Tucson Arizona after their final flights in
Fifty aircraft C-A and C-B were constructed and put into service with the USAF
A single C-A and a C-B were built and kept at Douglas Long Beach as test articles
They had no construction numbers or USAF tail numbers
The C- had large tail doors and side doors and a large open cargo area
The C-A carried many large and heavy loads including Atlas and Titan ICBMs although it was not designed specifically to transport ICBMs
It may indeed have been the reverse
The C- design was frozen by in order to build the airplanes that first flew in April
The designs of both the Atlas and Titan were not firm until after when their contracts were signed
With the C-B the rear cargo doors were modified to open to the side petal doors making ICBM loading much easier
Air transporting the ballistic missiles such as the Atlas Titan and Minuteman was much less expensive safer and faster than road transport
Several hundred Minuteman and other ICBMs were airlifted to and from their operational bases by C-s
The C- also transported Atlas Saturn and Titan rockets to Cape Canaveral for use as launch boosters in the Gemini Mercury and Apollo space programs
After the Apollo capsules splashed down they were airlifted in C-s from Naval Station Norfolk Virginia or Hickam AFB Hawaii to Ellington AFB Texas or to California
The C- was for many years the only USAF aircraft capable of hauling very large or very heavy cargo
Despite the Douglas C- Globemaster II's capabilities there was much cargo that it could not carry because of its configuration with a cargo deck ft m off the ground and its lower though substantial engine power
The C- continued in service after the formation of the USAFs Military Airlift Command on January
By shortly before the introduction of the Lockheed C- Galaxy the Cargomaster was obsolete as well as being worn out and all were withdrawn from service
The C- had a -hour airframe that was life-extended to hours
Severe vibration caused critical stress corrosion of the airframes to the point that the aircraft were beyond economical operation
The Air Force managed to keep as many of the C- fleet in service as possible until the C- entered squadron service
C-s set a number of unofficial records including records for military transport aircraft on trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific routes
Among the longest were non-stop flights from Tachikawa Airfield Japan to Travis Air Force Base California hours on May mi km mph kmh and Hickam Air Force Base Hawaii to Dover Air Force Base Delaware in about hours mi km mph kmh
The only FAI officially sanctioned record was in December when C-A lifted a payload of lb kg to an altitude of ft m at Dover Air Force Base Delaware

th Air Transport SquadronMilitary Airlift Squadron Early in its life-cycle the airplane developed a reputation of crashing
Crew members referred to it as a widowmaker
Some would not fly in the C- since the cause of the crashes was unknown
Several issues were discovered after crash investigations
The first issue was with the auto-pitch controller on the propellers
A time delay was added to relieve stress on the nose casing
The second issue was that the stall characteristics gave little warning to the crew
The left wing was found to stall before the right wing
The fix was simple a small strip of metal was attached to the right wing causing it to stall simultaneously with the left wing
As the aircraft neared the end of its -hour life-cycle the last C-B crash occurred on February
It was determined the airframe split at the cargo door
The final fix was a band around the airframe to strengthen the end of the C- was near
The C-A Galaxy debuted in and marked the end of the C-
Of aircraft built nine were lost in crashes and one was destroyed in a ground fire

- ATW — Destroyed November in crash on takeoff at CFB Goose Bay Labrador
Probable cause was a power stall on takeoff due to icing or possibly aerodynamic instability of the aircraft January
- ATW — Destroyed January crashed into water after takeoff from Wake Island April
- ATW — Destroyed April ditched off the east coast of Okinawa Japan after propeller pitch became fixed due to electrical problems in either propeller control or propeller power circuits February

Preserved at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton Ohio
On December this aircraft established a world record for propeller-driven aircraft by carrying a payload of lb kg to an altitude of ft m
It was flown to the Museum on March
In the collection of the Pima Air Space Museum adjacent to DavisMonthan Air Force Base in Tucson Arizona
Located at the Air Mobility Command Museum at Dover Air Force Base Delaware
This aircraft had been at the Strategic Air Command Museum at Offutt Air Force Base Nebraska for many years and was donated to the AMC Museum when the SAS Museum moved from its on base location in the late s to its new location near Ashland Nebraska
However a tornado swept through the museum in badly damaging many aircraft in the outdoor display collection and destroying the C-
NAB previously owned by Cargomaster Corporation was never certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration for civilian operation and could only be flown as a government aircraft mostly for the State of Alaska
NAB was based at ANC and was flown as a transport until carrying cargo such as pipeline sections
It also flew frontend loader trash trucks and heavy equipment to the Alaskan bush ie Point Hope Point Lay Wainright Barrow Deadhorse Barter Island and Anatovich Pass in April
In August it flew its last flight to the Jimmy Doolittle Air Space Museum at Travis Air Force Base Fairfield California where it has been restored to USAF markings and maintained on static displayNot on displayTwo C-As have been in storage at Mojave Air and Space Port California since the s
