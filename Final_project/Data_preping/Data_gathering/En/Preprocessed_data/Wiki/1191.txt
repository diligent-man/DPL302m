in the game of rugby union there are players on each team comprising eight forwards wearing jerseys numbered and seven backs numbered
in addition there may be up to eight replacement players on the bench numbered
players are not restricted to a single position although they generally specialise in just one or two that suit their skills and body types
players that play multiple positions are called utility players
forwards compete for the ball in scrums and line outs and are generally bigger and stronger than the backs
props push in the scrums while the hooker tries to secure the ball for their team by hooking it back with their heel
the hooker is also the one who is responsible for throwing the ball in at line outs where it is mostly competed for by the locks who are generally the tallest players on the team
the flankers and number eight are expected to be the first players to arrive at a breakdown and play an important role in securing possession of the ball for their team
the backs play behind the forwards and are usually more lightly built and faster
successful backs are skilful at passing and kicking
full backs need to be good defenders and kickers and have the ability to catch a kicked ball
the wingers are usually among the fastest players in a team and score many of the tries
the centres key attacking roles are to break through the defensive line and link successfully with wingers
the fly half can be a good kicker and generally directs the back line
the scrum half retrieves the ball from the forwards and needs a quick and accurate pass to get the ball to the backs often firstly to the fly half
early names such as three quarters for the wings and centres and outside half for fly half are sometimes used in the northern hemisphere while in new zealand the fly half and inside centre are called first five eighth and second five eighth respectively while the scrum half is known as the half back
the scrum a contest used to restart play must consist of eight players from each team the front row two props a loosehead and tighthead and a hooker the second row two locks and a back row two flankers and a number
the players outside the scrum are called the backs scrum half fly half inside centre outside centre two wings and a fullback
there is a maximum of players from each team allowed on a rugby field at any one time
the players positions at the start of the game are indicated by the numbers on the backs of their shirts to
the positions are divided into two main categories forwards numbered to and backs numbered to
in international matches there are eight substitutes that can replace an on field team mate
the substitutes numbered to can either take up the position of the player they replace or the on field players can be shuffled to make room for this player in another position
typically the forwards among the substitutes will have lower numbers than the backs
there are no personal squad numbers and a versatile player s position and number may change from one game to the next
players can also change positions during the match common examples are the fly half playing the full back s position in defence or a prop taking the hooker s position at line outs
different positions on the field suit certain skill sets and body types generally leading to players specialising in a limited number of positions
each position has certain roles to play on the field although most have been established through convention rather than law
during general play as long as they are not offside the players may be positioned anywhere on the field
it is during the set pieces scrum and line out that the positions are enforced
during early rugby union games there were only really two positions most players were in the forwards who formed part of the scrimmage which later was called scrummage and then scrum and a few defensive tends from goaltenders
eventually the attacking possibilities of playing close behind the scrimmage were recognised
the players who stationed themselves between the forwards and tends became known as half tends
later it was observed that the players outside scrimmage were not limited to a defensive role so the tends and half tends were renamed backs and half backs
as the game became more sophisticated the backs positioned at different depths behind the forwards
they were further differentiated into half backs three quarter backs and full back
specialised roles for the scrum also evolved with wing forward modern day flankers being employed to protect the half back
the first international between england and scotland was played in and consisted of players on each side thirteen forwards three half backs one three quarter and three full backs
the player numbers were reduced to fifteen in
numbers were added to the backs of players jerseys in the s initially as a way for coaches and selectors to rate individual players
the various positions have changed names over time and many are known by different names in different countries
players in the flanker positions were originally known as wing forwards while in the backs centre three quarter and wing three quarter were used to describe the outside centre and wing respectively although the terms are still sometimes used in the northern hemisphere the names used by world rugby tend to reflect northern hemisphere usage although fly half is still often known as outside half or stand off in britain and outhalf in ireland
in new zealand the scrum half is still referred to as the half back the fly half is referred to as the first five eighth the inside centre is called the second five eighth and the outside centre is simply known as centre
in america and canada the number is known as man
collective terms are also used to describe similar positions with the props and hookers combining to form the front row the locks the second row and the flankers and number the back row loose forwards or the loosies
the front row and second row combined are collectively termed the tight five
in the backs half backs can be used to describe the scrum half and fly half inside backs to describe the scrum half fly half and inside centre midfield for the fly half and both centres in new zealand it refers only to the second five eighth and centre and outside backs for the outside centre wings and full back
the two props are distinguished by being either a tighthead their head is positioned between the opposition prop and hooker or loosehead their head is positioned on the outside of the scrum
the blindside flanker binds to the scrum on the side closest to the side line while the openside flanker binds on the side with the most space between the scrum and the sideline
full backs usually position themselves several metres behind the back line
they field any deep opposition kicks and are often the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line
on attack they can enter the back line usually near the centres or wings with the aim of providing an extra person and overlapping the defending players
three of the most important attributes of a good full back are good catching ability under a high kick the ability to punt the ball a long distance with accuracy and the speed and skill to join in back line attacking moves especially counter attacks
the full back is the player most likely to field the high ball or up and unders kicked by the opposition
good hands are needed to ensure the ball is caught cleanly to deny the opposition the chance to regain possession
as the full back will inevitably catch the ball deep in their own territory with little support from their own players they should either kick the ball downfield or run forward to link up with their backs to start a counter attack
if the full back kicks the ball out the opposition have the line out whereas if they start a counter attack they have a number of options
to provide effective cover behind the defensive line good full backs are careful not to get caught out of position and must anticipate the opposition s play
their position behind the backline allows them to see any holes in the defensive line and they either communicate with the backs to close the gaps up or cover the gaps themselves
the full back has the most potential for attacking the opposition especially from a misdirected kick
if a kick is fielded and there is enough space and support the full back may decide to counter attack by running the ball back towards the opposition
due to their kicking skills in some teams the full back is also responsible for taking the goal kicks
for much of the history of the sport the full back position was almost totally defensive
originally the ball could be kicked directly into touch from any spot on the field with a line out then following at the spot where the ball went into touch
this effectively placed a premium on full backs skills in kicking from hand
the first test tries by full backs in international matches came relatively early in and but it was not until that a full back scored a try in the competition now known as the six nations championship
only three tries had been scored by full backs in the championship prior to
according to rugby historian john griffiths the worldwide adoption of the current law restricting direct kicking into touch in september a law previously used in australia revolutionised full back play
jpr williams of wales was the first full back to regularly score tries after the law change scoring six times in five nations matches in the s
notable full backs include serge blanco who scored tries in tests for france and was known for his counter attacking ability
in he was among the inaugural set of rugby players inducted into the international rugby hall of fame and in he was also inducted into the irb hall of fame
four full backs who played for the british and irish lions are in the international rugby hall of fame gavin hastings also inducted into the irb hall in and andy irvine from scotland tom kiernan from ireland and the aforementioned williams
hastings and irvine were accurate goal kickers and kiernan is credited with being the first attacking full back in irish rugby
williams was chosen as the greatest lions full back at the inaugural lions legends dinner at lord s in and is praised for his safety under the high ball tackling and calm decision making
the other full backs in the international rugby hall of fame are don clarke and george n pia from new zealand
clarke nicknamed the boot was an accurate goal kicker and n pia was noted for his tackling and kicking ability
the wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline with the number on the left and the number on the right
their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries
wingers are usually the fastest players in the team and are either elusive runners or more recently big strong and able to break tackles
the skills needed for the left wing and right wing are similar although left footed players are usually played on the left wing as they can step and kick better off their left foot
the winger on the blindside often comes off the wing to provide an extra man in the midfield in the same vein as a full back
one or both wingers will usually drop back on opposition kicks to give the full back extra options for counter attacking
there are a number of notable wings throughout history
david campese a member of both the international and irb halls of fame played times for australia and held the world record for most tries in test matches
he was famous for his goose step and reverse pass
welsh international gerald davies was influential in helping the british lions become the only lions touring party to win a test series in new zealand
ieuan evans played games for wales and scored tries at that time a record for wales
in international rugby hall of famer john kirwan retired as the then most capped player and highest try scorer in all black history
tony o reilly played wing for ireland between and and scored a record tries on two lions tours
andr boniface is a french international that is a member of both the international rugby hall of fame and the irb hall of fame
also in the irb hall of fame is bill maclagan a th century player for scotland and the lions who played at three quarters which eventually evolved into the modern position of wing
another inductee in the irb hall is brian lima of samoa who played most of his career on the wing but ended it as a centre
he participated in five world cups for manu samoa and became known as the chiropractor for his ferocious tackling
in demi sakata a japan star who was considered one of the world s top players of the s became his country s first inductee into the irb hall
jonah lomu entered the international hall in and the irb hall of fame in debuted as the youngest ever all black
there are two centres in a rugby team inside centre number and outside centre number
the inside centre usually stands close to the fly half or at first receiver on the other side of the scrum or breakdown
like the fly half they generally possess a good kicking game and are good at reading the play and directing the attack
the outside centre is positioned outside the inside centre and is generally the faster of the two
the centres main role is to provide space for the players outside them
they need to run good lines run into spaces or at degrees to their opposition be able to side step and swerve and have good passing skills
when the ball is moved along the opposition backline the centres are the first players to make the tackle
they need to be aggressive tacklers to knock their opponent down and seize the ball and be good at organising the defensive lines
outside centres generally have more room to move than inside centres
centres also provide support at the breakdowns and can run as decoys to confuse the defence
brian o driscoll is the fourth most capped player in rugby union history having played test matches for ireland as captain and for the british and irish lions
he is the th highest try scorer in international rugby union history and the highest scoring centre of all time
danie gerber played centre for south africa during the apartheid era and even though he was only able to play tests over years he scored tries
mike gibson played for ireland and the lions his record of caps for ireland lasted for years
tim horan won two world cups for australia being named the player of the tournament in
as a player ian mcgeechan won caps for scotland and went on two lions tours while as a coach he led the lions a record four times
welsh centre gwyn nicholls played from to and was known as the prince of threequarters
other centres in the international rugby hall of fame are jo maso and philippe sella from france known for their flamboyant attacking play
gibson and sella are also in the irb hall of fame
seven centres are in the irb hall but not the international hall frank hancock a th century welsh player whose skills led to the creation of the modern two centre formation guy boniface french international and younger brother of andr brothers donald and ian campbell of chile zimbabwe international richard tsimba and bleddyn williams and jack matthews who formed a legendary centre partnership for cardiff and wales in the era immediately following world war ii
a fly half is crucial to a team s game plan they possess leadership and order the back line
they are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum half following a breakdown line out or scrum and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs
good fly halves are calm clear thinking and have the vision to direct effective attacking plays
fly halves need good passing and kicking skills
often the fly half is the best kicker in the team and needs to be able to execute attacking kicks such as up and unders grubbers and chip kicks as well as being able to kick for territory
many fly halves are also the team s goal kickers
fly halves in the international rugby hall of fame include cliff morgan as well as fellow welshman phil bennett the latter of whom unleashed two great sidesteps to set up what some have described as the greatest try of all time
south african naas botha scored points including a record drop goals despite playing most of his career when the springboks were boycotted
australia s mark ella used his vision passing skills and game management to orchestrate a new flat back attacking style
grant fox was one of the most respected goal kickers who scored more than points in all matches for new zealand
barry john was known simply as the king to welsh rugby fans and was rated third in the bbc sports personality of the year award
jack kyle is widely considered ireland s greatest player
michael lynagh took over fly half from ella and in his first test in that position scored an australian record of points against canada
bennie osler played for south africa from until during which he played a south african record of consecutive games and scored a then world record of points in one game against new zealand
hugo porta is regarded as one of the finest players that argentina has produced and has been a member of the laureus world sports academy since
of the players mentioned above ella kyle morgan osler and porta are members of the irb hall of fame
four fly halves are in the irb hall but not the international hall
gareth rees of canada played in all of the first four rugby world cups and remains the country s all time leading test points scorer
kennedy tsimba of zimbabwe younger brother of the aforementioned richard only played four times for his country but was one of the world s top fly halves in the early st century twice being named the player of the year in south africa s domestic currie cup
he was also the first black player to captain the zimbabwe national team
thomas lawton snr an australian inducted in was one of the leading fly halves of the s and early s
the scrum half is the link between the forwards and the backs
they receive the ball from the line out and remove the ball from the back of the scrum usually passing it to the fly half
they also feed the scrum
along with the fly half they make many of the tactical decisions on the field
during general play the scrum half is generally the player who receives the ball from the forwards and passes it to the backs
they are good communicators especially at directing the forwards around and their aim is to provide the backs with clean ball
good scrum halves have an excellent pass a good tactical kick and are deceptive runners
at defensive scrums they put pressure on the opposition scrum half or defend the blindside
on defence in open play they generally cover for deep kicks after the ball has been passed wide
traditionally scrum halves have been the smallest players on the team but many modern scrum halves are a similar size to the other players in the team
five scrum halves are members of the international rugby hall of fame four of them are also in the irb hall of fame
ken catchpole of australia was made captain on his debut at in and went on to captain the wallabies in nearly half of his tests
danie craven from south africa was one of the greatest scrum halves in the s and a respected administrator of the south african rugby board
gareth edwards played for wales and the british and irish lions during the s and is regarded by many as the greatest player in history
nick farr jones captained australia through their rugby world cup winning campaign he was enshrined in the international hall in
when joost van der westhuizen retired in he had caps at the time the most for any south african
of these players only van der westhuizen is not in the irb hall
three scrum halves are in the irb hall but not the international hall
new zealander david kirk inducted in was captain of the all blacks team that won the inaugural rugby world cup
fellow inductee agust n pichot who played in three world cups for argentina is perhaps best known as the pumas captain during their surprise run to third place in the world cup which eventually led to their entry into the rugby championship previously the tri nations
australian george gregan inducted in retired from international rugby in with a then world record test caps and also captained the wallabies times
the back row or loose forwards consists of three players two flankers one on either side of the scrum and a number eight at the back of the scrum
the number eight or eighthman in south africa binds between the locks at the back of the scrum providing extra weight at the push
number eights interact with the scrum half at the back of the scrum to control and provide clean ball for the backs
they can also pick the ball from the back of the scrum and run with it or pass it to the scrum half
at line outs they can be either another jumper or a lifter
around the field they have a similar set of responsibilities as the flankers at the breakdown
number eights are often strong ball carriers and run off the backs in an attempt to break through or push past the opposition s defensive line
number eights in the international rugby hall of fame include mervyn davies wales and british and irish lions morne du plessis south africa brian lochore new zealand and hennie muller south africa
the flanker s role is to tackle the opposition and try to steal the ball
the openside flanker binds to the side of the scrum that covers the greatest area while the blindside covers the side nearest the side line
they bind loosely to the side of the scrum but still play an important role in keeping the props tight by pushing at an angle
they should be the first forward to a breakdown from a scrum or line out and are expected to link with the backline or secure the ball at the tackle
both positions have a high workrate meaning the players need to be fit fast and good at reading the opposition s attacking plays
during open play if they have not made the tackle they usually stand in the loose next to the ruck or maul
this allows them to arrive quickly at the next tackle
the blindside is generally the larger of the two and usually acts as a third jumping option at the line out
the openside flanker is usually faster than the blindside with good opensides excellent at turning over the ball at the tackle
teams often use their openside flankers to charge the opposition fly half putting pressure on him and forcing him to rush his decision making kicking or passing
blindside flankers also have the task of stopping any attempt by the opposition eighth man to run with the ball around the blindside of a scrum
flankers in the international rugby hall of fame include dave gallaher michael jones ian kirkpatrick graham mourie all new zealand francois pienaar south africa jean prat france jean pierre rives france fergus slattery ireland and lions and wavell wakefield england
pienaar and prat are also members of the irb hall of fame
the locks form the second row
they scrummage by pushing against the front row thereby providing much of the power and are commonly known as the engine room
they are almost always the tallest players in a team and are the primary targets when the ball is thrown in at line outs
locks must also have good catching and tackling ability
at the line out the locks are lifted and supported by teammates allowing them to compete for the ball either passing or tapping it to the scrumhalf or setting up a drive
in scrums the two locks bind tightly together and each put their heads between a prop and the hooker
they compete for the kick offs and are involved in securing the ball in rucks and mauls
they commonly make short runs carrying the ball into contact sometimes known as crash balls
locks in the international rugby hall of fame include bill beaumont england and lions gordon brown scotland and lions frik du preez south africa john eales australia martin johnson england and lions brian lochore new zealand willie john mcbride ireland and lions and colin meads new zealand
du preez eales johnson and mcbride are also members of the irb hall of fame as players lochore was inducted into the irb hall primarily as a coach
three locks are members of the irb hall of fame but not the international hall fairy heatlie a south african great of the era around who was also one of the first argentina internationals french international lucien mias and early th century scottish international david bedell sivright
the hooker is positioned between the two props in the scrum and generally throws the ball into the line out
after the scrumhalf has put the ball into the scrum the hookers use their feet to hook the ball back and win possession for their team
hookers generally have a short back and long arms to aid in binding to the props
when the opposition is putting the ball into the scrum the hooker will either attempt to win the ball or try to disrupt the scrum
hookers are usually more mobile than the props and are often used to carry the ball up during open play
only specialist front row players can play hooker if a team cannot field one for any reason the scrums will become uncontested
hookers in the international rugby hall of fame include sean fitzpatrick new zealand and keith wood ireland and lions
two hookers are members of the irb hall but not the international hall
john smit of south africa captain of the world cup winning springboks in was inducted in
ronnie dawson of ireland and the lions was inducted in
he earned caps for ireland and appeared times for the lions from to captaining the lions in six tests after his playing career ended he became the first head coach of ireland and still later served as president of the irfu and chairman of the irb council
the props prop up the hooker in the scrum
they form part of the front row of the scrum and push against the opposition s props
the loosehead prop is positioned to the left of the hooker and their head will be on the outside of the scrum when it engages
the tighthead is to the right of the hooker with their head positioned between the opposition hooker and the opposition loosehead prop
the prop s main role is to provide stability at the scrum and support the hooker in quickly winning the ball
at the line out the prop s role is to support the jumper as they compete for the ball
they are usually positioned at the front of the line out with a jumper in between them
they are also often involved in lifting jumpers when receiving kick offs
while scrummaging is still seen as their main responsibility modern props are also expected to contribute in the attack and defence
props have to take in pressure from the locks and loose forwards pushing from behind and the opposition pushing against them so they are often among the strongest players in a team
some of the more successful props have short necks and broad shoulders to absorb this force as well as powerful legs to drive the scrum forward
since the game has become professional non specialist props or hookers cannot play in the front row
if through sendings off or injuries a team does not have enough specialist front row players the scrums become uncontested i e
no pushing is allowed and the team putting the ball into the scrum wins it
on their own scrum the loosehead s role is to provide the hooker with a clear view to strike the ball while the tighthead tries to keep the scrum stable
when the opposition is putting the ball in the tighthead attempts to disrupt the opposing hooker or loosehead making it difficult for them to win the ball
props in the international rugby hall of fame include jason leonard england and lions syd millar ireland and lions and wilson whineray new zealand
players who have the ability to play a number of positions in a team are called utility players
utility players can be seen as jack of all trades and they generally occupy the reserve position in a team
for this reason many try to avoid being labelled as utilities
players in the forward positions are generally more specialised than those that play in the backs
however flankers can usually play number eight like gr gory alldritt david pocock and kieran read
many players may also be capable of playing lock as well as a back row position with several modern examples being s bastien chabal maro itoje courtney lawes steven luatua and cameron woki all with international caps in both rows of the scrum
the front row positions are usually very specialised although some props can play both sides or even hooker
south african captain and irb hall of fame member john smit has played test matches in every front row position
another irb hall member to have played multiple forward positions is inductee john thornett an australian utility forward who played at flanker number lock and prop for the wallabies from to
utility backs tend to cover a greater number of positions with players commonly switching between scrum half and fly half fly half and centre or wing and full back
another famous utility player was austin healey who started and played test matches for england and club matches for leicester tigers at fly half scrum half full back and winger
among members of the international rugby or irb halls of fame mike gibson has caps at fly half at centre and on the wing and tim horan played tests at centre on the wing and at full back
danie craven mostly played at half back but has also started a test in the forwards at number
matt giteau has also shown great versatility throughout his career played tests at scrum half at fly half at centre and one on the wing
irb hall inductee waisale serevi although most famous as a sevens player and primarily a fly half in s also started tests as a scrum half wing and full back and came off the bench once as a centre and once as an emergency lock
notable examples in new zealand include daniel bowden luke mcalister and cory jane but australia also has many utility backs like adam ashley cooper kurtley beale and james o connor
south africans johan goosen and fran ois steyn such as french thomas ramos j r my sinzelle or damien traille can be mentioned
rugby sevens teams have only seven players on the field and can nominate five substitutes
the seven players are split into three forwards and four backs
scrums are formed with three players who bind together the same as the front row
there are four backs scrum half fly half centre and wing
the scrum half feeds the ball into the scrum
the other three players form the backline
since play is much more open in sevens with rucks and mauls generally kept to a minimum most sevens players are backs or loose forwards in fifteen a side teams
when a team is defending in open play or from a penalty kick the defending team will often play a line of six defenders across the field with one player deeper known as the sweeper whose role is to field kicks or to tackle attacking players who have broken through the defensive line
