The first municipal building in the town was a medieval guildhall which dated back to the early th century Following the siege of Wallingford in a skirmish in the English Civil War at which many of the town's buildings were damaged or destroyed by the attacking roundhead forces the borough council decided to demolish the old guildhall The site selected for the new building to the south of St Mary le More Church was purchased from a local landowner James Leaver The new building was designed in the neoclassical style built using timber frame construction techniques with a stucco finish and was completed in
The design involved a symmetrical main frontage facing onto the Market Square the ground floor was arcaded with a series of Doric order columns so that markets could be held On the first floor there was a central Venetian window with a wrought iron balcony and in the attic there was a smaller Venetian style dormer window The side elevations stretched back five bays on each side and were fenestrated by sash windows with architraves and cornices Above there was a modillioned cornice surmounted by a hipped roof with a weather vane Internally the principal rooms were the main chamber and the committee room both on the first floor A lock up for petty criminals was established in the basement
From an early stage the main chamber was used for hearings of the borough courts and of the court of quarter sessions while the attic was used as a school room In the late th century the attic was used by the local congregational church until their chapel in the market place was completed in Markets were held on the ground floor until the corn exchange was built to the east of the town hall in Alterations were carried out in as part of the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria to remove the attic and to create a coved ceiling in the main chamber A war memorial in the form of a plinth supporting a figure of a woman holding a wreath and intended to commemorate the lives of local service personnel who had died in the First World War was unveiled outside the town hall by the Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire James Benyon on May In the rear two bays were infilled at ground floor level and extended out to the west on both floors An external flight of steps was added in front of the extension leading up to a doorway on the first floor which gave access to the extension
In September during the Second World War two Royal Canadian Air Force officers Flying Officer John Wilding and Sergeant John Andrew remained at the controls of a burning Halifax bomber of No Squadron RCAF which was returning from an abandoned raid over the French port of Le Havre and steered it away from Wallingford saving many civilian lives The two airmen who died in the ensuing air crash at Newnham Murren were commemorated after the borough council decided to fly the Canadian flag over Wallingford Town Hall every year on September in their memory
