google image labeler is a feature in the form of a game of google images that allows the user to label random images to help improve the quality of google s image search results
it was online from to and relaunched in
luis von ahn developed the esp game a game in which two people were simultaneously given an image with no way to communicate other than knowing the matching label for each picture or the pass signal
the esp game had been licensed by google in the form of the google image labeler and launched this service as a beta on august
players noticed various subtle changes in the game over time
in the earliest months through about november players could see each other s guesses during play by mousing over the image
when congenita abuse started see below the player could see if his or her partner was using those terms while the game was underway
the game was changed so that only at the end of the game could a player click see partner s guesses and learn what he or she had typed
congenita abuse was finally stopped by changes in the structure of the game in february
during the first few months of regular players grew to recognize a group of images that signified a robot partner always with the same labels in the same order
this appeared to have changed as of about march
suddenly most of the images seen were brand new and the older images came with extensive off limits lists
by may there had been fundamental and substantial changes made to the game
instead of seconds players had minutes
instead of points per image the score was varied to reward higher specificity
man might get points whereas bill gates might get points
on august another change was made instead of simply showing the point values of each match as the match occurs the value of each match was shown next to the matching word at the end of the game
this made it much easier to see the exact value of specific versus general labeling
a further change was observed on october
the new version was put into place and then seemed to have been withdrawn
in the new version players saw only the image he or she was labeling whereas in the old version the images were collected in the lower part of the screen as the game was being played
other changes were subtle for example the score was in green letters in the new version and red in the old
the most significant change was that the clock froze during the image change and that time used to be essentially subtracted from the two minutes of play
the changes appeared to have gone into full effect on october
in september google announced it would discontinue a number of its products including google image labeler aardvark desktop fast flip and google pack
the game ended on september to the discontent of many of its users
the idea of the game survives as an art annotation game in artigo
google relaunched image labeler in
the new service is less like a game
the user picks a category and they are shown a set of images
they go through each image and state whether it has been correctly categorised
the user was randomly paired with a partner who was online and using the feature
users could be registered players who accumulated a total score over all games played or guests who played for one game at a time
note that players from around the world were allowed to play and both american and british english would be encountered for example soccer vs
football
when an uneven number of players were online a player would play against a prerecorded set of words
in the most recent version of the game the rules ran as the follows over a two minute period the user and his or her partner were shown the same set of images and asked to provide as many labels as possible to describe each image they saw
when the user s label matched the partner s label both would earn points and move on to the next image until time runs out
it was possible to pass on an image but both users would have to agree to do this
the score was variable from to depending on the specificity of the answer
the score was rare but points were awarded for a name or specific word even if the word was spelled out in the image
terms with low specificity like trees or man earned only points
there was no screening for correctness so if both players typed jupiter for an image of saturn they would presumably both get points
labels that had been agreed on by previous users would show on an off limits list and could not be used in that round
some players thought that the game staggered appearance of the images and that sometimes it took the first words typed by one player to form an off limits list for the other player
in other words the off limits words might be unilateral
this would explain the rather frequent circumstance when it seemed a partner could not think of words like car bird or girl very rarely at the end of the match it would become obvious that one image was different for the two players
one speculation is that this was simply an error while another is that it was a test to see how quickly people would pass when their descriptions did not match
it may also have been a mechanism implemented to view cheaters if the words for the different images were similar
at times one user s computer would fail to load a new image or continue to display the previous image shown
times likes these also called for a mutual pass on the part of both players
after the second time expired the game was over
the user could see the user name of the partner for the first time their score for the game with which both were credited and their individual cumulative score to date
these were compared to the daily high scores for teams and the all time individual high scores
google was betting on users competitiveness to rack up high scores to swell the number of images ranked
the game s end screen also showed all images presented during the game along with the list of labels guessed by the other player
the images themselves then linked to the websites where those images were found and could be explored for more information and to satisfy curiosity
the game was not designed simply for fun it was also a way for google to ensure that its keywords were matched to correct images
each matched word was supposed to help google to build an accurate database used when using the google image search
without human tagging of images google images search has in the past relied on the filename of the image
for example a photo that is captioned portrait of bill gates might have bill gates associated as a possible search term
the google image labeler relied on humans that tag the meaning or content of the image rather than its context looking on at where the image was used
by storing more information about the image google stores more possible avenues of discovering the image in response to a user s search
some users complained that the rules are difficult to decipher
nowhere was it stated for example that a player should press return after typing a label
beginners often made the mistake of typing several terms into the first box not realizing that those words were then all considered together as a phrase
the pass option was also not explained although it meant that the player does not want to rate a word some players thought that this button was to be pressed after making a guess
either of these mistakes could easily result in a zero score while these rules were not explained on the playing screen some were in fact explained on the help page
other issues included
images that would fail to load or load very slowly using time off the clock
images were unnecessarily scaled down then scaled up causing excessive pixilation and blurring
experienced users typed the letter x to avoid simply passing and scoring zero when this happened
note that x nor any other word would not work for two successive images so other terms blank or none could also be utilized since sometimes many images did not load
only six labels appeared on the screen during a round if more were added some scrolled off the top
observation showed that all of these labels counted and with a fast partner one could see nine or ten words for one image
also after hitting pass users would no longer see the count of their partner s labels
if a user continued to type he or she could get a match on words already typed by his or her partner even when said user had passed
if one s partner typed a matching word after the player passed it would not count
scores were typically low when several of the images presented had a number of off limits tags
in some cases the off limits tags were quite extensive or exhaustive making it difficult for both partners to create a novel tag that matches less than a month after the launch the game began to be abused
it appeared that google was getting spammed with words from the following list abrasives accretion bequeathing carcinoma congenita diphosphonate entrepreneurialism forbearance and googley
because players could see the responses of their partner at the end of each round they learned that other players were using these words
some then incorporated these words into their answers for entertainment and increased scores
on or before february google changed the game to cut down on the abuse
the words on the list above were filtered out
also certain images that had become triggers for the random words came with an immediate your partner wants to pass in the game revision of march the trigger images were temporarily removed
a case study of google image labeler looks at how its assumptions about game play and game mechanics led to mistrust from its players some of whom described it as exploitative and deceptive
users were not awarded for labeling images by any means other than points but they may learn new english language words slowly
