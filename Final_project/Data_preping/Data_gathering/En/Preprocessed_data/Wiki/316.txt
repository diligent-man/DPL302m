season one received an overall score of on metacritic based on reviews
alessandra stanley of the new york times wrote the big c works because most of the writing is strong and believable and so is ms
linney who rarely sounds a false note and here has perfect pitch
the series is at its best when sardonic and subdued washington post critic hank stuever said buoyed by scalpel sharp writing and even keener performances the big c walks a fine line of having it both ways
it s for people who are repelled by the warm fuzzy disease o the week dramas of cable television ew com s ken tucker quibbled with its major plot point my big problem with the big c concerns a crucial decision the show made for the early episodes cathy declines to tell those closest to her that she has cancer
while this is one of the many different reactions people have to such a diagnosis in real life in a comedy drama like this it makes everyone around her seem a bit dim
the second season received similar reviews to the first receiving a score of on metacritic based on reviews from critics
maureen ryan of aol tv stated that having a character and her family deal with a potentially fatal illness is such a rich arena for both drama and black comedy but so far the big c hasn t been able to mine that topic with consistent freshness and depth ken tucker of entertainment weekly was critical towards the show but commended the acting stating that much of the big c s unoriginal dramatization of cancer concerns is mitigated by the fresh dynamic performances of laura linney and oliver platt
the third season received a score of on metacritic based on reviews from critics
the fourth and final season consisting of four hour long episodes received a score of on metacritic based on reviews from critics
