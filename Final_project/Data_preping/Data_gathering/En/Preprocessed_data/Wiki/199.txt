a wildlife corridor habitat corridor or green corridor is an area of habitat connecting wildlife populations separated by human activities or structures such as roads development or logging
this allows an exchange of individuals between populations which may help prevent the negative effects of inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity via genetic drift that often occur within isolated populations
corridors may also help facilitate the re establishment of populations that have been reduced or eliminated due to random events such as fires or disease
this may potentially moderate some of the worst effects of habitat fragmentation wherein urbanization can split up habitat areas causing animals to lose both their natural habitat and the ability to move between regions to use all of the resources they need to survive
habitat fragmentation due to human development is an ever increasing threat to biodiversity and habitat corridors are a possible mitigation
the main goal of implementing habitat corridors is to increase biodiversity
when areas of land are broken up by human interference population numbers become unstable and many animal and plant species become endangered
by re connecting the fragments the population fluctuations can decrease dramatically
corridors can contribute to three factors that stabilize a population
colonization animals are able to move and occupy new areas when food sources or other natural resources are lacking in their core habitat
migration species that relocate seasonally can do so more safely and effectively when it does not interfere with human development barriers
interbreeding animals can find new mates in neighbouring regions increasing genetic diversity rosenberg et al
were among the first to define what constitutes a wildlife corridor
the definitions of biological corridor i e wildlife corridor had in the early years of studying corridors been vague and inconsistent and often they confound ed form and function rosenberg et al
developed a conceptual model that emphasized the role of a wildlife corridor as a facilitator of movement that is not restricted by requirements of native vegetation or intermediate target patches of habitat
their definition simply required that movement to a target patch via the corridor be greater than if the corridor were absent
although corridors had originally been implemented with the assumption that they would increase biodiversity not enough research had been done to come to a solid conclusion
the case for corridors had been built more on intuition rather than empirical evidence tewksbury et al
tewksbury et al
claimed that the early controversies had arisen because most studies had been limited in that they had a narrow taxonomic focus and that if corridors facilitate animal movement they should also have strong indirect effects on plant populations due to increased pollen and seed by animals
results of their experiment provided a large scale experimental demonstration that habitat or wildlife corridors facilitate movement of disparate taxa between otherwise isolated patches even after controlling for area effects tewksbury et al
another factor that needs to be taken into account is what species the corridor is intended for
some species have reacted more positively to corridors than others
a habitat corridor could be considered as a possible solution in an area where the destruction of a natural area has greatly affected its native species
development such as roads buildings and farms can interrupt plants and animals in the region being destroyed
furthermore natural disasters such as wildfires and floods can leave animals with no choice but to evacuate
if the habitat is not connected to a safer one it will ultimately lead to death
a remaining portion of natural habitat is called a remnant and to conserve species such portions need to be connected because when migration decreases extinction increases fleury
corridors can be made in two distinct areas either water or land
water corridors are called riparian ribbons and usually come in the form of rivers and streams
land corridors come on a scale as large as wooded strips connecting larger woodland areas
however they can also be as simple as a line of shrubs along a sidewalk fleury
such areas can facilitate the movement of small animals especially birds from tree to tree until they find a safe habitat to rest in
not only do minimal corridors aid in the movement of animals they are also aesthetically pleasing which can sometimes encourage the community to accept and support them
species can be categorized in one of two groups passage users and corridor dwellers
passage users occupy corridors for brief periods of time
these animals use corridors for such events as seasonal migration dispersal of a juvenile or moving between parts of a large home range
usually large herbivores medium to large carnivores and migratory species are passage users
one common misconception is that the corridor only needs to be wide enough for the passage users to get through
however the corridor still must be wide enough to be safe and also encourage the animals to use it even though they do not live out their entire lives in it
corridor dwellers can occupy the passage anywhere from several days to several years
species such as plants reptiles amphibians birds insects and small mammals can spend their entire lives in linear habitats
in this case the corridor must include everything that a species needs to live and breed such as soil for germination burrowing areas and multiple other breeding adults
habitat corridors can be categorized according to their width
typically the wider the corridor the more use it will get from species
however the width length ratio as well as design and quality play just as important of a role in creating the perfect corridor fleury
the strip of land will suffer less from edge effects such as weeds predators and chemicals if it is constructed properly
the following are three divisions in corridor widths
regional m wide connect major ecological gradients such as migratory pathways
sub regional m wide connect larger vegetated landscape features such as ridgelines and valley floors
local some m connect remnant patches of gullies wetlands ridgelines etc habitat corridors can also be divided according to their continuity
continuous corridors are strips that are not broken up while stepping stone corridors are small patches of suitable habitat
when stepping stones are arranged in a line they form a strip of land connecting two areas just like a continuous corridor
some kinds provide linkages between protected core areas and stimulate or allow species to migrate
corridors can also be miniature in the form of wildlife crossings
underpasses or overpasses used for crossing a man made feature such as highways
they improve safety for both animals and humans
many busy highways cross through natural habitats that native species occupy as well
large animals such as deer become a hazard when they cross in front of traffic and get hit
an overpass or an underpass serves as a bridge to facilitate the movement of animals across a busy road
observations have shown that underpasses are actually more successful than overpasses because many times animals are too timid to cross over a bridge in front of traffic and would prefer to be more hidden dole et al
corridors can be expensive to plan out and put into action
for example daniel simberloff et al
states that a bridge that would maintain a riparian corridor costs about times as much per lane mile as would a road that would sever the corridor he also states that maintenance of a corridor would be much more costly than refuges for endangered species
it would simply be easier to move animals between refuges than to buy land install a corridor and maintain it
however where the goal is not just to preserve a few large animal species but to protect biodiversity among all plants and animals then habitat corridors may be the only option
corridors are going to be expensive to implement no matter what but it does depend on the type location and size which can all vary to a great degree
with the lack of field data on the effectiveness many agencies are not willing to consider putting in corridors
researchers must pay attention to the population changes in animals after a corridor has been implemented to ensure that there are no harmful effects
researchers can use both mark recapture techniques and evaluate genetic flow in order to observe how much a corridor is being used
marking and recapturing animals is more useful when keeping a close eye on individual movement
however tagging animals and watching them does not give any data on whether the migrating individuals are successfully mating with other populations in connected areas of land
genetic techniques can be more effective in evaluating migration and mating patterns
one of the most important goals of developing a corridor is to increase migration in certain animal species
by looking at a population s gene flow researchers can understand the genetic consequences of corridors via information about the migration patterns of an entire population instead of the movements of a few individuals
from these techniques researchers can better understand whether or not habitat corridors are increasing biodiversity
stephen mech and james hallett introduce an additional reason genetic techniques are more useful they measure average migration rates over time which reveals the effects of fragmentation of several generations and is not as sensitive to current population sizes as mark recapture studies are for example when a population is extremely small mark recapture is almost impossible
according to new research wildlife corridors are best built with a certain degree of randomness or asymmetry rather than built symmetrically
the research was conducted at the university of california davis
wildlife corridors are susceptible to edge effects habitat quality along the edge of a habitat fragment is often much lower than in core habitat areas
wildlife corridors are important for large species requiring significant sized ranges however they are also vital as connection corridors for smaller animals and plants as well as ecological connectors to provide a rescue effect
both the safety of animals and humans can be achieved through the creation of corridors
in alberta canada an overpass was constructed to keep animals off the busy highway which crosses a national park
the top of the bridge is covered in the native grass of the area
fences were also put on either side of the overpass to help guide animals in the right direction
in southern california underpasses and drainage culverts were observed to see how many animals used them as corridors
they proved to be especially effective on wide ranging species such as carnivores mule deer small mammals and reptiles even though the corridors were not intended specifically for animals
researchers also learned that factors such as surrounding habitat underpass dimensions and human activity also played a role in how much use they got
from this experiment much was learned about what would constitute a successful habitat corridor
in south carolina five remnant areas of land were monitored one was put in the center and four were surrounding it
then a corridor was put between one of the remnants and the center
butterflies that were placed in the center habitat were two to four times more likely to move to the connected remnant rather than the disconnected ones
furthermore male holly plants were placed in the center region and female holly plants in the connected region increased by percent in seed production compared to those plants in the disconnected region
the most impressive dispersal into the connected region though was through bird droppings
far more plant seeds were dispersed through bird droppings in the corridor connected patch of land
there have also been positive effects on the rates of transfer and interbreeding in vole populations
a control population in which voles were confined to their core habitat with no corridor was compared to a treatment population in their core habitat with passages that they could use to move to other regions
females typically stayed and mated within their founder population but the rate of transfer through corridors in the males was very high
researchers are not sure why the females did not move about as much but it is apparent that the corridor effectively transferred at least some of the species to another location for breeding
in a wolf corridor was restored through a golf course in jasper national park alberta which enabled wolves to pass through the course
after this restoration wolves passed through the corridor frequently
this is one of the first demonstrations that corridors are used by wildlife and can be effective in decreasing fragmentation
earlier studies had been criticised for failing to demonstrate that corridor restoration leads to a change in wildlife behaviour
elephant corridors are narrow strips of land that allow elephants to move from one habitat patch to another
there are identified elephant corridors in india
in africa botswana houses the largest number of free roaming elephant herds
elephants without borders ewb studies the movement of elephants is working to gain community support of local community corridors so that elephants and humans can co exist

the siju rewak corridor located in the garo hills of india protects an important population of elephants thought to be approximately of all the elephants that survive in the country
this corridor project links together the siju wildlife sanctuary and the rewak reserve forest in meghalaya state close to the india bangladesh border
this area lies within the meeting place of the himalayan mountain range and the indian peninsula and contains at least other species of mammal including tiger clouded leopard and the himalayan black bear

terai arc landscapes lower himalayan region some animal species are much more apt to use habitat corridors than others depending on what their migration and mating patterns are like
for example many cases of birds and butterflies successfully using corridors have been observed
less successful stories have come out of mammals such as deer
how effective a corridor is may simply rely on what species it is directed towards
corridors created with birds in mind may be more successful because they are highly migratory to begin with
human interference is almost inevitable with the quickly increasing population
the goal behind habitat corridors shows the most hope for solving habitat fragmentation and restoring biodiversity as much as possible
although there are many positives and negatives there may be enough positives to continue studying and improving corridors
it is truly difficult to say whether corridors are the solution to increasing biodiversity because each one must be judged on its own
each corridor has its own set of standards and goals that may set it apart from another one
a major downfall to habitat corridors is that not much information has been gathered about their success
due to the lack of positive data many agencies will not allow corridors to be established because they are unsure of their effectiveness
another problem with corridors is that they are not as useful as simply preserving land so that it cannot be fragmented
however it is becoming very difficult to set aside land for nature reserves when road building industry and urban sprawl are all competing for space
even if corridors are sought as a solution it does not necessarily mean that animals will use them
especially in the case of overpasses research shows that animals do not like to use them to get to another remnant area of land
usually overpasses are built over busy highways and many species are too timid to expose themselves in front of all of the traffic
as more roads and buildings arise there becomes less space to try to preserve
habitat corridors need to be species specific not every kind of animal will use every kind of corridor and corridors can be barriers to some species
for instance plants may use road verges as corridors however some mammals will not cross roads to reach a suitable habitat
when a corridor is implemented many times development is so close by that it becomes difficult to build a wide enough passage
there is usually a very limited amount of space available for corridors so buffers are not usually added in
without a buffer zone corridors become susceptible to harmful outside factors from city streets suburb development rural homes forestry cropland and feedlots
unfortunately another limiting factor to the implementation of corridors is money
with such inconclusive data about the effectiveness of connecting land it is difficult to get the proper funding
those who would be in charge of the corridor design and construction would ask such questions as what if the corridors affect species negatively and what if they actually aid in the spread of disease and catastrophic events furthermore there is a possibility that corridors could not only aid in the dispersal of native organisms but invasive ones as well
if invasive species take over an area they could potentially threaten another species even to the point of extinction
although wildlife corridors have been proposed as solutions to habitat and wildlife population fragmentation there is little evidence that they are broadly useful as a conservation strategy for all biodiversity in non developed or less developed areas compared to protecting connectivity as the relevant ecological attribute
in other words corridors may be a useful meme for conservation planning ers but the concept has less meaning to wildlife species themselves
very few wildlife follow easily identified corridors or linkages e g using computer modeling instead most species meander and opportunistically move through landscapes during daily seasonal and dispersal movement behavior
wildlife corridors may be useful in highly developed landscapes where they are easily identified as the last remaining and available habitat
habitat corridors may be defenseless against a number of outside influences but they are still an efficient way of increasing biodiversity
strips of land aid in the movement of various animal species and pollen and seed dispersal which is an added benefit to the intended one
for example when insects carrying pollen or birds carrying seeds travel to another area plant species effectively get transported as well
another positive aspect of corridors is that they allow both animals and humans to occupy virtually the same areas of land and thus co exist where without the corridor this would not be possible
large animals such as bears can be attracted to residential areas in search of food due to lack of natural resources because of habitat fragmentation
a corridor would provide a passage for the bears to forage in other locations so that they would not pose as much of a threat to humans
