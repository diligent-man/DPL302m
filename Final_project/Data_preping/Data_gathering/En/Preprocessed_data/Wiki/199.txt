wildlife corridor habitat corridor green corridor area habitat connecting wildlife population separated human activity structure road development logging
allows exchange individual population may help prevent negative effect inbreeding reduced genetic diversity via genetic drift often occur within isolated populations
corridor may also help facilitate re-establishment population reduced eliminated due random event fire disease
may potentially moderate worst effect habitat fragmentation wherein urbanization split habitat area causing animal lose natural habitat ability move region use resource need survive
habitat fragmentation due human development ever-increasing threat biodiversity habitat corridor possible mitigation
area land broken human interference population number become unstable many animal plant specie become endangered
colonizationanimals able move occupy new area food source natural resource lacking core habitat
migrationspecies relocate seasonally safely effectively doe interfere human development barriers
interbreedinganimals find new mate neighbouring region increasing genetic diversityrosenberg et al
definition biological corridor ie wildlife corridor early year studying corridor vague inconsistent often confounded form function rosenberg et al
developed conceptual model emphasized role wildlife corridor facilitator movement restricted requirement native vegetation intermediate target patch habitat
definition simply required movement target patch via corridor greater corridor absent
although corridor originally implemented assumption would increase biodiversity enough research done come solid conclusion
case corridor built intuition rather empirical evidence tewksbury et al
claimed early controversy arisen study limited narrow taxonomic focus corridor facilitate animal movement also strong indirect effect plant population due increased pollen seed animals
result experiment provided large-scale experimental demonstration habitat wildlife corridor facilitate movement disparate taxon otherwise isolated patch even controlling area effect tewksbury et al
another factor need taken account specie corridor intended for
habitat corridor could considered possible solution area destruction natural area ha greatly affected native species
development road building farm interrupt plant animal region destroyed
furthermore natural disaster wildfire flood leave animal choice evacuate
remaining portion natural habitat called remnant conserve specie portion need connected migration decrease extinction increase fleury
water corridor called riparian ribbon usually come form river streams
land corridor come scale large wooded strip connecting larger woodland areas
however also simple line shrub along sidewalk fleury
area facilitate movement small animal especially bird tree tree find safe habitat rest in
minimal corridor aid movement animal also aesthetically pleasing sometimes encourage community accept support them
specie categorized one two group passage user corridor dwellers
animal use corridor event seasonal migration dispersal juvenile moving part large home range
usually large herbivore medium large carnivore migratory specie passage users
one common misconception corridor need wide enough passage user get through
however corridor still must wide enough safe also encourage animal use even though live entire life it
corridor dweller occupy passage anywhere several day several years
specie plant reptile amphibian bird insect small mammal spend entire life linear habitats
case corridor must include everything specie need live breed soil germination burrowing area multiple breeding adults
however width-length ratio well design quality play important role creating perfect corridor fleury
strip land suffer le edge effect weed predator chemical constructed properly
regional wide connect major ecological gradient migratory pathways
sub-regional wide connect larger vegetated landscape feature ridgeline valley floors
local connect remnant patch gully wetland ridgeline etchabitat corridor also divided according continuity
continuous corridor strip broken stepping stone corridor small patch suitable habitat
stepping stone arranged line form strip land connecting two area like continuous corridor
kind provide linkage protected core area stimulate allow specie migrate
many busy highway cross natural habitat native specie occupy well
large animal deer become hazard cross front traffic get hit
overpass underpass serf bridge facilitate movement animal across busy road
observation shown underpass actually successful overpass many time animal timid cross bridge front traffic would prefer hidden dole et al
state bridge would maintain riparian corridor cost time much per lane-mile would road would sever corridor also state maintenance corridor would much costly refuge endangered species
would simply easier move animal refuge buy land install corridor maintain it
however goal preserve large animal specie protect biodiversity among plant animal habitat corridor may option
corridor going expensive implement matter doe depend type location size vary great degree
lack field data effectiveness many agency willing consider putting corridors
researcher must pay attention population change animal corridor ha implemented ensure harmful effects
researcher use mark-recapture technique evaluate genetic flow order observe much corridor used
marking recapturing animal useful keeping close eye individual movement
however tagging animal watching doe give data whether migrating individual successfully mating population connected area land
one important goal developing corridor increase migration certain animal species
looking population's gene flow researcher understand genetic consequence corridor via information migration pattern entire population instead movement individuals
technique researcher better understand whether habitat corridor increasing biodiversity
stephen mech james hallett introduce additional reason genetic technique useful measure average migration rate time reveals effect fragmentation several generation sensitive current population size mark-recapture study example population extremely small mark-recapture almost impossible
according new research wildlife corridor best built certain degree randomness asymmetry rather built symmetrically
wildlife corridor susceptible edge effect habitat quality along edge habitat fragment often much lower core habitat areas
wildlife corridor important large specie requiring significant sized range however also vital connection corridor smaller animal plant well ecological connector provide rescue effect
alberta canada overpass wa constructed keep animal busy highway cross national park
fence also put either side overpass help guide animal right direction
southern california underpass drainage culvert observed see many animal used corridors
proved especially effective wide-ranging specie carnivore mule deer small mammal reptile even though corridor intended specifically animals
researcher also learned factor surrounding habitat underpass dimension human activity also played role much use got
experiment much wa learned would constitute successful habitat corridor
south carolina five remnant area land monitored one wa put center four surrounding it
butterfly placed center habitat two four time likely move connected remnant rather disconnected ones
furthermore male holly plant placed center region female holly plant connected region increased percent seed production compared plant disconnected region
impressive dispersal connected region though wa bird droppings
far plant seed dispersed bird droppings corridor-connected patch land
also positive effect rate transfer interbreeding vole populations
control population vole confined core habitat corridor wa compared treatment population core habitat passage could use move regions
female typically stayed mated within founder population rate transfer corridor male wa high
researcher sure female move much apparent corridor effectively transferred least specie another location breeding
wolf corridor wa restored golf course jasper national park alberta enabled wolf pas course

terai arc landscape lower himalayan regionsome animal specie much apt use habitat corridor others depending migration mating pattern like
example many case bird butterfly successfully using corridor observed
effective corridor may simply rely specie directed towards
corridor created bird mind may successful highly migratory begin with
goal behind habitat corridor show hope solving habitat fragmentation restoring biodiversity much possible
although many positive negative may enough positive continue studying improving corridors
truly difficult say whether corridor solution increasing biodiversity one must judged own
corridor ha set standard goal may set apart another one
major downfall habitat corridor much information ha gathered success
due lack positive data many agency allow corridor established unsure effectiveness
another problem corridor useful simply preserving land cannot fragmented
however becoming difficult set aside land nature reserve road-building industry urban sprawl competing space
even corridor sought solution doe necessarily mean animal use them
especially case overpass research show animal like use get another remnant area land
usually overpass built busy highway many specie timid expose front traffic
road building arise becomes le space try preserve
habitat corridor need species-specific every kind animal use every kind corridor corridor barrier species
instance plant may use road verge corridor however mammal cross road reach suitable habitat
corridor implemented many time development close becomes difficult build wide enough passage
usually limited amount space available corridor buffer usually added in
without buffer zone corridor become susceptible harmful outside factor city street suburb development rural home forestry cropland feedlots
inconclusive data effectiveness connecting land difficult get proper funding
would charge corridor design construction would ask question corridor affect specie negatively actually aid spread disease catastrophic event furthermore possibility corridor could aid dispersal native organism invasive one well
invasive specie take area could potentially threaten another specie even point extinction
although wildlife corridor proposed solution habitat wildlife population fragmentation little evidence broadly useful conservation strategy biodiversity non-developed less-developed area compared protecting connectivity relevant ecological attribute
word corridor may useful meme conservation planningers concept ha le meaning wildlife specie themselves
wildlife follow easily identified corridor linkage eg using computer modeling instead specie meander opportunistically move landscape daily seasonal dispersal movement behavior
wildlife corridor may useful highly developed landscape easily identified last remaining available habitat
habitat corridor may defenseless number outside influence still efficient way increasing biodiversity
strip land aid movement various animal specie pollen seed dispersal added benefit intended one
example insect carrying pollen bird carrying seed travel another area plant specie effectively get transported well
another positive aspect corridor allow animal human occupy virtually area land thus co-exist without corridor would possible
large animal bear attracted residential area search food due lack natural resource habitat fragmentation
corridor would provide passage bear forage location would pose much threat humans
