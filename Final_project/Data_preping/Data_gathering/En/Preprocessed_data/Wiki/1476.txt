smithfield properly known as west smithfield is a district located in central london part of farringdon without the most westerly ward of the city of london england
smithfield is home to a number of city institutions such as st bartholomew s hospital and livery halls including those of the butchers and haberdashers companies
the area is best known for the smithfield meat market which dates from the th century has been in continuous operation since medieval times and is now london s only remaining wholesale market
smithfield s principle street is called west smithfield and the area also contains london s oldest surviving church st bartholomew the great founded in ad
the area has borne witness to many executions of heretics and political rebels over the centuries as well as scottish knight sir william wallace and wat tyler leader of the peasants revolt among many other religious reformers and dissenters
smithfield market a grade ii listed covered market building was designed by victorian architect sir horace jones in the second half of the th century and is the dominant architectural feature of the area
some of its original market premises fell into disuse in the late th century and faced the prospect of demolition
the corporation of london s public enquiry in drew widespread support for an urban regeneration plan intent upon preserving smithfield s historical identity
in the middle ages it was a broad grassy area known as smooth field located beyond london wall stretching to the eastern bank of the river fleet
given its ease of access to grazing and water smithfield established itself as london s livestock market remaining so for almost years
many local toponyms are associated with the livestock trade while some street names such as cow cross street and cock lane remain in use many more such as chick lane duck lane cow lane pheasant court goose alley have disappeared from the map after the major redevelopment of the area in the victorian era
in the area near aldersgate was granted by king henry i for the foundation of st bartholomew s priory at the request of prior rahere in thanks for his being nursed back to good health
the priory exercised its right to enclose land between the vicinity of the boundary with aldersgate without to the east long lane to the north and modern day newgate street to the south erecting its main western gate which opened onto smithfield and a postern on long lane
by facing the open space of smithfield and by having its back to the buildings lining aldersgate street the priory site has left a continuing legacy of limited connectivity between the smithfield area and aldersgate street
the priory thereafter held the manorial rights to hold weekly fairs which initially took place in its outer court on the site of present day cloth fair leading to fair gate
an additional annual celebration the bartholomew fair was established in by the augustinian friars
over time this became one of london s pre eminent summer fairs opening each year on august
a trading event for cloth and other goods as well as being a pleasure forum the four day festival drew crowds from all strata of english society
in however the city authorities closed bartholomew fair as they considered it to have degenerated into a magnet for debauchery and public disorder
in walter de manny rented acres km of land at spital croft north of long lane from the master and brethren of st bartholomew s hospital for a graveyard and plague pit for victims of the black death
a chapel and hermitage were constructed renamed new church haw but in this land was granted for the foundation of the charterhouse originally a carthusian monastery
nearby and to the north of this demesne the knights hospitaller established a commandery at clerkenwell dedicated to st john in the mid th century
in they received a charter from king richard i granting the order formal privileges
later augustinian canonesses established the priory of st mary north of the knights of st john property
by the end of the th century these religious houses were regarded by city traders as interlopers occupying what had previously been public open space near one of the city gates
on numerous occasions vandals damaged the charterhouse eventually demolishing its buildings
by a stout wall was built to protect the property and maintain the privacy of the order particularly its church where men and women alike came to worship
the religious houses were dissolved in the reformation and their lands broken up
the priory church of st john remains as does st john s gate
john houghton later canonized by pope paul vi as st john houghton the prior of charterhouse went to thomas cromwell accompanied by two other local priors seeking an oath of supremacy that would be acceptable to their religious institute
communities
instead they were imprisoned in the tower of london and on may they were taken to tyburn and hanged becoming the first catholic martyrs of the reformation
on may the remaining twenty monks and eighteen lay brothers were forced to swear the oath of allegiance to king henry viii the ten who refused were taken to newgate prison and left to starve
with the monks expelled charterhouse was requisitioned and remained as a private dwelling until its reestablishment by thomas sutton in as a charitable foundation it was the basis of the school named charterhouse and almshouses known as sutton s hospital in charterhouse on its former site
the school was relocated to godalming in
until charterhouse was extra parochial that year it became a civil parish incorporated in the metropolitan borough of finsbury
some of the property was damaged during the blitz but it remains largely intact
part of the site is now occupied by barts and the london school of medicine and dentistry
from its inception the priory of st bartholomew treated the sick
after the reformation it was left with neither income nor monastic occupants but following a petition by the city corporation henry viii refounded it in december as the house of the poore in west smithfield in the suburbs of the city of london of henry viii s foundation
letters patent were presented to the city granting property and income to the new foundation the following month
king henry viii s sergeant surgeon thomas vicary was appointed as the hospital s first superintendent
the king henry viii gate which opens onto west smithfield was completed in and remains the hospital s main entrance
the priory s principal church st bartholomew the great was reconfigured after the dissolution of the monasteries losing the western third of its nave
reformed as an anglican parish church its parish boundaries were limited to the site of the ancient priory and a small tract of land between the church and long lane
the parish of st bartholomew the great was designated as a liberty responsible for the upkeep and security of its fabric and the land within its boundaries
with the advent of street lighting mains water and sewerage during the victorian era maintenance of such an ancient parish with so few parishioners became increasingly uneconomical after the industrial revolution
in it agreed to be incorporated by the corporation of london which guaranteed financial support and security
great st barts present parish boundary includes just feet m of smithfield possibly delineating a former right of way
after the reformation a separate parish likewise dedicated to st bartholomew was granted in favour of st bartholomew s hospital named st bartholomew the less it remained under the hospital s patronage unique in the church of england until when the hospital was nationalized in the national health service
the church benefice has since been joined again with its ancient partner the priory church of st bartholomew the great
following the diminished influence of the ancient priory predecessor of the two parishes of st bartholomew disputes began to arise over rights to tithes and taxes payable by lay residents who claimed allegiance with the nearby and anciently associated parish of st botolph aldersgate an unintended consequence and legacy of king henry viii s religious reforms
smithfield and its market situated mostly in the parish of st sepulchre was founded in and was endowed by prior rahere who also founded st barts
the ancient parish of st sepulchre extended north to turnmill street to st paul s cathedral and ludgate hill in the south and along the east bank of the fleet now the route of farringdon street
st sepulchre s tower contains the twelve bells of old bailey referred to in the nursery rhyme oranges and lemons
traditionally the great bell was rung to announce the execution of a prisoner at newgate
as a large open space close to the city smithfield was a popular place for public gatherings
in edward iii held a seven day tournament at smithfield for the amusement of his beloved alice perrers
possibly the most famous medieval tournament at smithfield was that commanded in by richard ii
jean froissart in his fourth book of chronicles reported that sixty knights would come to london to tilt for two days accompanied by sixty noble ladies richly ornamented and dressed
the tournament was proclaimed by heralds throughout england scotland hainault germany flanders and france so as to rival the jousts given by charles of france at paris a few years earlier upon the arrival of his consort isabel of bavaria
geoffrey chaucer supervised preparations for the tournament as a clerk to the king
along with tyburn smithfield was for centuries the main site for the public execution of heretics and dissidents in london
the scottish nobleman sir william wallace was executed in at west smithfield
the market was the meeting place prior to the peasants revolt and where the revolt s leader wat tyler was slain by sir william walworth lord mayor of london on june
religious dissenters catholics as well as other protestant denominations such as anabaptists were sentenced to death in this area during the crown s changing course of religious orientation started by king henry viii
about fifty protestants and religious reformers known as the marian martyrs were executed at smithfield during the reign of mary i
chesterton observed ironically
on november several protestant heretics were saved by a royal herald s timely announcement that queen mary had died shortly before the wooden faggots were to be lit at the smithfield stake
under english law death warrants were commanded by sign manual the personal signature of the monarch invariably upon ministerial recommendation which if unexercised by the time of a sovereign s death required renewed authority
in this case queen elizabeth did not approve the executions thus freeing the protestants
during the th century the smithfield site was also the place of execution of swindlers and coin forgers who were boiled to death in oil
by the th century the tyburn tree near the present day marble arch became the main place for public executions in london
after executions were again moved this time to the gates of newgate prison just to the south of smithfield
the smithfield area emerged largely unscathed by the great fire of london in which was abated near the fortune of war tavern at the junction of giltspur street and cock lane where the statue of the golden boy of pye corner is located
in the late th century several residents of smithfield emigrated to north america where they founded the town of smithfield rhode island
until the th century the area included boundary markers known as the west smithfield bars or more simply smithfield bars
these marked the northern boundary of the city of london and were placed at a point approximating to where modern charterhouse street meets st john street which was historically the first stretch of the great north road
the bars were on the route of the former fagswell brook a tributary of the fleet which marked the city s northern boundary in the area
the bars are first documented in and and were a site of public executions
since the late s smithfield and neighbouring farringdon have developed a reputation for being a cultural hub for up and coming professionals who enjoy its bars restaurants and night clubs
nightclubs such as fabric and turnmills pioneered the area s reputation for trendy night life attracting professionals from nearby holborn clerkenwell and the city on weekdays
at weekends the clubs and bars in the area having late licences draw people into the area from outside london too
smithfield has also become a venue for sporting events
until smithfield hosted the midnight start of the annual miglia quadrato car rally but with the increased night club activity around smithfield the uhulmc a motoring club decided to move the event s start to finsbury circus
since smithfield has been the chosen site of an annual event dedicated to road bicycle racing known as the smithfield nocturne

meat has been traded at smithfield market for more than years making it one of the oldest markets in london
a livestock market occupied the site as early as the th century
in the site was described by william fitzstephen as
a smooth field where every friday there is a celebrated rendezvous of fine horses to be traded and in another quarter are placed vendibles of the peasant swine with their deep flanks and cows and oxen of immense bulk costs customs and rules were meticulously laid down
for instance for an ox a cow or a dozen sheep one could get penny
the livestock market expanded over the centuries to meet demand from the growing population of the city
in the market was surrounded by a wooden fence containing the livestock within the market
until the market s abolition the gate house at cloth fair fair gate employed a chain le cheyne on market days
daniel defoe referred to the livestock market in as being without question the greatest in the world and data available appear to corroborate his statement
between and the average yearly sales at smithfield were reported to be around cattle and sheep
by the middle of the th century in the course of a single year head of cattle and sheep would be violently forced into an area of five acres in the very heart of london through its narrowest and most crowded thoroughfares
the volume of cattle driven daily to smithfield started to raise major concerns
the great north road traditionally began at smithfield market with st john street and islington high street forming the initial stages
mileages were taken from hicks hall a short distance up st john street some metres north of the west smithfield bars
the site of the hall continued to be used for mileages even after it was demolished soon after
the road followed st john street and continued north eventually leading to edinburgh
this ended in with the establishment of the general post office at st martin s le grand which became the new starting point with route following goswell road before joining islington high street and the re joining the historic route
in the victorian period pamphlets started circulating in favour of the removal of the livestock market and its relocation outside of the city due to its extremely poor hygienic conditions as well as the brutal treatment of the cattle
the conditions at the market in the first half of the th century were often described as a major threat to public health
of all the horrid abominations with which london has been cursed there is not one that can come up to that disgusting place west smithfield market for cruelty filth effluvia pestilence impiety horrid language danger disgusting and shuddering sights and every obnoxious item that can be imagined and this abomination is suffered to continue year after year from generation to generation in the very heart of the most christian and most polished city in the world in the farmer s magazine published a petition signed by bankers salesmen butchers aldermen and city residents against further expansion of the meat market arguing that livestock markets had been systematically banned since the middle ages in other areas of london
our ancestors appear in sanitary matters to have been wiser than we are
there exists amongst the rolls of parliament of the year a petition from the citizens of london praying that for the sake of the public health meat should not be slaughtered nearer than knyghtsbrigg under penalty not only of forfeiting such animals as might be killed in the butcherie but of a year s imprisonment
the prayer of this petition was granted audits penalties were enforced during several reigns thomas hood wrote in an ode to the advocates for the removal of smithfield market applauding those philanthropic men who aim at removing to a distance the vile zoology of the market and routing that great nest of hornithology
charles dickens criticised locating a livestock market in the heart of the capital in his essay a monument of french folly drawing comparisons with the french market at poissy outside paris
of a great institution like smithfield the french are unable to form the least conception
a beast market in the heart of paris would be regarded an impossible nuisance
nor have they any notion of slaughter houses in the midst of a city
one of these benighted frog eaters would scarcely understand your meaning if you told him of the existence of such a british bulwark an act of parliament was passed in under the provisions of which a new cattle market should be constructed at copenhagen fields islington
the metropolitan cattle market opened in leaving west smithfield as waste ground for about ten years during the construction of the new market
the present smithfield meat market on charterhouse street was established by act of parliament the metropolitan meat and poultry market act

at the corners of the market four octagonal pavilion towers were built each with a dome displaying carved stone griffins
as the market was being built a cut and cover railway tunnel was constructed below street level to create a triangular junction with the railway between blackfriars and kings cross through snow hill tunnel
closed in it has been revived and is now used for thameslink rail services
the construction of extensive railway sidings beneath smithfield park facilitated the transfer of animal carcasses to its cold store and directly up to the meat market via lifts
these sidings closed in the s
they are now used as a car park accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of smithfield park
today much of the meat is delivered to market by road

the red house with its imposing red brick and portland stone fa ade was built between and for the london central markets cold storage co
it was one of the first cold stores to be built outside the london docks and continued to serve smithfield market until the mid s
during the second world war a large underground cold store at smithfield was the theatre of secret experiments led by dr max perutz on pykrete a mixture of ice and woodpulp believed to be possibly tougher than steel
perutz s work inspired by geoffrey pyke and part of project habakkuk was meant to test the viability of pykrete as a material to construct floating airstrips in the atlantic to allow refuelling of cargo planes in support of admiral the earl mountbatten s operations
the experiments were carried out by perutz and his colleagues in a refrigerated meat locker in a smithfield market butcher s basement behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses
these experiments became obsolete with the development of longer range aircraft resulting in abandonment of the project
at the end of the second world war a v rocket struck the north side of charterhouse street near the junction with farringdon road
the explosion caused massive damage to the market buildings affecting the railway tunnel structure below and causing more than deaths
on january a fire broke out in the basement of union cold storage co at the smithfield poultry market
the fire spread throughout the maze of basements under the market and burned for three days
over fire fighters with fire engines were required to bring the blaze under control
two fire fighters were killed and were injured or treated for smoke inhalation
the market was largely destroyed and large portions not directly affected by fire collapsed as basements caved in
the introduction of breathing apparatus by the london fire brigade was a direct result of the fire
a red plaque commemorating the two fire fighters who died was unveiled at the market on the th anniversary of the fire
a replacement building was designed by sir thomas bennett in with a reinforced concrete frame and external cladding of dark blue brick
it is grade ii listed
the main hall is covered by an enormous concrete dome shaped as an elliptical paraboloid spanning feet m by feet m and only inches cm thick at the centre
the dome is believed to have been the largest concrete shell structure built at that time in europe
