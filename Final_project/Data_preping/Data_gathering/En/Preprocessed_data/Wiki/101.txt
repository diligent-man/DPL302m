st mary axe previously known as the swiss re building and informally known as the gherkin is a commercial skyscraper in london s primary financial district the city of london
it was completed in december and opened in april
with floors it is metres ft tall and stands on the sites of the former baltic exchange and chamber of shipping which were extensively damaged in in the baltic exchange bombing by a device placed by the provisional ira in st mary axe a narrow street leading north from leadenhall street
after plans to build the storey millennium tower were dropped st mary axe was designed by norman foster and the arup group
it was erected by skanska construction started in
the building has become a recognisable landmark of london and it is one of the city s most widely recognised examples of contemporary architecture
it won the emporis skyscraper award
the building stands on the site of the former baltic exchange st mary axe which was the headquarters of a global marketplace for shipping freight contracts and soft commodities and the chamber of shipping st mary axe
the tower s topmost panoramic dome known as the lens recalls the iconic glass dome that covered part of the ground floor of the baltic exchange and much of which is now displayed at the national maritime museum
the gherkin nickname was applied to the current building at least as early referring to the plan s highly unorthodox layout and appearance
on april the provisional ira detonated a bomb close to the baltic exchange causing extensive damage to the historic building and neighbouring structures
the united kingdom government s statutory adviser on the historic environment english heritage and the city of london s governing body the city of london corporation were keen that any redevelopment must restore the baltic exchange s old fa ade onto st mary axe
the exchange hall was a celebrated fixture of the shipping market
english heritage then discovered that the damage was far more severe than initially thought and they stopped insisting on full restoration albeit over the objections of architectural conservationists
the baltic exchange and the chamber of shipping sold the land to trafalgar house in
most of the remaining structures on the baltic exchange site were then carefully dismantled and the interior of exchange hall and the fa ade were preserved hoping for a reconstruction of the building in the future
the salvaged material was eventually sold for and moved to tallinn estonia where it awaits reconstruction as the centrepiece of the city s commercial sector
in trafalgar house submitted plans for the london millennium tower a metre ft building with more than m sq ft of office space apartments shops restaurants and gardens
this plan was dropped after objections that it was totally out of scale in the city of london and anticipated disruption to flight paths for both london city and london heathrow airports the revised plan for a lower tower was accepted
john prescott the deputy prime minister granted planning permission on august to construct a building on the site which would be much larger than the old exchange
the site needed development was not on any of the sight lines planning guidance requires that new buildings do not obstruct or detract from the view of st paul s cathedral dome when viewed from a number of locations around london and had housed the baltic exchange
the plan for the site was to reconstruct the baltic exchange
gmw architects proposed a new rectangular building surrounding a restored exchange it would have the type of large floor plan that banks liked
eventually the planners realised that the exchange was not recoverable forcing them to relax their building constraints they hinted that an architecturally significant building might obtain a favourable reception from city authorities
this gave the architect a free hand in the design
the building was designed according to the client s needs rather than for the needs of a large capital efficient money making building
the new building s low level plan satisfied the planning authority s desire to maintain london s traditional streetscape with its narrow streets
the massing of the tower was not too imposing
like barclays former city headquarters in lombard street the idea was that the passer by in neighbouring streets would be nearly oblivious to the tower s existence until directly underneath it
the building was constructed by skanska completed in december and opened on april
the primary occupant of the building is swiss re a global reinsurance company which had the building commissioned as the head office for its uk operation
the tower is thus sometimes known as the swiss re building although this name has never been official and was never in popular usage anyway unlike the gherkin moniker
the building uses energy saving methods which allow it to use only half the power that a similar tower would typically consume
gaps in each floor create six shafts that serve as a natural ventilation system for the entire building even though required firebreaks on every sixth floor interrupt the chimney
the shafts create a giant double glazing effect air is sandwiched between two layers of glazing and insulates the office space inside
architects promote double glazing in residential houses which avoids the inefficient convection of heat across the relatively narrow gap between the panes but the tower exploits this effect
the shafts pull warm air out of the building during the summer and warm the building in the winter using passive solar heating
the shafts also allow sunlight to pass through the building making the work environment more pleasing and keeping the lighting costs down
the primary methods for controlling wind excited sways are to increase the stiffness or increase damping with tuned active mass dampers
to a design by arup its fully triangulated perimeter structure makes the building rigid enough without any extra reinforcements
despite its overall curved glass shape there is only one piece of curved glass on the building the lens shaped cap at the apex
on the building s top level the th floor there is a bar for tenants and their guests with a panoramic view of london
a restaurant operates on the th floor and private dining rooms on the th
most buildings have extensive lift equipment on the roof of the building but this was not possible for the gherkin since a bar had been planned for the th floor
the architects dealt with this by having the main lift only reach the th floor with a separate push from below lift to the th floor
there is a marble stairwell and a disabled persons lift which leads the visitor up to the bar in the dome
the building is visible over long distances from the north for instance it can be seen from the m motorway some kilometres mi away while to the west it can be seen from the statue of george iii in windsor great park
in april a glass panel two thirds up the tower fell to the plaza beneath
the plaza was sealed off but the building remained open
a temporary covered walkway extending across the plaza to the building s reception was erected to protect visitors
engineers examined the other glass panels on the building
the cost of repair was covered by main contractor skanska and curtain wall supplier schmidlin now called schmidlin tsk ag
the open floor ventilation system did not operate as designed due to tenants adding glass partitions to increase security
since its completion the building has won a number of awards for architecture
in october the architect was awarded the stirling prize
for the first time in the prize s history the judges were unanimous
in december a survey of the world s largest firms of architects published in bd world architecture voted the tower as the most admired new building in the world
however ken shuttleworth who worked for foster partners on the design of the building said in that he believed the style was now out moded i was looking at the glass all around and thought why on earth did we do that now we would do things differently
the building appeared in recent films such as harry potter and the half blood prince a good year basic instinct and match point and rechristened the spirit of london became the spaceship centrepiece of keith mansfield s novel johnny mackintosh and the spirit of london
in september the building was put up for sale with a price tag of million
potential buyers included british land land securities prudential ing and the abu dhabi royal family
on february ivg immobilien ag and uk investment firm evans randall completed their joint purchase of the building for million making it britain s most expensive office building
swiss re made a gain of more than million from the sale
the new owners are seeking compensation from four of their former managers on the deal in which about million was paid for a building with a build cost of about million giving the previous owners a clear million profit
since february sky news has broadcast its flagship business programme jeff randall live from a studio in the building
the top two floors of the tower have been available since at least for private hire for events
deloitte announced in april that the building was again being put up for sale with an expected price of million
the current owners could not afford to make loan repayments citing differences in the value of the multi currency loan and the british pound high interest rates and general financing structure
in november the gherkin was purchased for million by the safra group controlled by the brazilian billionaire joseph safra
