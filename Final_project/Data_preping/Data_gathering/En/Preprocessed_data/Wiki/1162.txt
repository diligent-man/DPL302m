when eloise does not find any packages from her mother she then leaves the room in a large mess
she skips towards the lobby and pushes into a long line at the check in desk and interrupts a conversation between mr
salamone and two patrons wishing to upgrade their current hotel suite to a park side view room
eloise asks mr
salamone if there have been any packages from her mother in paris and he replies that there hasn t
he pushes her away telling eloise that he is currently very busy
eloise pushes in the line again offering mr
salamone some unnecessary assistance
salamone declines pushing eloise away from the hectic line again
eloise leaves but is instantly back in a flash when she notices a suspicious man waiting in the queue
she thinks that this patron is a spy but mr
salamone declines and instantly changes the subject so that eloise can leave the line
he requests eloise to look out for the hotel s christmas tree delivery which is due to be at the plaza any moment
he tells eloise to inform him when the delivery arrives
eloise leaves the line and tells the spy that she is keeping her eye on him
during her morning round a round eloise makes every morning where she says hello to everyone important in the hotel she meets brooks oliver iii a very nice man who is planning a party at the plaza

thornton a mean old lady and her dog mona
as eloise s turtle skipperdy often gets into trouble with mona and has recently snapped at her mrs
thornton threatens eloise that she will have the chef turn skipperdy into turtle soup if he doesn t stay away from mona
in her penthouse she wakes up nanny her very rationally thought caretaker
she orders room service which is brought to her by bill a room service waiter and her best friend who she acts out a skit with
after the skit he asks her if she ll help him set up for a party later in the hotel terrace room at which she accepts
over breakfast eloise tells nanny that the following day she would like to go christmas shopping as she would like to do it today but she has to go see mr
peabody the owner of the plaza about mrs
thornton s threat
nanny warns her not to as he dislikes eloise but she goes anyway
after pulling a prank to distract cornelia his secretary who also dislikes eloise eloise tells mr
peabody about mrs
thornton but he dismisses her concerns as he says he s expecting someone any moment and she should be worried about mrs
thornton instead as she won t be with them much longer
eloise starts to question him about it but he declines to answer saying he s already said enough
rachel peabody than arrives who is revealed to be his daughter
although mr
peabody and rachel are father and daughter they act like they hardly know each other for some unknown reason
peabody asks rachel when he gets to meet her fianc brooks than appears revealing he is her fianc and the party he is planning at the plaza is his wedding much to eloise s dismay
eloise and rachel meet who immediately like each other but eloise becomes suspicious of brooks
that afternoon as eloise and bill are setting up for a party in the terrace room rachel and brooks arrive with prunella arranging the wedding
after bill drops a tray in shock of seeing rachel it is revealed that rachel and bill dated a long time ago
bill meets brooks and is seen to be sad that he is her fianc
that night as eloise chats with the night maid lily she learns that rachel has been at a university in europe for the past four years as when mr
peabody found out that she and bill were romantically interested in each other he sent her far away hoping to break the ties with bill as he wanted something better for her than marrying a waiter
when the two pass by mrs
thornton s room without giving her any nightly services eloise asks why and learns that there has been a permanent stop to all services for her and eloise concludes that when mr
peabody said she wouldn t be with them much longer he meant she was going to die
later that night as mr
peabody and rachel are catching up he tells her that sending her away was the hardest thing he ever did but it was the right thing to do
he also tells her brooks is a good man and he s all he ever wanted for her
the next day eloise and nanny spend the day christmas shopping with eloise buying a total of presents and nanny buying none
returning to the hotel eloise sees mrs
thornton as she is getting onto the elevator and faints
she awakens in her bedroom and informs nanny that she saw the ghost of mrs
thornton who she believes has come back to haunt her
nanny tells her that she misunderstood the situation and that mrs
thornton isn t going to die she s just being evicted and will be moving out the day after christmas
taking pity on her eloise goes to her room to give her fresh towels and soap where she tells her the story of her son edgar
edgar moved to bavaria and married into the royal family as he was now extremely wealthy he paid to have her live at the plaza
however a year ago a telegram came informing her that edgar had died and there was no one left to take care of her as the bavarian government stole all his money
deciding to take matters into her own hands eloise plots to save mrs
thornton from eviction
the next day eloise confronts mr
peabody with the information but he tells her he already knows about her son and tells her what really happened to him he squandered most of his fortune and then ran off to live in bavaria to start a new life
to stop his mother from worrying he wrote to her and said he had married into royalty and would always support her in high style
he sent her most of his money to cover up his lie and when he died without a cent to his name she made up the delusion that the government had taken claim to his fortune leading eloise to realize edgar was never a prince
she then asks mr
peabody if he believes in true love who responds by asking her to expand on the question
she than points at a picture of rachel smiling very happily and says some people think a smile like that only comes around when you re truly in love
peabody tells eloise he thinks it s a matter of opinion and eloise agrees but also points out that rachel smiles differently now and asks him what he thinks to which he says nothing
bill and rachel become increasingly distant toward each other while tensions rise between eloise and brooks as she grows increasingly suspicious of brooks
since bill refuses to talk about he and rachel s past eloise decides to go and find out why brooks is seemingly so suspicious
while brooks is in the dining hall one day at lunch eloise spies on him from underneath a desert tray and discovers that brooks is a criminal as he has borrowed money from all across the country to make it look like he has his own fortune
as he now owes tons of money he is unable to pay back he plans to marry into a wealthy family steal their money and use it to pay off his debts
eloise tries to warn mr
peabody but cornelia refuses to let her see him
eloise also tries to get nanny to help her but nanny refuses saying that eloise s strong dislike of brooks probably caused her to misunderstand the situation and makes her pink promise to not say anything to anyone about it ever again
eloise decides to meddle in brooks and rachel s relationship by breaking them up and getting rachel back with bill
she sends rachel red roses with a card that says from your secret admirer and then convinces her later at her wedding dress fitting that it was bill who sent them
she learns from rachel that she and bill used to put on little shows at the plaza before she moved to europe
learning that rachel and brooks have a meeting with prunella at in the terrace room eloise tricks brooks into thinking the meeting has been cancelled and tricks prunella into thinking the meeting is at by covertly switching her planner

when rachel arrives eloise says she has to run and get something and that she should stay and sing with bill like they used to
rachel and bill sing wherever we go whatever we do and excitedly dance to it as well
prunella arrives and stops the two and says to bill he should remember his place as a waiter at the plaza
rachel defends him on account of how prunella missed their whole meeting and chastises her for it as eloise watches in pleasure
during her morning round the next morning eloise notices rachel brooks and her father having breakfast in the dining hall and spies on them from behind a newspaper
while eloise is pretending to read the newspaper she sees an article that says there is a performance of gypsy the musical tonight and gets tickets for rachel and bill to go telling bill they re a christmas gift from her to him

eloise than runs to rachel s room hoping to convince her to stop the wedding as her last hope
while banging on the door for rachel to open up eloise yells that rachel can t marry brooks because there are things about him that she doesn t know
but it is brooks who answers the door much to eloise s horror
