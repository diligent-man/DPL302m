the history of creationism relates to the history of thought based on the premise that the natural universe had a beginning and came into being supernaturally
the term creationism in its broad sense covers a wide range of views and interpretations and was not in common use before the late th century
throughout recorded history many people have viewed the universe as a created entity
many ancient historical accounts from around the world refer to or imply a creation of the earth and universe
although specific historical understandings of creationism have used varying degrees of empirical spiritual and or philosophical investigations they are all based on the view that the universe was created
the genesis creation narrative has provided a basic framework for jewish and christian epistemological understandings of how the universe came into being through the divine intervention of the god yahweh
historically literal interpretations of this narrative were more dominant than allegorical ones
from the th century on various views aimed at reconciling the abrahamic religions and genesis with geology biology and other sciences developed in western culture
at this time the word creationism referred to a doctrine of creation of the soul
those holding that species had been created in a separate act such as philip gosse in were generally called advocates of creation though they were also called creationists in private correspondence between charles darwin and his friends dating from
in the th century the word creationism became associated with the anti evolution movement of the s and young earth creationism but this usage was contested by other groups such as old earth creationists and evolutionary creationists who hold different concepts of creation such as the acceptance of the age of the earth and biological evolution as understood by the scientific community
the genesis flood became the most successful young earth creationist publication after
from the mid s creationists in the united states promoted the teaching of scientific creationism using flood geology in public school science classes
after the legal judgment of the case daniel v
waters ruled that teaching creationism in public schools contravened the establishment clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution the content was stripped of overt biblical references and renamed creation science
when the court case edwards v
aguillard ruled that creation science similarly contravened the constitution all references to creation in a draft school textbook were changed to refer to intelligent design which was presented by creationists as a new scientific theory
the kitzmiller v
dover ruling concluded that intelligent design is not science and contravenes the constitutional restriction on teaching religion in public school science classes
in september bill nye the science guy expressed his concern that creationist views threaten science education and innovations in the united states
in the th and th centuries discoveries in new lands brought knowledge of the diversity of life
in francis bacon emphasized that the works of god in nature teach us how to interpret the bible and the baconian method introduced the empirical approach which became central to modern science
natural theology sought evidence in nature supporting an active role of god and attempts were made to reconcile new knowledge with the biblical deluge myth and story of noah s ark
the development of modern geology in the th and th centuries found geological strata and fossil sequences indicating a very ancient earth
the diluvial cosmogonies fell victim to their own success as the spirit of scientific inquiry they had stimulated gradually led to discoveries that undercut the biblical premises of flood geology and catastrophism
from around the start of the th century ideas such as jean baptiste lamarck s concept of transmutation of species had gained supporters in paris and edinburgh mostly amongst anatomists
the anonymous publication of vestiges of the natural history of creation in aroused wide public interest with support from quakers and unitarians but was strongly criticised by the religious establishment and the scientific community which called for solidly backed science
in charles darwin s on the origin of species provided that evidence from an authoritative and respected source and within a decade or so convinced scientists that evolution occurs
this view clashed with that of conservative evangelicals in the church of england but in their attention turned to the much greater uproar about essays and reviews by liberal anglican theologians which introduced higher criticism a hermeneutic method re examining the bible and questioning literal readings
by most american naturalists supported ideas of theistic evolution often involving special creation of human beings
at this time those holding that species had been separately created were generally called advocates of creation but they were occasionally called creationists in private correspondence between charles darwin and his friends
the term appears in letters darwin wrote between and and was also used in a response by charles lyell
by this time geologists recognised that the earth was millions of years old
the exact chronology proposed by darwin was disputed by other geologists and the leading physicist william thomson later ennobled as lord kelvin produced an analyses of the heat energy and thermal histories of the earth and sun which yielded age estimates that were too short for gradual evolution
thomson s colleague fleeming jenkin wrote an review of darwin s on the origin of species which opposed evolution on the basis of the shortened time available
kelvin s age paradox was not resolved until it was discovered in the th century that the earth is heated by radioactive decay that its internal thermal gradient is affected by mantle convection and that the sun is heated by nuclear fusion
since the s the big bang theory has been the prevailing cosmological model for the universe
it was envisioned by a roman catholic priest monsignor georges lema tre in the s
lema tre suggested that the evident expansion of the universe if projected back in time meant that at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point a primeval atom where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence
however in the s and s almost every major cosmologist subscribed to a view that the universe is in an eternal steady state
after lema tre proposed his theory some scientists complained that its assumption that time had a beginning amounted to a reimportation of religious concepts into physics
when the expression big bang was coined by fred hoyle in he meant it to be slightly pejorative but the term stuck and gained currency
lema tre himself concluded that an initial creation like event must have occurred
the big bang is contrary to young earth creationism sensu stricto
but it has been welcomed by other christian creeds and it is in line with the roman catholic concept of creation
under the anthropic principle by which the properties of the universe is seemingly fine tuned for our own existence some christians see evidence that a divine creator has purposefully designed the universe
david sedley in his book creationism and its critics in antiquity traces creationist thought to the presocratic thinkers anaxagoras and empedocles in the th century bce
sedley states that anaxagoras was recognized by plato as the first overt champion of a creative cosmic intelligence
anaxagoras s theory was that the original state of the world was a roughly even mixture of all opposites and that it was the effect of the action of nous intelligence or mind that led to the partial separation of such opposites hot from cold land from water rarefied from dense
anaxagoras also developed the philosophical innovation of dualism of mind from matter diverging from the stringent monism of his predecessor parmenides
empedocles proposed a system whereby two competing divine forces love harmony and blending and strife separation had alternating dominion over the universe and the four elements earth water air and fire
around bce cicero made a teleological argument that anticipated the watchmaker analogy in de natura deorum ii
when you see a sundial or a water clock you see that it tells the time by design and not by chance
how then can you imagine that the universe as a whole is devoid of purpose and intelligence when it embraces everything including these artifacts themselves and their artificers gjertsen p
quoted by dennett p
galen stoic roman physician wrote against creation beliefs in on the usefulness of the parts of the body
it is precisely this point in which our own opinion and that of plato and of the other greeks who follow the right method in natural science differ from the position taken up by moses
for the latter it seems enough to say that god simply willed the arrangement of matter and it was presently arranged in due order for he believes everything to be possible with god even should he wish to make a bull or a horse out of ashes
we however do not hold this we say that certain things are impossible by nature and that god does not even attempt such things at all but that he sic chooses the best out of the possibility of becoming in the th century saint augustine wrote the literal meaning of genesis in which he argued that genesis should be interpreted as god forming the earth and life from pre existing matter and allowed for an allegorical interpretation of the first chapter of genesis
for example he argues that the six day structure of creation presented in the book of genesis represents a logical framework rather than the passage of time in a physical way
on the other hand augustine called for a historical view of the remainder of the history recorded in genesis including the creation of adam and eve and the flood
apart from his specific views augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult and remarks that christians should be willing to change their minds about it as new information comes up
he also warned believers not to rashly interpret things literally that might be allegorical as it would discredit the faith
muhammad reports receiving the qur an by divine revelation
the qur an holds many of the core concepts of creationism including a day creation adam and eve enoch and noah s ark but also provides some details absent from genesis including reference to a fourth son of noah who chose not to enter the ark
through islam creation beliefs and monotheism replace paganism among the arabs
the renaissance starting in the th century saw the establishment of protoscience that eventually became modern science
this was a period of great social change
the protestant reformation introduced lay people reading the bible in translation and more literal understandings and led to a new belief that every biological species had been individually created by god
the baconian method introduced the empirical scientific method
natural theology sought evidence in nature supporting christianity
nicolaus copernicus s idea of heliocentrism was proposed in the th century and established by galileo galilei johannes kepler and newton
this overturned the greek ptolemaic system of geocentrism which had been adopted as church dogma with the fusion of christianity with greek philosophy in the first few centuries ce
the english naturalist john ray is sometimes referred to as the father of english natural history
as well as collecting and classifying plants he wrote two books entitled the wisdom of god manifested in the works of the creation and miscellaneous discourses concerning the dissolution and changes of the world which included essays on the primitive chaos and creation of the world the general deluge its causes and effects and the dissolution of the world and future conflagrations
in the wisdom of god he included many of the familiar examples of purposive adaptation and design in nature the teleological argument such as the structure of the eye the hollowness of the bones the camel s stomach and the hedgehog s armor
in april descartes wrote three letters to the father mersenne which exposed for the first time his creation doctrine
descartes affirmed god creates the eternal truths and the material and extended world with a uninterrupted free and voluntaristic work
this conception was subsequently developed in the fifth and sixth replies to the objections to his meditations
descartes was influenced by the francisco suarez s view on primitivism and divine realism for which the connections between properties of the real world e g
being a man and being an animal belong immutably to the essence and intellect of god the creator from ever and forever and therefore aren t created by him
carl linnaeus in the th century established a system of classification of species by similarity
at the time the system of classification was seen as the plan of organization used by god in his creation
later the theory of evolution applied it as groundwork for the idea of common descent
in the church of ireland archbishop of armagh james ussher published a monumental history of the world from creation to a d
he used the recorded genealogies and ages in the bible to derive what is commonly known as the ussher chronology
this calculated a date for creation at bce
the date was widely accepted in the english speaking world
in william whiston published a new theory of the earth in which he proposed an account of the creation of the world
he grounded his argument in the following three postulata
the obvious or literal sense of scripture is the true and real one where no evidence can be given to the contrary
that which is clearly accountable in a natural way is not without reason to be ascribed to a miraculous power
what ancient tradition asserts of the constitution of nature or of the origin and primitive states of the world is to be allowed for true where tis fully agreeable to scripture reason and philosophy whiston was the first to propose that the global flood was caused by the water in the tail of a comet
the english divine william derham published his artificial clockmaker in and physico theology in
these books were teleological arguments for the being and attributes of god and were used by paley nearly a century later
the watchmaker analogy was put by bernard nieuwentyt and referred to several times by paley
a charge of wholesale plagiarism from this book was brought against paley in the athenaeum for but the famous illustration of the watch was not peculiar to nieuwentyt and had been appropriated by many others before paley
david hume a scottish naturalist empiricist and skeptic argued for naturalism and against belief in god
he argued that order stems from both design and natural processes so it is not necessary to infer a designer when one sees order that the design argument even if it worked would not support a robust or even moral god that the argument begged the question of the origin of god and that design was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature
james hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist
in he presented a paper entitled theory of the earth to the royal society of edinburgh
based upon a detailed examination of what we now recognise as the lithosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere he showed that the present forces seen on the earth were sufficient to explain all the phenomena observed
he wrote the mosaic history places this beginning of man at no great distance and there has not been found in natural history any document by which a high antiquity can be attributed to the human race
but this is not the case with regard to the inferior species of animals particularly those which inhabit the ocean and its shorees
we find in natural history monuments which prove that those animals had long existed and thus we thus preocure a measure for the computation of time extremely remote though far from being precisely ascertained p based upon these principles of uniformitarianism he demonstrated that the earth is much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediment to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea which in turn were raised up to become dry land
the presumption that the world was only years old was scientifically abandoned as a result of hutton s work
this development of the scientific discipline of geology in the late th and early th centuries and the discovery that the earth was far older than a literal interpretation of the book of genesis could account for led to the development and popularity of the gap theory now known as gap creationism to accommodate these discoveries
gap theory assumes a recent six day creation but also that the earth existed for many ages before this event ending in cataclysm and a new creation hence its alternative title ruin restoration theory
in the early th century a heterogeneous group of writers known as scriptural geologists arose to oppose these discoveries and the gap theory
their views were marginalised and ignored by the scientific community of their time
they had much the same relationship to philosophical or scientific geologists as their indirect descendants the twentieth century creationists paul wood describes them as mostly anglican evangelicals with no institutional focus and little sense of commonality they generally lacked any background in geology and had little influence even in church circles
from to the geologist and clergyman sir charles lyell released a three volume publication called principles of geology which developed hutton s ideas of uniformitarianism and in the second volume set out a gradualist variation of creation beliefs in which each species had its centre of creation and was designed for the habitat but would become extinct when the habitat changed
john herschel supported this gradualist view and wrote to lyell urging a search for natural laws underlying the mystery of mysteries of how species formed
in philip henry gosse published omphalos untying the geological knot
the omphalos hypothesis argued that the world had been created by god recently but with the appearance of old age
this was largely ignored and some considered it blasphemous because it accused the creator of deceit
some young earth creationists would later incorporate parts of his arguments
erasmus darwin published his zo nomia between and foreshadowing lamarck s ideas on evolution and even suggesting that all warm blooded animals have arisen from one living filament which the great first cause endued with animality
possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity
advances in paleontology led by william smith saw the recording of the first fossil records that showed the transmutation of species
then jean baptiste lamarck proposed in his philosophie zoologique of a theory of evolution later known as lamarckism by which traits that were needed were passed on
in william paley published natural theology in response to naturalists such as hume refining the ancient teleological argument or argument from design to argue for the existence of god
he argued that life was so intricately designed and interconnected as to be analogous to a watch
just as when one finds a watch one reasonably infers that it was designed and constructed by an intelligent being although one has never seen the designer when one observes the complexity and intricacy of life one may reasonably infer that it was designed and constructed by god although one has never seen god
the official eight bridgewater treatises on the power wisdom and goodness of god as manifested in the creation included the reverend william buckland s geology and mineralogy considered with reference to natural theology setting out the logic of day age gap theory and theistic evolution
the computing pioneer charles babbage then published his unofficial ninth bridgewater treatise in putting forward a thesis that god had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator making laws or programs that then produced species at the appropriate times rather than continually interfering with ad hoc miracles each time a new species was required
by the anatomist richard owen had theories influenced by johannes peter m ller that living matter had an organising energy a life force that directed the growth of tissues and also determined the lifespan of the individual and of the species
in the s owen developed ideas of archetypes in the divine mind producing a sequence of species in ordained continuous becoming in which new species appeared at birth
late in the anonymous publication of vestiges of the natural history of creation popularised the idea of divinely ordered development of everything from stellar evolution to transmutation of species
it quickly gained fashionable success in court circles and aroused interest in all sections of society
it also aroused religious controversy and after initially being slow to respond the scientific establishment attacked the book
it continued to be a best seller to around the end of the century
herbert spencer was a th century english philosopher who developed ideas about the unifying concept of evolution across the natural and social sciences
spencer is the first to develop a theory of cultural evolution and is considered by some to be the father of social darwinism
it is also he and not darwin who coined the phrase survival of the fittest
much of the positivist ideas of progress that dominated the social science philosophy of spencer and subsequent social darwinists has been criticized by present day sociologists but such ideas continue to be one of the major critiques made by creationists against evolution in general even though strict biological evolution does not depend on it nor offer any type of endorsement of so called social darwinism or its derivative philosophies such as eugenics
the decades following charles darwin s publication of the origin of species in saw the overwhelming majority of north american and british naturalists accept some form of evolution with many liberal and educated churchmen following their example and thereby rejecting a biblically literalist interpretation of genesis
although darwin s work rejected the dogma of separate creations he invoked creation as the probable source of the first lifeforms into which life was first breathed
this led asa gray who was both religiously orthodox and darwin s most prominent american supporter to suggest that darwin had accepted a supernatural beginning of life on earth and that he should therefore allow a second special origination for humanity
darwin however rejected this view and used uncompromisingly naturalistic language in place of biblical idiom starting with the descent of man in
darwin s book caused less controversy than he had feared as the idea of evolution had been widely popularized in victorian britain by the publication of vestiges of creation
however it posed fundamental questions about the relationship between religion and science
though origin did not explicitly deal with human evolution the jump was one both supporters and opponents of the theory immediately made and the idea that man was simply an animal common descent who had evolved a particular set of characteristics rather than a spiritual being created by god continued to be one of the most divisive notions of the th century
one of the most famous disputes was the oxford debate of in which t h
huxley darwin s self appointed bulldog debated evolution with samuel wilberforce the bishop of oxford
both sides claimed victory then the controversy was overshadowed by the even greater theological furore over the publication of essays and reviews questioning whether miracles were atheistic bringing to a head arguments in the church of england between liberal theologians supporting higher criticism and conservative evangelicals
the essays were described by their opponents as heretical and the essayists were called the seven against christ
in the glaswegian physicist william thomson later lord kelvin published calculations based on his presumption of uniformitarianism and that the heat of the sun was caused by its gravitational shrinkage that fixed the age of the earth and the solar system at between million and million years i e
between and times ussher s value
this came as a blow to darwin s anticipated timescale though the idea of an ancient earth was generally accepted without much controversy
darwin and huxley while not accepting the timing said it merely implied faster evolution
it would take further advances in geology and the discovery of radioactivity that showed that the sun was in fact heated by nuclear fusion that demonstrated the present estimated billion years or times ussher s value
a way to measure the age of the universe would be discovered by edwin hubble in the s but due to observational constraints an accurate measurement of the hubble constant would not be forthcoming until the late s
according to the esa planck data released in march the age of the universe is approximately billion years or some times ussher s value
the swiss american paleontologist louis agassiz opposed evolution
he believed that there had been a series of catastrophes with divine re creations evidence of which could be seen in rock fossils
though uniformitarianism dominated ideas from the s onwards catastrophism remained a major paradigm in geology until replaced by new models that allowed for both cataclysms such as meteor strikes and gradualist patterns such as ice ages to explain observed geologic phenomena
in american presbyterians held the first annual niagara bible conference founding the christian fundamentalist movement which took its name from the five fundamentals of and came to be concerned about the implications of evolution for the accuracy of the bible
but by no means all orthodox presbyterians were opposed to evolution as a possible method of the divine procedure
dr charles hodge of princeton seminary objected in to the atheism he considered inplied in the naturalistic explanation but both he and dr b
warfield were open to its possibility probability within limits and most churchmen sought to reconcile darwinism with christianity
darwin died in
in elizabeth cotton lady hope spread rumors that he had repented and accepted god on his deathbed
lady hope s story is almost certainly false and it is unlikely that she visited darwin as she claimed
in the s the term creationism became particularly associated with a christian fundamentalist movement opposed to the idea of human evolution which succeeded in getting teaching of evolution banned in united states public schools
from the mid s young earth creationism proposed scientific creationism using flood geology as support for a literal reading of genesis
after legal judgements that teaching this in public schools contravened constitutional separation of church and state it was stripped of biblical references and called creation science then when this was ruled unacceptable intelligent design was coined
the decades before the start of the th century and the first decades of that century have been described as the eclipse of darwinism
darwin s work had quickly established scientific consensus that evolution occurred but there was considerable disagreement about the mechanisms involved and few gave as much significance to natural selection as darwin himself
evolution itself was assumed but the mechanism of how it happened was in considerable debate and none had anything near to a consensus
among these theories were neo lamarckism which merged certain aspects of lamarck s theory of acquired characteristics with certain aspects of darwinian evolution orthogenesis straight line evolution which talked about evolution towards a specific goal by forces within the organism and the discontinuous variation of mendelism and hugo de vries mutation theory
some of these alternative theories in particular neo lamarckism and orthogenesis allowed more easily for an interpretation of the intervention of god which appealed to many scientists at the time
the term darwinism had covered a wide range of ideas many of which differed from darwin s views but it became associated with the minority view of august weismann who went further than darwin by rejecting inheritance of acquired characters and attributing all evolution to natural selection a view also called neo darwinism
by the first decades of the th century the debate had become generally one between continuous variation biometricians and discontinuous variety mendelians
in the s and s though they were combined with natural selection into the modern evolutionary synthesis which soon became the dominant model in the scientific community
this model has also been called darwinism and neo darwinism
george mccready price was important in developing flood geology and while he had limited influence at a time when all geologists had long accepted an ancient earth many of his ideas that a young earth could be deduced from science were taken up later
price was a seventh day adventist and followed one of the founders of the church ellen white in seeing fossils as evidence of the great flood
in price published illogical geology the weakest point in the evolution theory in which he offered to any one who will in the face of the facts here presented show me how to prove that one kind of fossil is older than another
in the general assembly of the presbyterian church distilled the principles of christian fundamentalism into what were known as the five fundamentals one of which was the inerrancy of the scriptures including the genesis account of creation
the fundamentals were published as a series of essays
its authors accepted ancient earth geology while holding different ideas about how this was reconciled with biblical accounts
the views expressed on evolution were mixed two short articles were anti evolution one anonymous and one by the little known henry beach
their focus was on human evolution as were attacks made on evolution by dyson hague
major figures were explicitly open to the possibility that god created through a lamarckian form of evolution long articles by james orr and george frederick wright expressed this openness and benjamin breckinridge warfield and a h strong shared this view
after the first world war the teaching of creation and evolution in public education grew as a public controversy
by this time many texts taught the theory of evolution as scientific fact
many christians in the us and later jews and muslims expressed concern that in teaching evolution as fact the state was unconstitutionally infringing on their right to the free exercise of religion as in their opinion this taught their children that the bible had been proven false
for example the democratic party politician william jennings bryan became convinced that the teaching of evolution as a fact caused the students to lose faith in the bible first in the story of creation and later in other doctrines which underlie the christian religion
during the first world war reports of horrors committed by germans who were citizens of one of the most scientifically advanced countries in the world led bryan to state the same science that manufactured poisonous gases to suffocate soldiers is preaching that man has a brute ancestry and eliminating the miraculous and the supernatural from the bible
a popular book published in by stanford university professor and entomologist vernon l
kellogg entitled headquarters nights drew a direct association between german war ideology and darwinian description of nature as a struggle
kellogg was a leading authority on evolution of insects and had published darwinism today in
his anti darwinian and anti german rhetoric in headquarters nights influenced biologists who tried to play down the negative implications of survival of the fittest
benjamin kidd s book science of power claimed that there were historical and philosophical connections between darwinism and german militarism
this book and others around this time had an effect on many people
in william jennings bryan published in his image in which he argued that darwinism was both irrational and immoral
on the former point he pointed to examples such as the eye which he argued could not be explained by darwinian evolution
on the latter point he argued that darwinism advocated the policy of scientific breeding or eugenics by which the strong were to weed out the weak a policy that directly contradicts the christian doctrine of charity to the helpless
in fundamentalist preacher and evangelist william bell riley known as the grand old man of fundamentalism founded the anti evolution league of minnesota which in became the anti evolution league of america
the organization was behind anti evolution legislation in kentucky where its efforts were supported by william jennings bryan
in clarence darrow defended nathan leopold and richard loeb on the charge of kidnapping and killing bobby franks his defense included an argument that this terrible crime was inherent in his organism and it came from some ancestor
in the s and s harry rimmer was one of the most prominent american creationists
known as the noisiest evangelist in america he published many creationist tracts debated other creationists and was involved in a famous trial known as the floyd rimmer trial against the atheist william floyd
chesterton published the everlasting man in which he developed and articulated many creationist ideas and criticisms of the philosophical underpinnings and perceived logical flaws of evolution
the scopes trial of is perhaps the most famous court case of its kind
the butler act had prohibited the teaching of evolution in public schools in tennessee
clarence darrow was the defense counsel and william jennings bryan was the prosecutor
bryan appealed for assistance to george mccready price johns hopkins university physician howard a
kelly physicist louis t
more and alfred w
mccann all of whom had written books supporting creationism
price was away in england kelly and more told bryan they considered themselves more convinced by evolution and mccann was not interested because of bryan s stance on prohibition
nevertheless a schoolteacher named john t
scopes was found guilty of teaching evolution and fined although the case was later dismissed on a technicality
following up on the butler act antievolutionary laws were passed in mississippi in and then in arkansas in
however the election and the onset of the depression changed the playing field
creationists shifted their attention from state legislatures to local school boards having substantial success
they set themselves to the tasks of the emasculation of textbooks the purging of libraries and above all the continued hounding of teachers discussions of evolution vanished from almost all schoolbooks
by about one third of american teachers were afraid of being accused of supporting evolution
in a book by one of george mccready price s former students harold w
clark described price s catastrophism as creationism in back to creationism
previously anti evolutionists had described themselves as being christian fundamentalists anti evolution or anti false science the term creationism had previously referred to the creation of souls for each new person as opposed to traducianism where souls were said to have been inherited from one s parents
in a group of atheists seeking to develop a new religion to replace previous deity based religions composed the humanist manifesto which outlined a fifteen point belief system the first two points of which provided that religious humanists regard the universe as self existing and not created and humanism believes that man is a part of nature and that he has emerged as a result of a continuous process this document exacerbated the ideological tone of the discussion in many circles as many creationists came to see evolution as a doctrine of the religion of atheism
in the religion and science association was formed by a small group of creationists led by a wheaton college professor to form a unified front against the theory of evolution there were three main schools of creationist thought represented by price rimmer and tidal expert william bell dawson
however since dawson was a proponent of day age creationism and rimmer was ardently convinced that gap creationism was correct the staunch supporters of a literal day creation and year old earth were incensed and the organization fell apart
price and his supporters retreated to california and with several doctors working at the college of medical evangelists now loma linda university formed the deluge geology society the deluge geology society published the bulletin of deluge geology and related science from to
they made secret plans to unveil discoveries of fossils of human footprints that were in rock that was purportedly older than accounted for in evolutionary theory
however again the organization foundered over disagreements about a year old earth
price was particularly strident in his attacks against fellow creationists
his friend and former student harold w
clark had earned a master s degree in biology from the university of california berkeley and felt that price s book new geology was entirely out of date and inadequate unfortunately price responded angrily when he found out accusing clark of suffering from the modern mental disease of universityitis and of falling in with the tobacco smoking sabbath breaking
god defying evolutionists
clark pleaded with price that he still believed in a day creation and a young earth and a universal flood but price responded with a vitriolic publication entitled theories of satanic origin about clark and his views
the american george gaylord simpson argued that the paleontological record supported evolution in the s
some creationists however objected to his supposed equation of microevolution and macroevolution acknowledging the former but denying the latter and continue to do so to this day
the second world war saw the horrors of the nazi holocaust
american creationist explanation for the holocaust is that it had been driven in part by eugenics or the principle that individuals with undesirable genetic characteristics should be removed from the gene pool
eugenics was based in part on principles of cultural evolutionary theory though many biologists had long opposed it
although eugenics was rejected by other nations after the war the memory of it did not quickly fade and professional scientists sought to distance themselves from it and other racial ideologies associated with the nazis
fissures within the creationist community which had always been present continued to deepen as fundamentalists received advanced training in the sciences
geochemist j
laurence kulp had gone to the evangelical school wheaton college for his undergraduate degree and was a plymouth brother
he obtained a phd from princeton before taking a faculty position at columbia
he felt it was his duty to warn fellow christians in the evangelical scientific organization the american scientific affiliation asa of the problems with price s claims
kulp wrote a review of price s work in which he stated that major propositions of the theory are contradicted by established physical and chemical laws in
this caused substantial consternation among his fellow members of the american scientific affiliation asa an affiliation of christians who are also scientists causing many to claim that kulp had been contaminated with the orthodox geological viewpoint and this was responsible for his faith in the bible being badly shaken
kulp s influence however continues today within the american scientific affiliation which continues to support old earth creationism
in the s the united states slid into a cold war with the communist soviet union its former ally
communism had as one of its principles atheism
americans divided over the issues of communism and atheism but with the great purge cultural revolution and hungarian uprising many became concerned about the implications of communism and atheism
at the same time the scientific community was making great strides in developing the theory of evolution which seemed to make belief in god unreasonable under occam s razor
the american shock and panic about the sputnik launch led to the passage of the national defense education act in to reform american science curricula
this resulted in the biological sciences curriculum study also begun in and with the goal of writing new up to date biology textbooks
these new biology textbooks included a discussion of the theory of evolution
within a few years half of american schools were using the new bscs biology textbooks
in addition the hundredth anniversary of the publication of the origin of species was in and this sparked renewed public interest in evolutionary biology
the creationist fervor of the past seemed like ancient history
a historian at oklahoma s northeastern state university r
halliburton even made a prediction in that a renaissance of the creationist movement is most unlikely
in henry m
morris and john c
whitcomb jr published a book entitled the genesis flood in an effort to provide a scientific basis for young earth creationism and flood geology
morris had published several books previously but none had the impact that the genesis flood did
its publication resulted in ten like minded creationists forming the creation research society in and the institute for creation research in
in the us supreme court ruled in epperson vs
arkansas that a act forbidding the teaching of human evolution violated the establishment clause of the us constitution
this clause lays out the separation of church and state in the united states and states that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or restricting the free exercise thereof
in creationists in california established the institute for creation research to meet the need for an organization devoted to research publication and teaching in those fields of science particularly relevant to the study of origins
in a famous anti young earth creationist essay by the evolutionary biologist theodosius dobzhansky was published in the american biology teacher entitled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution
he argued that evolution was not incompatible with a belief in god nor a belief in the accuracy of scriptures
in in daniel v
waters the u s
sixth circuit of appeals struck down tennessee s equal time law that any biology textbook which discussed human origins must give equal emphasis to the biblical account
