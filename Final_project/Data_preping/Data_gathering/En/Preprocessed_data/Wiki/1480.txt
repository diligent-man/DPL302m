Dacia Ripensis lit 'riparian Dacia' was the name of a Roman province in the northern Balkan peninsula immediately south of the Middle Danube
Its capital was Ratiaria modern Archar Bulgaria
It was a district less urban than neighbouring Dacia Mediterranea and more militarized military camps and forts rather than cities were typical of the province
Besides Ratiaria Oescus was the major settlement
Dacia Ripensis was one of the Two Dacias established south of the Danube in the late rd century
The Roman emperor Aurelian r abandoned the province of Roman Dacia established by Trajan r in AD on the northern bank of the river and created the two new Dacias between the existing provinces of Moesia Prima upstream and Moesia Secunda downstream
The northern part of Aurelian's Dacia Aureliana is attested as Dacia Ripensis in
The southern part with its capital at Serdica modern Sofia was known as Dacia Mediterranea
According to the Laterculus Veronensis both provinces were part of the Diocese of Moesiae after the empire was divided into dioeceses during the reign of Constantine the Great r but by the time of the Notitia Dignitatum they were part of the Diocese of Thrace
According to the Notitia Dacia Ripensis was governed by a praeses while the governor of Dacia Mediterranea was a more senior consularis
Dacia Ripensis was under the authority of the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum
Dacia Ripensis flourished in the mid-th century and some forts on the northern bank of the Danube were recovered by the Romans
In the th century Priscus described Ratiaria as large and densely populated
In the th century Hierocles's Late Greek Synecdemus identifies Ratiera as the principal city of the province calling the province Δακία Παραποτάμια Daka Parapotmia 'Dacia-by-the-river' though Procopius referred to it as Ῥιπησία Rhipēsa
In emperor Justinian I - created the Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima as a regional primacy with ecclesiastical jurisdiction over all provinces of the Diocese of Dacia including the province of Dacia Ripensis
It is unclear whether Aurelian or the Emperor Diocletian replaced Dacia Aureliana with two provinces but by there were two Dacia Mediterranea with its capital at Serdica and Dacia Ripensis with its capital at Ratiaria
Later these two Dacias along with Dardania Lower Moesia and Prevalitana constituted the Diocese of Dacia
Ratiaria was established as the capital of Dacia Ripensis it was previously a colony founded by Trajan located within Moesia Superior and served both as the seat of the military governor or dux and as the military base for the Roman legion XIII Gemina
According to Priscus Dacia Ripensis was a flourishing province during the th and th centuries AD
During the early s however the Huns captured the province prior to this there were conflicts between the Romans and the Huns whereby the latter group captured Castra Martis through treacherous means
Even though the province recovered briefly from Hunnic rule it was eventually decimated by the Avars in
