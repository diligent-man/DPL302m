computer architecture memory hierarchy separate computer storage hierarchy based response time
since response time complexity capacity related level may also distinguished performance controlling technologies
memory hierarchy affect performance computer architectural design algorithm prediction lower level programming construct involving locality reference
designing high performance requires considering restriction memory hierarchy ie
various component viewed part hierarchy memory mn member mi typically smaller faster next highest member mi hierarchy
limit waiting higher level lower level respond filling buffer signaling activating transfer
off-line bulk storage tertiary off-line storagethis general memory hierarchy structuring
example paging algorithm may considered level virtual memory designing computer architecture one include level nearline storage online offline storage
cmox memory technology stretch flash space memory hierarchy
one main way increase system performance minimising far memory hierarchy one ha go manipulate data
location memory hierarchy dictate time required prefetch occurthe number level memory hierarchy performance level ha increased time
example memory hierarchy intel haswell mobile processor circa is
processor register fastest possible access usually cpu cycle
level l micro operation cache byte kib size
best access speed consumer solid state drive mbs
offline storagethe lower level hierarchy disk downwards also known tiered storage
nearline storage immediately available made online quickly without human intervention
offline storage immediately available requires human intervention bring onlinefor example always-on spinning disk online spinning disk spin-down massive array idle disk maid nearline
removable medium tape cartridge automatically loaded tape library nearline cartridge must manually loaded offline
modern cpu fast program workload bottleneck locality reference memory access efficiency caching memory transfer different level hierarchy
result cpu spends much time idling waiting memory io complete
sometimes called space cost larger memory object likely overflow smallfast level require use largerslower level
resulting load memory use known pressure respectively register pressure cache pressure main memory pressure
term data missing higher level needing fetched lower level respectively register spilling due register pressure register cache cache miss cache main memory hard page fault main memory disk
modern programming language mainly assume two level memory main memory disk storage though assembly language inline assembler language c register directly accessed
taking optimal advantage memory hierarchy requires cooperation programmer hardware compiler well underlying support operating system
programmer responsible moving data disk memory file io
optimizing compiler responsible generating code executed cause hardware use cache register efficientlymany programmer assume one level memory
