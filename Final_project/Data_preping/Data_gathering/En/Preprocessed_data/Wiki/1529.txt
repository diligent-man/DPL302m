In the astronomer James Pound became rector of Wanstead
In the Royal Society lent Pound Huygens's -foot focal length object-glass which he set up in Wanstead Park
Pound's observations with it of the five known satellites of Saturn enabled Halley to correct calculations of their movements and Newton employed in the third edition of the Principia his micrometrical measures of Jupiter's disc of Saturn's disc and ring and of the elongations of their satellites and obtained from him data for correcting the places of the comet of
Laplace also used Pound's observations of Jupiter's satellites for the determination of the planet's mass and Pound himself compiled in a set of tables for the first satellite into which he introduced an equation for the transmission of light
Pound trained his sister's son James Bradley and many of their observations were made together including the opposition of Mars in and the transit of Mercury on October
Their measurement of γ Virginis in was the first made of the components of a double star and was directed towards the determination of stellar parallax
In Bradley embarked upon a series of observations using a telescope of his own erected at the rectory in Wanstead now the site of Wanstead High School
This instrument had the advantage of a large field of view and he was able to obtain precise positions of a large number of stars that transited close to the zenith over the course of about two years
Combined with observations from his friend Samuel Molyneux's house at Kew in Surrey this established the existence of the phenomenon of aberration of light and also allowed Bradley to formulate a set of rules that would allow the calculation of the effect on any given star at a specified date
