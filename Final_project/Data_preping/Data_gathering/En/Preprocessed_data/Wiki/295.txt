The likelihood function often simply called the likelihood describes the joint probability of the observed data as a function of the parameters of the chosen statistical model For each specific parameter value
in the parameter space the likelihood function
therefore assigns a probabilistic prediction to the observed data
Since it is essentially the product of sampling densities the likelihood generally encapsulates both the data generating process as well as the missing data mechanism that produced the observed sample
To emphasize that the likelihood is not a probability density function p d f of the parameters it is often written as
displaystyle mathcal L theta mid X
In maximum likelihood estimation the likelihood function is maximized to obtain the specific value
displaystyle hat theta operatorname argmax theta in Theta mathcal L theta mid X
i e the value of the parameters of the probabilistic model under which the observed data is most probable or under which it has highest probability density in the case of continuous data Meanwhile in Bayesian statistics the likelihood function serves as the conduit through which sample information influences
displaystyle p theta mid X
the posterior probability of the parameter
The case for using likelihood was first made by R A Fisher who believed it to be a self contained framework for statistical modelling and inference Later Barnard and Birnbaum led a school of thought that advocated the likelihood principle postulating that all relevant information for inference is contained in the likelihood function In both frequentist and Bayesian statistics the likelihood function plays a fundamental role
The likelihood function is usually defined differently for discrete and continuous probability distributions A general definition is also possible as discussed below

Given no event no data the probability and thus likelihood is any non trivial event will have a lower likelihood
Consider a simple statistical model of a coin flip a single parameter
that expresses the fairness of the coin The parameter is the probability that a coin lands heads up H when tossed
can take on any value within the range to For a perfectly fair coin
Imagine flipping a fair coin twice and observing the following data two heads in two tosses HH Assuming that each successive coin flip is i i d then the probability of observing HH is
displaystyle P text HH mid p text H
Hence given the observed data HH the likelihood that the model parameter
equals is Mathematically this is written as
displaystyle mathcal L p text H mid text HH
This is not the same as saying that the probability that
given the observation HH is For that we could apply Bayes' theorem which implies that the posterior probability is proportional to the likelihood times the prior probability
Suppose that the coin is not a fair coin but instead it has
Then the probability of getting two heads is

More generally for each value of
we can calculate the corresponding likelihood The result of such calculations is displayed in Figure
In Figure the integral of the likelihood over the interval is That illustrates an important aspect of likelihoods likelihoods do not have to integrate or sum to unlike probabilities

displaystyle f theta mid x
the likelihood is equal to the probability density of the observed outcome
when the true value of the parameter is
and hence it is equal to a probability density over the outcome
i e the likelihood function is not a density over the parameter
displaystyle mathcal L theta mid x
is to hypothesis testing finding the probability of varying outcomes given a set of parameters defined in the null hypothesis as
displaystyle f theta mid x
is to inference finding the likely parameters given a specific outcome
In measure theoretic probability theory the density function is defined as the Radon Nikodym derivative of the probability distribution relative to a common dominating measure The likelihood function is that density interpreted as a function of the parameter possibly a vector rather than the possible outcomes This provides a likelihood function for any statistical model with all distributions whether discrete absolutely continuous a mixture or something else Likelihoods will be comparable e g for parameter estimation only if they are Radon Nikodym derivatives with respect to the same dominating measure
The discussion above of likelihood with discrete probabilities is a special case of this using the counting measure which makes the probability density at any outcome equal to the probability of that single outcome
Among many applications we consider here one of broad theoretical and practical importance Given a parameterized family of probability density functions or probability mass functions in the case of discrete distributions
displaystyle x mapsto f x mid theta
is the parameter the likelihood function is
displaystyle theta mapsto f x mid theta
displaystyle mathcal L theta mid x f x mid theta
is the observed outcome of an experiment In other words when
displaystyle f x mid theta
is viewed as a function of
fixed it is a probability density function and when viewed as a function of

This is not the same as the probability that those parameters are the right ones given the observed sample Attempting to interpret the likelihood of a hypothesis given observed evidence as the probability of the hypothesis is a common error with potentially disastrous consequences See prosecutor's fallacy for an example of this
From a geometric standpoint if we consider
displaystyle f x mid theta
as a function of two variables then the family of probability distributions can be viewed as a family of curves parallel to the
axis while the family of likelihood functions is the orthogonal curves parallel to the
The use of the probability density in specifying the likelihood function above is justified as follows Given an observation
the likelihood for the interval

is a constant is given by
displaystyle mathcal L theta mid x in x j x j h
displaystyle operatorname argmax theta mathcal L theta mid x in x j x j h operatorname argmax theta frac h mathcal L theta mid x in x j x j h
is positive and constant Because

is the probability density function it follows that

displaystyle operatorname argmax theta mathcal L theta mid x j operatorname argmax theta f x j mid theta
and so maximizing the probability density at
amounts to maximizing the likelihood of the specific observation
The above can be extended in a simple way to allow consideration of distributions which contain both discrete and continuous components Suppose that the distribution consists of a number of discrete probability masses
displaystyle f x mid theta
where the sum of all the
's added to the integral of
is always one Assuming that it is possible to distinguish an observation corresponding to one of the discrete probability masses from one which corresponds to the density component the likelihood function for an observation from the continuous component can be dealt with in the manner shown above For an observation from the discrete component the likelihood function for an observation from the discrete component is simply
displaystyle mathcal L theta mid x p k theta
is the index of the discrete probability mass corresponding to observation
because maximizing the probability mass or probability at
amounts to maximizing the likelihood of the specific observation
The fact that the likelihood function can be defined in a way that includes contributions that are not commensurate the density and the probability mass arises from the way in which the likelihood function is defined up to a constant of proportionality where this constant can change with the observation
but not with the parameter
In the context of parameter estimation the likelihood function is usually assumed to obey certain conditions known as regularity conditions These conditions are assumed in various proofs involving likelihood functions and need to be verified in each particular application For maximum likelihood estimation the existence of a global maximum of the likelihood function is of the utmost importance By the extreme value theorem it suffices that the likelihood function is continuous on a compact parameter space for the maximum likelihood estimator to exist While the continuity assumption is usually met the compactness assumption about the parameter space is often not as the bounds of the true parameter values are unknown In that case concavity of the likelihood function plays a key role
More specifically if the likelihood function is twice continuously differentiable on the k dimensional parameter space
assumed to be an open connected subset of
there exists a unique maximum

i e the likelihood function approaches a constant on the boundary of the parameter space
which may include the points at infinity if
M kel inen et al prove this result using Morse theory while informally appealing to a mountain pass property Mascarenhas restates their proof using the mountain pass theorem
In the proofs of consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator additional assumptions are made about the probability densities that form the basis of a particular likelihood function These conditions were first established by Chanda In particular for almost all
displaystyle frac partial log f partial theta r quad frac partial log f partial theta r partial theta s quad frac partial log f partial theta r partial theta s partial theta t
displaystyle r s t ldots k
in order to ensure the existence of a Taylor expansion Second for almost all

displaystyle int infty infty H rst z mathrm d z leq M infty
This boundedness of the derivatives is needed to allow for differentiation under the integral sign And lastly it is assumed that the information matrix
displaystyle mathbf I theta int infty infty frac partial log f partial theta r frac partial log f partial theta s f mathrm d z
displaystyle left mathbf I theta right
is finite This ensures that the score has a finite variance
The above conditions are sufficient but not necessary That is a model that does not meet these regularity conditions may or may not have a maximum likelihood estimator of the properties mentioned above Further in case of non independently or non identically distributed observations additional properties may need to be assumed
In Bayesian statistics almost identical regularity conditions are imposed on the likelihood function in order to justify the Laplace approximation of the posterior probability
A likelihood ratio is the ratio of any two specified likelihoods frequently written as
displaystyle Lambda theta theta mid x frac mathcal L theta mid x mathcal L theta mid x
The likelihood ratio is central to likelihoodist statistics the law of likelihood states that degree to which data considered as evidence supports one parameter value versus another is measured by the likelihood ratio
In frequentist inference the likelihood ratio is the basis for a test statistic the so called likelihood ratio test By the Neyman Pearson lemma this is the most powerful test for comparing two simple hypotheses at a given significance level Numerous other tests can be viewed as likelihood ratio tests or approximations thereof The asymptotic distribution of the log likelihood ratio considered as a test statistic is given by Wilks' theorem
The likelihood ratio is also of central importance in Bayesian inference where it is known as the Bayes factor and is used in Bayes' rule Stated in terms of odds Bayes' rule states that the posterior odds of two alternatives
is the prior odds times the likelihood ratio As an equation
displaystyle O A A mid B O A A cdot Lambda A A mid B
The likelihood ratio is not directly used in AIC based statistics Instead what is used is the relative likelihood of models see below
Since the actual value of the likelihood function depends on the sample it is often convenient to work with a standardized measure Suppose that the maximum likelihood estimate for the parameter is
Relative plausibilities of other values may be found by comparing the likelihoods of those other values with the likelihood of
The relative likelihood of is defined to be
displaystyle R theta frac mathcal L theta mid x mathcal L hat theta mid x
Thus the relative likelihood is the likelihood ratio discussed above with the fixed denominator
displaystyle mathcal L hat theta
This corresponds to standardizing the likelihood to have a maximum of
A likelihood region is the set of all values of whose relative likelihood is greater than or equal to a given threshold In terms of percentages a p likelihood region for is defined to be
displaystyle left theta R theta geq frac p right
If is a single real parameter a p likelihood region will usually comprise an interval of real values If the region does comprise an interval then it is called a likelihood interval
Likelihood intervals and more generally likelihood regions are used for interval estimation within likelihoodist statistics they are similar to confidence intervals in frequentist statistics and credible intervals in Bayesian statistics Likelihood intervals are interpreted directly in terms of relative likelihood not in terms of coverage probability frequentism or posterior probability Bayesianism
Given a model likelihood intervals can be compared to confidence intervals If is a single real parameter then under certain conditions a likelihood interval about likelihood for will be the same as a confidence interval coverage probability In a slightly different formulation suited to the use of log likelihoods see Wilks' theorem the test statistic is twice the difference in log likelihoods and the probability distribution of the test statistic is approximately a chi squared distribution with degrees of freedom df equal to the difference in df's between the two models therefore the e likelihood interval is the same as the confidence interval assuming difference in df's to be
In many cases the likelihood is a function of more than one parameter but interest focuses on the estimation of only one or at most a few of them with the others being considered as nuisance parameters Several alternative approaches have been developed to eliminate such nuisance parameters so that a likelihood can be written as a function of only the parameter or parameters of interest the main approaches are profile conditional and marginal likelihoods These approaches are also useful when a high dimensional likelihood surface needs to be reduced to one or two parameters of interest in order to allow a graph
It is possible to reduce the dimensions by concentrating the likelihood function for a subset of parameters by expressing the nuisance parameters as functions of the parameters of interest and replacing them in the likelihood function In general for a likelihood function depending on the parameter vector
that can be partitioned into
displaystyle mathbf theta left mathbf theta mathbf theta right
displaystyle mathbf hat theta mathbf hat theta left mathbf theta right
can be determined explicitly concentration reduces computational burden of the original maximization problem
For instance in a linear regression with normally distributed errors
displaystyle mathbf y mathbf X beta u
the coefficient vector could be partitioned into
displaystyle beta left beta beta right
and consequently the design matrix
displaystyle mathbf X left mathbf X mathbf X right
yields an optimal value function
displaystyle beta beta left mathbf X mathsf T mathbf X right mathbf X mathsf T left mathbf y mathbf X beta right
Using this result the maximum likelihood estimator for
can then be derived as
displaystyle hat beta left mathbf X mathsf T left mathbf I mathbf P right mathbf X right mathbf X mathsf T left mathbf I mathbf P right mathbf y
displaystyle mathbf P mathbf X left mathbf X mathsf T mathbf X right mathbf X mathsf T
is the projection matrix of
This result is known as the Frisch Waugh Lovell theorem
Since graphically the procedure of concentration is equivalent to slicing the likelihood surface along the ridge of values of the nuisance parameter
that maximizes the likelihood function creating an isometric profile of the likelihood function for a given
the result of this procedure is also known as profile likelihood In addition to being graphed the profile likelihood can also be used to compute confidence intervals that often have better small sample properties than those based on asymptotic standard errors calculated from the full likelihood
Sometimes it is possible to find a sufficient statistic for the nuisance parameters and conditioning on this statistic results in a likelihood which does not depend on the nuisance parameters
One example occurs in tables where conditioning on all four marginal totals leads to a conditional likelihood based on the non central hypergeometric distribution This form of conditioning is also the basis for Fisher's exact test
Sometimes we can remove the nuisance parameters by considering a likelihood based on only part of the information in the data for example by using the set of ranks rather than the numerical values Another example occurs in linear mixed models where considering a likelihood for the residuals only after fitting the fixed effects leads to residual maximum likelihood estimation of the variance components
A partial likelihood is an adaption of the full likelihood such that only a part of the parameters the parameters of interest occur in it It is a key component of the proportional hazards model using a restriction on the hazard function the likelihood does not contain the shape of the hazard over time
The likelihood given two or more independent events is the product of the likelihoods of each of the individual events
displaystyle Lambda A mid X land X Lambda A mid X cdot Lambda A mid X
This follows from the definition of independence in probability the probabilities of two independent events happening given a model is the product of the probabilities
This is particularly important when the events are from independent and identically distributed random variables such as independent observations or sampling with replacement In such a situation the likelihood function factors into a product of individual likelihood functions
The empty product has value which corresponds to the likelihood given no event being before any data the likelihood is always This is similar to a uniform prior in Bayesian statistics but in likelihoodist statistics this is not an improper prior because likelihoods are not integrated
Log likelihood function is a logarithmic transformation of the likelihood function often denoted by a lowercase l or
to contrast with the uppercase L or
for the likelihood Because logarithms are strictly increasing functions maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the log likelihood But for practical purposes it is more convenient to work with the log likelihood function in maximum likelihood estimation in particular since most common probability distributions notably the exponential family are only logarithmically concave and concavity of the objective function plays a key role in the maximization
Given the independence of each event the overall log likelihood of intersection equals the sum of the log likelihoods of the individual events This is analogous to the fact that the overall log probability is the sum of the log probability of the individual events In addition to the mathematical convenience from this the adding process of log likelihood has an intuitive interpretation as often expressed as support from the data When the parameters are estimated using the log likelihood for the maximum likelihood estimation each data point is used by being added to the total log likelihood As the data can be viewed as an evidence that support the estimated parameters this process can be interpreted as support from independent evidence adds and the log likelihood is the weight of evidence Interpreting negative log probability as information content or surprisal the support log likelihood of a model given an event is the negative of the surprisal of the event given the model a model is supported by an event to the extent that the event is unsurprising given the model
A logarithm of a likelihood ratio is equal to the difference of the log likelihoods
displaystyle log frac L A L B log L A log L B ell A ell B
Just as the likelihood given no event being the log likelihood given no event is which corresponds to the value of the empty sum without any data there is no support for any models
If the log likelihood function is smooth its gradient with respect to the parameter known as the score and written
displaystyle s n theta equiv nabla theta ell n theta
exists and allows for the application of differential calculus The basic way to maximize a differentiable function is to find the stationary points the points where the derivative is zero since the derivative of a sum is just the sum of the derivatives but the derivative of a product requires the product rule it is easier to compute the stationary points of the log likelihood of independent events than for the likelihood of independent events
The equations defined by the stationary point of the score function serve as estimating equations for the maximum likelihood estimator
displaystyle s n theta mathbf
In that sense the maximum likelihood estimator is implicitly defined by the value at
displaystyle s n mathbb E d to Theta
is the d dimensional Euclidean space and
is the parameter space Using the inverse function theorem it can be shown that
is well defined in an open neighborhood about
with probability going to one and
displaystyle hat theta n s n mathbf
is a consistent estimate of
As a consequence there exists a sequence
displaystyle left hat theta n right
displaystyle s n hat theta n mathbf
displaystyle hat theta n xrightarrow text p theta
A similar result can be established using Rolle's theorem
The second derivative evaluated at
known as Fisher information determines the curvature of the likelihood surface and thus indicates the precision of the estimate
The log likelihood is also particularly useful for exponential families of distributions which include many of the common parametric probability distributions The probability distribution function and thus likelihood function for exponential families contain products of factors involving exponentiation The logarithm of such a function is a sum of products again easier to differentiate than the original function
An exponential family is one whose probability density function is of the form for some functions writing
displaystyle p x mid boldsymbol theta h x exp Big langle boldsymbol eta boldsymbol theta mathbf T x rangle A boldsymbol theta Big
Each of these terms has an interpretation but simply switching from probability to likelihood and taking logarithms yields the sum
displaystyle ell boldsymbol theta mid x langle boldsymbol eta boldsymbol theta mathbf T x rangle A boldsymbol theta log h x
displaystyle boldsymbol eta boldsymbol theta
each correspond to a change of coordinates so in these coordinates the log likelihood of an exponential family is given by the simple formula
displaystyle ell boldsymbol eta mid x langle boldsymbol eta mathbf T x rangle A boldsymbol eta
In words the log likelihood of an exponential family is inner product of the natural parameter
minus the normalization factor log partition function
Thus for example the maximum likelihood estimate can be computed by taking derivatives of the sufficient statistic T and the log partition function A
The gamma distribution is an exponential family with two parameters

Finding the maximum likelihood estimate of
for a single observed value
looks rather daunting Its logarithm is much simpler to work with
displaystyle log mathcal L alpha beta mid x alpha log beta log Gamma alpha alpha log x beta x
To maximize the log likelihood we first take the partial derivative with respect to
displaystyle frac partial log mathcal L alpha beta mid x partial beta frac alpha beta x
If there are a number of independent observations
displaystyle x ldots x n
then the joint log likelihood will be the sum of individual log likelihoods and the derivative of this sum will be a sum of derivatives of each individual log likelihood
displaystyle begin aligned frac partial log mathcal L alpha beta mid x ldots x n partial beta frac partial log mathcal L alpha beta mid x partial beta cdots frac partial log mathcal L alpha beta mid x n partial beta frac n alpha beta sum i n x i end aligned

is the sample mean of the observations
The term likelihood has been in use in English since at least late Middle English Its formal use to refer to a specific function in mathematical statistics was proposed by Ronald Fisher in two research papers published in and The paper introduced what is today called a likelihood interval the paper introduced the term method of maximum likelihood Quoting Fisher
The concept of likelihood should not be confused with probability as mentioned by Sir Ronald Fisher
Fisher's invention of statistical likelihood was in reaction against an earlier form of reasoning called inverse probability His use of the term likelihood fixed the meaning of the term within mathematical statistics
A W F Edwards established the axiomatic basis for use of the log likelihood ratio as a measure of relative support for one hypothesis against another The support function is then the natural logarithm of the likelihood function Both terms are used in phylogenetics but were not adopted in a general treatment of the topic of statistical evidence
Among statisticians there is no consensus about what the foundation of statistics should be There are four main paradigms that have been proposed for the foundation frequentism Bayesianism likelihoodism and AIC based For each of the proposed foundations the interpretation of likelihood is different The four interpretations are described in the subsections below
In Bayesian inference although one can speak about the likelihood of any proposition or random variable given another random variable for example the likelihood of a parameter value or of a statistical model see marginal likelihood given specified data or other evidence the likelihood function remains the same entity with the additional interpretations of i a conditional density of the data given the parameter since the parameter is then a random variable and ii a measure or amount of information brought by the data about the parameter value or even the model Due to the introduction of a probability structure on the parameter space or on the collection of models it is possible that a parameter value or a statistical model have a large likelihood value for given data and yet have a low probability or vice versa This is often the case in medical contexts Following Bayes' Rule the likelihood when seen as a conditional density can be multiplied by the prior probability density of the parameter and then normalized to give a posterior probability density More generally the likelihood of an unknown quantity
is proportional to the probability of
In frequentist statistics the likelihood function is itself a statistic that summarizes a single sample from a population whose calculated value depends on a choice of several parameters p where p is the count of parameters in some already selected statistical model The value of the likelihood serves as a figure of merit for the choice used for the parameters and the parameter set with maximum likelihood is the best choice given the data available
The specific calculation of the likelihood is the probability that the observed sample would be assigned assuming that the model chosen and the values of the several parameters give an accurate approximation of the frequency distribution of the population that the observed sample was drawn from Heuristically it makes sense that a good choice of parameters is those which render the sample actually observed the maximum possible post hoc probability of having happened Wilks' theorem quantifies the heuristic rule by showing that the difference in the logarithm of the likelihood generated by the estimate's parameter values and the logarithm of the likelihood generated by population's true but unknown parameter values is asymptotically distributed
Each independent sample's maximum likelihood estimate is a separate estimate of the true parameter set describing the population sampled Successive estimates from many independent samples will cluster together with the population's true set of parameter values hidden somewhere in their midst The difference in the logarithms of the maximum likelihood and adjacent parameter sets' likelihoods may be used to draw a confidence region on a plot whose co ordinates are the parameters p The region surrounds the maximum likelihood estimate and all points parameter sets within that region differ at most in log likelihood by some fixed value The distribution given by Wilks' theorem converts the region's log likelihood differences into the confidence that the population's true parameter set lies inside The art of choosing the fixed log likelihood difference is to make the confidence acceptably high while keeping the region acceptably small narrow range of estimates
As more data are observed instead of being used to make independent estimates they can be combined with the previous samples to make a single combined sample and that large sample may be used for a new maximum likelihood estimate As the size of the combined sample increases the size of the likelihood region with the same confidence shrinks Eventually either the size of the confidence region is very nearly a single point or the entire population has been sampled in both cases the estimated parameter set is essentially the same as the population parameter set
Under the AIC paradigm likelihood is interpreted within the context of information theory
