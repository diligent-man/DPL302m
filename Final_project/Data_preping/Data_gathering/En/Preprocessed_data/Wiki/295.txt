The likelihood function (often simply called the likelihood) describes the joint probability of the observed data as a function of the parameters of the chosen statistical model
For each specific parameter value
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
in the parameter space, the likelihood function
p
(
X
|
θ
)
{\displaystyle p(X|\theta )}
therefore assigns a probabilistic prediction to the observed data
X
{\displaystyle X}
Since it is essentially the product of sampling densities, the likelihood generally encapsulates both the data-generating process as well as the missing-data mechanism that produced the observed sample.
To emphasize that the likelihood is not a probability density function (p.d.f.) of the parameters, it is often written as
L
(
θ
∣
X
)
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \mid X)}
In maximum likelihood estimation, the likelihood function is maximized to obtain the specific value
θ
^
=
argmax
θ
∈
Θ
⁡
L
(
θ
∣
X
)
{\displaystyle {\hat {\theta }}=\operatorname {argmax} _{\theta \in \Theta }{\mathcal {L}}(\theta \mid X)}
, i.e
the value of the parameters of the probabilistic model under which the observed data is most probable (or under which it has highest probability density, in the case of continuous data)
Meanwhile in Bayesian statistics, the likelihood function serves as the conduit through which sample information influences
p
(
θ
∣
X
)
{\displaystyle p(\theta \mid X)}
, the posterior probability of the parameter.
The case for using likelihood was first made by R
A
Fisher, who believed it to be a self-contained framework for statistical modelling and inference
Later, Barnard and Birnbaum led a school of thought that advocated the likelihood principle, postulating that all relevant information for inference is contained in the likelihood function
In both frequentist and Bayesian statistics, the likelihood function plays a fundamental role.
The likelihood function is usually defined differently for discrete and continuous probability distributions
A general definition is also possible, as discussed below.
Let
X
{\displaystyle X}
be a discrete random variable with probability mass function
p
{\displaystyle p}
depending on a parameter
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
Then the function
L
(
θ
∣
x
)
=
p
θ
(
x
)
=
P
θ
(
X
=
x
)
,
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \mid x)=p_{\theta }(x)=P_{\theta }(X=x),}
considered as a function of
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
, is the likelihood function, given the outcome
x
{\displaystyle x}
of the random variable
X
{\displaystyle X}
Sometimes the probability of "the value
x
{\displaystyle x}
of
X
{\displaystyle X}
for the parameter value
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
" is written as P(X = x | θ) or P(X = x; θ)
The likelihood is equal to the probability that a particular outcome
x
{\displaystyle x}
is observed when the true value of the parameter is
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
, it is equal to the probability density over
x
{\displaystyle x}
, it is not a probability density over the parameter
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
The likelihood,
L
(
θ
∣
x
)
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \mid x)}
, should not be confused with
p
(
θ
∣
x
)
{\displaystyle p(\theta \mid x)}
, which is the posterior probability of
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
given the data
x
{\displaystyle x}
.
Given no event (no data), the probability and thus likelihood is 1; any non-trivial event will have a lower likelihood.
Consider a simple statistical model of a coin flip: a single parameter
p
H
{\displaystyle p_{\text{H}}}
that expresses the "fairness" of the coin
The parameter is the probability that a coin lands heads up ("H") when tossed.
p
H
{\displaystyle p_{\text{H}}}
can take on any value within the range 0.0 to 1.0
For a perfectly fair coin,
p
H
=
0.5
{\displaystyle p_{\text{H}}=0.5}
.
Imagine flipping a fair coin twice, and observing the following data: two heads in two tosses ("HH")
Assuming that each successive coin flip is i.i.d., then the probability of observing HH is
P
(
HH
∣
p
H
=
0.5
)
=
0.5
2
=
0.25.
{\displaystyle P({\text{HH}}\mid p_{\text{H}}=0.5)=0.5^{2}=0.25.}
Hence, given the observed data HH, the likelihood that the model parameter
p
H
{\displaystyle p_{\text{H}}}
equals 0.5 is 0.25
Mathematically, this is written as
L
(
p
H
=
0.5
∣
HH
)
=
0.25.
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(p_{\text{H}}=0.5\mid {\text{HH}})=0.25.}
This is not the same as saying that the probability that
p
H
=
0.5
{\displaystyle p_{\text{H}}=0.5}
, given the observation HH, is 0.25
 (For that, we could apply Bayes' theorem, which implies that the posterior probability is proportional to the likelihood times the prior probability.)
Suppose that the coin is not a fair coin, but instead it has
p
H
=
0.3
{\displaystyle p_{\text{H}}=0.3}
Then the probability of getting two heads is
P
(
HH
∣
p
H
=
0.3
)
=
0.3
2
=
0.09.
{\displaystyle P({\text{HH}}\mid p_{\text{H}}=0.3)=0.3^{2}=0.09.}
Hence
L
(
p
H
=
0.3
∣
HH
)
=
0.09.
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(p_{\text{H}}=0.3\mid {\text{HH}})=0.09.}
More generally, for each value of
p
H
{\displaystyle p_{\text{H}}}
, we can calculate the corresponding likelihood
The result of such calculations is displayed in Figure 1.
In Figure 1, the integral of the likelihood over the interval [0, 1] is 1/3
That illustrates an important aspect of likelihoods: likelihoods do not have to integrate (or sum) to 1, unlike probabilities.
Let
X
{\displaystyle X}
be a random variable following an absolutely continuous probability distribution with the density function
f
{\displaystyle f}
(a function of
x
{\displaystyle x}
) which depends on a parameter
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
Then the function
L
(
θ
∣
x
)
=
f
θ
(
x
)
,
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \mid x)=f_{\theta }(x),\,}
considered as a function of
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
, is the likelihood function (of
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
, given the outcome
x
{\displaystyle x}
of
X
{\displaystyle X}
)
Sometimes the density function for "the value
x
{\displaystyle x}
of
X
{\displaystyle X}
given the parameter value
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
" is written as
f
(
x
∣
θ
)
{\displaystyle f(x\mid \theta )}
The likelihood function,
L
(
θ
∣
x
)
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \mid x)}
, should not be confused with
f
(
θ
∣
x
)
{\displaystyle f(\theta \mid x)}
; the likelihood is equal to the probability density of the observed outcome,
x
{\displaystyle x}
, when the true value of the parameter is
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
, and hence it is equal to a probability density over the outcome
x
{\displaystyle x}
, i.e
the likelihood function is not a density over the parameter
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
Put simply,
L
(
θ
∣
x
)
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \mid x)}
is to hypothesis testing (finding the probability of varying outcomes given a set of parameters defined in the null hypothesis) as
f
(
θ
∣
x
)
{\displaystyle f(\theta \mid x)}
is to inference (finding the likely parameters given a specific outcome).
In measure-theoretic probability theory, the density function is defined as the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the probability distribution relative to a common dominating measure
The likelihood function is that density interpreted as a function of the parameter (possibly a vector), rather than the possible outcomes
This provides a likelihood function for any statistical model with all distributions, whether discrete, absolutely continuous, a mixture or something else
 (Likelihoods will be comparable, e.g
for parameter estimation, only if they are Radon–Nikodym derivatives with respect to the same dominating measure.)
The discussion above of likelihood with discrete probabilities is a special case of this using the counting measure, which makes the probability density at any outcome equal to the probability of that single outcome.
Among many applications, we consider here one of broad theoretical and practical importance
 Given a parameterized family of probability density functions (or probability mass functions in the case of discrete distributions)
x
↦
f
(
x
∣
θ
)
,
{\displaystyle x\mapsto f(x\mid \theta ),\!}
where
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
is the parameter,  the likelihood function is
θ
↦
f
(
x
∣
θ
)
,
{\displaystyle \theta \mapsto f(x\mid \theta ),\!}
written
L
(
θ
∣
x
)
=
f
(
x
∣
θ
)
,
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \mid x)=f(x\mid \theta ),\!}
where
x
{\displaystyle x}
is the observed outcome of an experiment
 In other words, when
f
(
x
∣
θ
)
{\displaystyle f(x\mid \theta )}
is viewed as a function of
x
{\displaystyle x}
with
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
fixed, it is a probability density function, and when viewed as a function of
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
with
x
{\displaystyle x}
fixed, it is a likelihood function.
This is not the same as the probability that those parameters are the right ones, given the observed sample
Attempting to interpret the likelihood of a hypothesis given observed evidence as the probability of the hypothesis is a common error, with potentially disastrous consequences
See prosecutor's fallacy for an example of this.
From a geometric standpoint, if we consider
f
(
x
∣
θ
)
{\displaystyle f(x\mid \theta )}
as a function of two variables then the family of probability distributions can be viewed as a family of curves parallel to the
x
{\displaystyle x}
-axis, while the family of likelihood functions is the orthogonal curves parallel to the
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
-axis.
The use of the probability density in specifying the likelihood function above is justified as follows
Given an observation

j
{\displaystyle x_{j}}

and so maximizing the probability density at
x
j
{\displaystyle x_{j}}
amounts to maximizing the likelihood of the specific observation
x
j
{\displaystyle x_{j}}
.
The above can be extended in a simple way to allow consideration of distributions which contain both discrete and continuous components
Suppose that the distribution consists of a number of discrete probability masses
p
k
θ
{\displaystyle p_{k}\theta }
and a density
f
(
x
∣
θ
)
{\displaystyle f(x\mid \theta )}
, where the sum of all the
p
{\displaystyle p}
's added to the integral of
f
{\displaystyle f}
is always one
Assuming that it is possible to distinguish an observation corresponding to one of the discrete probability masses from one which corresponds to the density component, the likelihood function for an observation from the continuous component can be dealt with in the manner shown above
For an observation from the discrete component, the likelihood function for an observation from the discrete component is simply
L
(
θ
∣
x
)
=
p
k
(
θ
)
,
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \mid x)=p_{k}(\theta ),\!}
where
k
{\displaystyle k}
is the index of the discrete probability mass corresponding to observation
x
{\displaystyle x}
, because maximizing the probability mass (or probability) at
x
{\displaystyle x}
amounts to maximizing the likelihood of the specific observation.
The fact that the likelihood function can be defined in a way that includes contributions that are not commensurate (the density and the probability mass) arises from the way in which the likelihood function is defined up to a constant of proportionality, where this "constant" can change with the observation
x
{\displaystyle x}
, but not with the parameter
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
.
In the context of parameter estimation, the likelihood function is usually assumed to obey certain conditions, known as regularity conditions
These conditions are assumed in various proofs involving likelihood functions, and need to be verified in each particular application
For maximum likelihood estimation, the existence of a global maximum of the likelihood function is of the utmost importance
By the extreme value theorem, it suffices that the likelihood function is continuous on a compact parameter space for the maximum likelihood estimator to exist
While the continuity assumption is usually met, the compactness assumption about the parameter space is often not, as the bounds of the true parameter values are unknown
In that case, concavity of the likelihood function plays a key role.
More specifically, if the likelihood function is twice continuously differentiable on the k-dimensional parameter space
Θ
{\displaystyle \,\Theta \,}
assumed to be an open connected subset of
R
k

{\displaystyle \,\mathbb {R} ^{k}\;,}
there exists a unique maximum

Mäkeläinen et al
prove this result using Morse theory while informally appealing to a mountain pass property
Mascarenhas restates their proof using the mountain pass theorem.
In the proofs of consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, additional assumptions are made about the probability densities that form the basis of a particular likelihood function
These conditions were first established by Chanda

I

{\displaystyle \,\left|\mathbf {I} (\theta )\right|\,}

This ensures that the score has a finite variance.
The above conditions are sufficient, but not necessary
That is, a model that does not meet these regularity conditions may or may not have a maximum likelihood estimator of the properties mentioned above
Further, in case of non-independently or non-identically distributed observations additional properties may need to be assumed.
In Bayesian statistics, almost identical regularity conditions are imposed on the likelihood function in order to justify the Laplace approximation of the posterior probability.
A likelihood ratio is the ratio of any two specified likelihoods, frequently written as:
Λ
(
θ
1
:
θ
2
∣
x
)
=
L
(
θ
1
∣
x
)
L
(
θ
2
∣
x
)
{\displaystyle \Lambda (\theta _{1}:\theta _{2}\mid x)={\frac {{\mathcal {L}}(\theta _{1}\mid x)}{{\mathcal {L}}(\theta _{2}\mid x)}}}
The likelihood ratio is central to likelihoodist statistics: the law of likelihood states that degree to which data (considered as evidence) supports one parameter value versus another is measured by the likelihood ratio.
In frequentist inference, the likelihood ratio is the basis for a test statistic, the so-called likelihood-ratio test
By the Neyman–Pearson lemma, this is the most powerful test for comparing two simple hypotheses at a given significance level
Numerous other tests can be viewed as likelihood-ratio tests or approximations thereof
The asymptotic distribution of the log-likelihood ratio, considered as a test statistic, is given by Wilks' theorem.
The likelihood ratio is also of central importance in Bayesian inference, where it is known as the Bayes factor, and is used in Bayes' rule
Stated in terms of odds, Bayes' rule states that the posterior odds of two alternatives,
A
1
{\displaystyle A_{1}}
and
A
2
{\displaystyle A_{2}}
, given an event
B
{\displaystyle B}
, is the prior odds, times the likelihood ratio
As an equation:
O
(
A
1
:
A
2
∣
B
)
=
O
(
A
1
:
A
2
)
⋅
Λ
(
A
1
:
A
2
∣
B
)
.
{\displaystyle O(A_{1}:A_{2}\mid B)=O(A_{1}:A_{2})\cdot \Lambda (A_{1}:A_{2}\mid B).}
The likelihood ratio is not directly used in AIC-based statistics
Instead, what is used is the relative likelihood of models (see below).
Since the actual value of the likelihood function depends on the sample, it is often convenient to work with a standardized measure
Suppose that the maximum likelihood estimate for the parameter θ is
θ
^
{\displaystyle {\hat {\theta }}}
 Relative plausibilities of other θ values may be found by comparing the likelihoods of those other values with the likelihood of
θ
^
{\displaystyle {\hat {\theta }}}
 The relative likelihood of θ is defined to be
R
(
θ
)
=
L
(
θ
∣
x
)
L
(
θ
^
∣
x
)
.
{\displaystyle R(\theta )={\frac {{\mathcal {L}}(\theta \mid x)}{{\mathcal {L}}({\hat {\theta }}\mid x)}}.}
Thus, the relative likelihood is the likelihood ratio (discussed above) with the fixed denominator
L
(
θ
^
)
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}({\hat {\theta }})}
This corresponds to standardizing the likelihood to have a maximum of 1.
A likelihood region is the set of all values of θ whose relative likelihood is greater than or equal to a given threshold
In terms of percentages, a p% likelihood region for θ is defined to be
{
θ
:
R
(
θ
)
≥
p
100
}
.
{\displaystyle \left\{\theta :R(\theta )\geq {\frac {p}{100}}\right\}.}
If θ is a single real parameter, a p% likelihood region will usually comprise an interval of real values
If the region does comprise an interval, then it is called a likelihood interval.
Likelihood intervals, and more generally likelihood regions, are used for interval estimation within likelihoodist statistics: they are similar to confidence intervals in frequentist statistics and credible intervals in Bayesian statistics
Likelihood intervals are interpreted directly in terms of relative likelihood, not in terms of coverage probability (frequentism) or posterior probability (Bayesianism).
Given a model, likelihood intervals can be compared to confidence intervals
If θ is a single real parameter, then under certain conditions, a 14.65% likelihood interval (about 1:7 likelihood) for θ will be the same as a 95% confidence interval (19/20 coverage probability)
In a slightly different formulation suited to the use of log-likelihoods (see Wilks' theorem), the test statistic is twice the difference in log-likelihoods and the probability distribution of the test statistic is approximately a chi-squared distribution with degrees-of-freedom (df) equal to the difference in df's between the two models (therefore, the e likelihood interval is the same as the 0.954 confidence interval; assuming difference in df's to be 1).
In many cases, the likelihood is a function of more than one parameter but interest focuses on the estimation of only one, or at most a few of them, with the others being considered as nuisance parameters
Several alternative approaches have been developed to eliminate such nuisance parameters, so that a likelihood can be written as a function of only the parameter (or parameters) of interest: the main approaches are profile, conditional, and marginal likelihoods
These approaches are also useful when a high-dimensional likelihood surface needs to be reduced to one or two parameters of interest in order to allow a graph.
It is possible to reduce the dimensions by concentrating the likelihood function for a subset of parameters by expressing the nuisance parameters as functions of the parameters of interest and replacing them in the likelihood function
In general, for a likelihood function depending on the parameter vector

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {\theta }} _{2}=\mathbf {\hat {\theta }} _{2}\left(\mathbf {\theta } _{1}\right)}
can be determined explicitly, concentration reduces computational burden of the original maximization problem.
For instance, in a linear regression with normally distributed errors,
y
=
X
β
+
u
{\displaystyle \mathbf {y} =\mathbf {X} \beta +u}
, the coefficient vector could be partitioned into
β
=
[
β

:
β

{\displaystyle \beta =\left[\beta _{1}:\beta _{2}\right]}
(and consequently the design matrix
X
=
[
X

:
X
2
]
{\displaystyle \mathbf {X} =\left[\mathbf {X} _{1}:\mathbf {X} _{2}\right]}
)
Maximizing with respect to

yields an optimal value function

Using this result, the maximum likelihood estimator for

This result is known as the Frisch–Waugh–Lovell theorem.
Since graphically the procedure of concentration is equivalent to slicing the likelihood surface along the ridge of values of the nuisance parameter
β
2
{\displaystyle \beta _{2}}
that maximizes the likelihood function, creating an isometric profile of the likelihood function for a given
β
1
{\displaystyle \beta _{1}}
, the result of this procedure is also known as profile likelihood
In addition to being graphed, the profile likelihood can also be used to compute confidence intervals that often have better small-sample properties than those based on asymptotic standard errors calculated from the full likelihood.
Sometimes it is possible to find a sufficient statistic for the nuisance parameters, and conditioning on this statistic results in a likelihood which does not depend on the nuisance parameters.
One example occurs in 2×2 tables, where conditioning on all four marginal totals leads to a conditional likelihood based on the non-central hypergeometric distribution
This form of conditioning is also the basis for Fisher's exact test.
Sometimes we can remove the nuisance parameters by considering a likelihood based on only part of the information in the data, for example by using the set of ranks rather than the numerical values
Another example occurs in linear mixed models, where considering a likelihood for the residuals only after fitting the fixed effects leads to residual maximum likelihood estimation of the variance components.
A partial likelihood is an adaption of the full likelihood such that only a part of the parameters (the parameters of interest) occur in it
It is a key component of the proportional hazards model: using a restriction on the hazard function, the likelihood does not contain the shape of the hazard over time.
The likelihood, given two or more independent events, is the product of the likelihoods of each of the individual events:
Λ
(
A
∣
X
1
∧
X
2
)
=
Λ
(
A
∣
X
1
)
⋅
Λ
(
A
∣
X
2
)
{\displaystyle \Lambda (A\mid X_{1}\land X_{2})=\Lambda (A\mid X_{1})\cdot \Lambda (A\mid X_{2})}
This follows from the definition of independence in probability: the probabilities of two independent events happening, given a model, is the product of the probabilities.
This is particularly important when the events are from independent and identically distributed random variables, such as independent observations or sampling with replacement
In such a situation, the likelihood function factors into a product of individual likelihood functions.
The empty product has value 1, which corresponds to the likelihood, given no event, being 1: before any data, the likelihood is always 1
This is similar to a uniform prior in Bayesian statistics, but in likelihoodist statistics this is not an improper prior because likelihoods are not integrated.
Log-likelihood function is a logarithmic transformation of the likelihood function, often denoted by a lowercase l or
ℓ
{\displaystyle \ell }
, to contrast with the uppercase L or
L
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}
for the likelihood
Because logarithms are strictly increasing functions, maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood
But for practical purposes it is more convenient to work with the log-likelihood function in maximum likelihood estimation, in particular since most common probability distributions—notably the exponential family—are only logarithmically concave, and concavity of the objective function plays a key role in the maximization.
Given the independence of each event, the overall log-likelihood of intersection equals the sum of the log-likelihoods of the individual events
This is analogous to the fact that the overall log-probability is the sum of the log-probability of the individual events
In addition to the mathematical convenience from this, the adding process of log-likelihood has an intuitive interpretation, as often expressed as "support" from the data
When the parameters are estimated using the log-likelihood for the maximum likelihood estimation, each data point is used by being added to the total log-likelihood
As the data can be viewed as an evidence that support the estimated parameters, this process can be interpreted as "support from independent evidence adds", and the log-likelihood is the "weight of evidence"
Interpreting negative log-probability as information content or surprisal, the support (log-likelihood) of a model, given an event, is the negative of the surprisal of the event, given the model: a model is supported by an event to the extent that the event is unsurprising, given the model.
A logarithm of a likelihood ratio is equal to the difference of the log-likelihoods:

ℓ
(

.
{\displaystyle \log {\frac {L(A)}{L(B)}}=\log L(A)-\log L(B)=\ell (A)-\ell (B).}
Just as the likelihood, given no event, being 1, the log-likelihood, given no event, is 0, which corresponds to the value of the empty sum: without any data, there is no support for any models.
If the log-likelihood function is smooth, its gradient with respect to the parameter, known as the score and written
s
n
(
θ
)
≡
∇
θ
ℓ
n
(
θ
)
{\displaystyle s_{n}(\theta )\equiv \nabla _{\theta }\ell _{n}(\theta )}
, exists and allows for the application of differential calculus
The basic way to maximize a differentiable function is to find the stationary points (the points where the derivative is zero); since the derivative of a sum is just the sum of the derivatives, but the derivative of a product requires the product rule, it is easier to compute the stationary points of the log-likelihood of independent events than for the likelihood of independent events.
The equations defined by the stationary point of the score function serve as estimating equations for the maximum likelihood estimator.
s
n
(
θ
)

0
{\displaystyle s_{n}(\theta )=\mathbf {0} }
In that sense, the maximum likelihood estimator is implicitly defined by the value at

{\displaystyle \mathbf {0} }
of the inverse function
s

:
E
d

Θ
{\displaystyle s_{n}^{-1}:\mathbb {E} ^{d}\to \Theta }
, where
E
d
{\displaystyle \mathbb {E} ^{d}}
is the d-dimensional Euclidean space, and
Θ
{\displaystyle \Theta }
is the parameter space
Using the inverse function theorem, it can be shown that
s
n

{\displaystyle s_{n}^{-1}}
is well-defined in an open neighborhood about

{\displaystyle \mathbf {0} }
with probability going to one, and

(

{\displaystyle {\hat {\theta }}_{n}=s_{n}^{-1}(\mathbf {0} )}
is a consistent estimate of
θ
{\displaystyle \theta }
As a consequence there exists a sequence
{

{\displaystyle \left\{{\hat {\theta }}_{n}\right\}}
such that

A similar result can be established using Rolle's theorem.
The second derivative evaluated at
θ
^
{\displaystyle {\hat {\theta }}}
, known as Fisher information, determines the curvature of the likelihood surface, and thus indicates the precision of the estimate.
The log-likelihood is also particularly useful for exponential families of distributions, which include many of the common parametric probability distributions
The probability distribution function (and thus likelihood function) for exponential families contain products of factors involving exponentiation
The logarithm of such a function is a sum of products, again easier to differentiate than the original function.
An exponential family is one whose probability density function is of the form (for some functions, writing
⟨
−
,
−
⟩
{\displaystyle \langle -,-\rangle }
for the inner product):
p
(
x

{\displaystyle p(x\mid {\boldsymbol {\theta }})=h(x)\exp {\Big (}\langle {\boldsymbol {\eta }}({\boldsymbol {\theta }}),\mathbf {T} (x)\rangle -A({\boldsymbol {\theta }}){\Big )}.}
Each of these terms has an interpretation, but simply switching from probability to likelihood and taking logarithms yields the sum:
ℓ

θ

{\displaystyle \ell ({\boldsymbol {\theta }}\mid x)=\langle {\boldsymbol {\eta }}({\boldsymbol {\theta }}),\mathbf {T} (x)\rangle -A({\boldsymbol {\theta }})+\log h(x).}
The
η
(
θ
)
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\eta }}({\boldsymbol {\theta }})}
and
h
(
x
)
{\displaystyle h(x)}
each correspond to a change of coordinates, so in these coordinates, the log-likelihood of an exponential family is given by the simple formula:
ℓ

⟨

T

A

{\displaystyle \ell ({\boldsymbol {\eta }}\mid x)=\langle {\boldsymbol {\eta }},\mathbf {T} (x)\rangle -A({\boldsymbol {\eta }}).}
In words, the log-likelihood of an exponential family is inner product of the natural parameter
η
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\eta }}}
and the sufficient statistic
T
(
x
)
{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} (x)}
, minus the normalization factor (log-partition function)
A
(
η

{\displaystyle A({\boldsymbol {\eta }})}
Thus for example the maximum likelihood estimate can be computed by taking derivatives of the sufficient statistic T and the log-partition function A.

The term "likelihood" has been in use in English since at least late Middle English
Its formal use to refer to a specific function in mathematical statistics was proposed by Ronald Fisher, in two research papers published in 1921 and 1922
The 1921 paper introduced what is today called a "likelihood interval"; the 1922 paper introduced the term "method of maximum likelihood"
Quoting Fisher:
The concept of likelihood should not be confused with probability as mentioned by Sir Ronald Fisher
Fisher's invention of statistical likelihood was in reaction against an earlier form of reasoning called inverse probability
His use of the term "likelihood" fixed the meaning of the term within mathematical statistics.

Edwards (1972) established the axiomatic basis for use of the log-likelihood ratio as a measure of relative support for one hypothesis against another
The support function is then the natural logarithm of the likelihood function
Both terms are used in phylogenetics, but were not adopted in a general treatment of the topic of statistical evidence.
Among statisticians, there is no consensus about what the foundation of statistics should be
There are four main paradigms that have been proposed for the foundation: frequentism, Bayesianism, likelihoodism, and AIC-based
For each of the proposed foundations, the interpretation of likelihood is different
The four interpretations are described in the subsections below.
In Bayesian inference, although one can speak about the likelihood of any proposition or random variable given another random variable: for example the likelihood of a parameter value or of a statistical model (see marginal likelihood), given specified data or other evidence, the likelihood function remains the same entity, with the additional interpretations of (i) a conditional density of the data given the parameter (since the parameter is then a random variable) and (ii) a measure or amount of information brought by the data about the parameter value or even the model
Due to the introduction of a probability structure on the parameter space or on the collection of models, it is possible that a parameter value or a statistical model have a large likelihood value for given data, and yet have a low probability, or vice versa
This is often the case in medical contexts
Following Bayes' Rule, the likelihood when seen as a conditional density can be multiplied by the prior probability density of the parameter and then normalized, to give a posterior probability density
More generally, the likelihood of an unknown quantity
X
{\displaystyle X}
given another unknown quantity
Y
{\displaystyle Y}
is proportional to the probability of
Y
{\displaystyle Y}
given
X
{\displaystyle X}
.
In frequentist statistics, the likelihood function is itself a statistic that summarizes a single sample from a population, whose calculated value depends on a choice of several parameters θ1 ..
θp, where p is the count of parameters in some already-selected statistical model
The value of the likelihood serves as a figure of merit for the choice used for the parameters, and the parameter set with maximum likelihood is the best choice, given the data available.
The specific calculation of the likelihood is the probability that the observed sample would be assigned, assuming that the model chosen and the values of the several parameters θ give an accurate approximation of the frequency distribution of the population that the observed sample was drawn from
Heuristically, it makes sense that a good choice of parameters is those which render the sample actually observed the maximum possible post-hoc probability of having happened
Wilks' theorem quantifies the heuristic rule by showing that the difference in the logarithm of the likelihood generated by the estimate's parameter values and the logarithm of the likelihood generated by population's "true" (but unknown) parameter values is asymptotically χ distributed.
Each independent sample's maximum likelihood estimate is a separate estimate of the "true" parameter set describing the population sampled
Successive estimates from many independent samples will cluster together with the population's "true" set of parameter values hidden somewhere in their midst
The difference in the logarithms of the maximum likelihood and adjacent parameter sets' likelihoods may be used to draw a confidence region on a plot whose co-ordinates are the parameters θ1 ..
θp
The region surrounds the maximum-likelihood estimate, and all points (parameter sets) within that region differ at most in log-likelihood by some fixed value
The χ distribution given by Wilks' theorem converts the region's log-likelihood differences into the "confidence" that the population's "true" parameter set lies inside
The art of choosing the fixed log-likelihood difference is to make the confidence acceptably high while keeping the region acceptably small (narrow range of estimates).
As more data are observed, instead of being used to make independent estimates, they can be combined with the previous samples to make a single combined sample, and that large sample may be used for a new maximum likelihood estimate
As the size of the combined sample increases, the size of the likelihood region with the same confidence shrinks
Eventually, either the size of the confidence region is very nearly a single point, or the entire population has been sampled; in both cases, the estimated parameter set is essentially the same as the population parameter set.
Under the AIC paradigm, likelihood is interpreted within the context of information theory.
