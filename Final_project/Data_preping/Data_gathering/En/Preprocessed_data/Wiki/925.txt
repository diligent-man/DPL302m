furthermore declaratory language independence treaty wa sufficiently ambiguous brazilian could claim independence declared wa recognized mention wa also made may letter patent portuguese could claim recognition wa based previous concession
preamble treaty mentioned concession made mean letter patent may stated letter patent portuguese king recognized brazil independent empire son dom pedro emperor also stated portuguese monarch wa ceding transferring free sovereignty said empire

event pedro's unconditional confirmation abdication reinforced impossibility new union portugal brazil
pedro's abdication portuguese throne led separation brazilian portuguese monarchy since portuguese crown wa inherited queen maria ii successor brazilian crown came inherited pedro i's brazilian heir apparent prince pedro de alcantara would become future emperor pedro ii brazil
prince pedro de alcantara right portuguese crown born brazil december portuguese recognition independence brazil wa portuguese national portuguese constitution law foreigner could inherit portuguese crown
still princess maria da glria's accession throne portugal queen maria ii question arose whether still regarded brazilian princess place order succession whether article brazil's constitution prohibited foreigner succeeding crown applied foreigner considered excluded brazilian line succession
empire's constitution limited crown brazil emperor pedro legitimate descendant male-preference cognatic primogeniture system rendered foreigner incapable succeeding crown empowered general assembly empire's parliament settle doubt regarding right succession crown
issue queen maria ii's status brazilian line succession became pressing emperor pedro ii acceded brazilian throne minor since question wa longer whether queen portugal place brazilian line succession become question whether wa heiress presumptive brazilian crown first person line succeed
thus brazilian parliament settle matter decide wa first person line brazilian throne corresponding title princess imperial queen maria ii portugal princess januria brazil
minor brazilian law since one brazilian imperial family wa age regency empire wa discharged politician chosen general assembly accordance constitution
however question wa important event emperor pedro ii died producing descendant crown independent empire brazil could end coming queen portugal thus recreating personal union two monarchies
question became even pressing conclusion portuguese civil war maria ii liberal supporter maria's uncle absolutist claimant dom miguel deposed maria wa defeated surrendered claim portuguese throne concession evoramonte maria wa restored throne constitutional government recognized foreign power legitimate one assumed
although doubt two princess wa emperor pedro ii's heiress presumptive existed since abdication brazilian crown pedro maria ii wa time deposed queen although actively pursuing claim throne portugal
victory portuguese civil war however became actually reigning monarch whole brazilian political establishment fact foreign sovereign wa heiress presumptive brazilian crown wa highly worrying wa seen detrimental independence recently established brazilian nation
regency parliament brazil wanted avoid possibility personal union portugal recreated secure independence brazil
order settle question brazilian general assembly adopted statute signed law regent behalf emperor pedro ii october declaring queen maria ii portugal lost succession right crown brazil due condition foreigner descendant excluded brazilian line succession ruling princess januria descendant therefore first
thus abdication portuguese crown brazilian emperor pedro terminated brief personal union separated monarchy portugal brazil abdication coupled exclusion new portuguese queen maria ii brazilian line succession broke last remaining tie political union two nation securing preservation independence brazil putting end
