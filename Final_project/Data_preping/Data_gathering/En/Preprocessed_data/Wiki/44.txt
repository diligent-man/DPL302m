Jmtland dialects jamska ˈjmskɐ᷈ Swedish jmtska jmtmål constitute a group of closely related dialects spoken in the Swedish province of Jmtland
They are commonly used in the entire region with the exception of Frostviken in the northernmost part of the province where the local dialect is of Trøndersk origin due to its later settlement from Norway
In the eastern part of Jmtland the dialects are transitional to those of Ångermanland
The dialect group is commonly regarded and treated as a single entity
Some people consider it a language separate from Swedish
Jamtlandic shares many characteristics with both Trøndersk—the dialect spoken in Trøndelag Norway—and with the dialects spoken along the coast of Norrland Sweden
Due to this ambiguous position there has been a debate since the early th century whether Jamtlandic belongs to the West Norse or the East Norse language group
Jamtlandic cannot be uniquely defined belonging to either of these groups
Prior to and around the time of the dissolution of the SwedishNorwegian union Jamtlandic was undisputedly considered a dialect of Norwegian
See eg p in part one of Adolf Noreen's Vårt språk translated from Swedish
The Westnorthern Swedish Norwegian-Swedish originally Norwegian dialects in Srna and Idre the northwesternmost Dalarna Hrjedalen and Jmtland where though the language east of Östersund eventually passes into Medelpadian or ÅngermanlandicThe local name for the dialects is jamska whose literal equivalent in English would be Jamtish or Jmtish
There is however no common term for the dialects in English and academic sources call them by various names such as jamska jmtska Jmtish dialect Jmtlandic dialect Jmtland dialects or dialects of Jmtland
The endonym jamska is technically a definite form the indefinite form jaamskjamske is rarely used
Since the early th century whether Jamtlandic is a dialect or a language has been hotly debated
Proponents of Jamtlandic as a language point to the differences in vocabulary and pronunciation
A great percentage of the Jamtish speakers recognise Jamtish as a language rather than a Swedish dialect
There have been efforts to make the Swedish government recognise it as a minority language just as Yiddish and Sami
One of the more prominent people that have been active in the effort to make Jamtish a recognised language is Bo Oscarsson
Oscarsson has written books about the Jamtish languagedialect and even compiled dictionaries
According to the sagas the region called Jmtland was originally settled by fugitives from Trøndelag after Harald Fairhair united Norway in the th century
It became part of Norway during the reign of Haakon I in the th century and remained part of Norway until the th century
At that point it became part of Sweden
The history of the region accounts for many of the dialect's features
It is difficult to the trace the history of Jamtlandic dialects because written sources only exist from the early th century if not including the early th-century Frösö runestone or the th-century legal documents which can not be confirmed to have been written in Old Jamtlandic the assumed distinct Jamtlandic dialect of Old West Norse
Like all other central Scandinavian dialects Trønder dialects east Norwegian dialects Norrland dialects some Finland Swedish dialects the most characteristic feature of Jamtlandic is vowel balance an event that caused the vowel endings after heavy syllables to weaken and later even drop entirely in some dialects moving the tone over from ending to the root syllable example Old Norse kasta kʰɑ̂stɑ᷈ kʰɑ̂stə᷈ kʰɑ̂ɑ᷈st to throw while the endings after light syllables instead where reinforced and even caused a type of umlaut or vowel harmony on the root vowel example Old Norse lifa liβɑ liβɑˑ le̞ʋa lɐ̂ʋɐ᷈ to live
According to one theory this phenomenon has its roots in influence from the neighbouring Saami languages in medieval times
The old norse phonemic contrast of light and heavy syllables is partly preserved in eastern Jamtlandic and to some degree in Western Jamtlandic and in the Oviken parish in southwestern Jmtland
In eastern Jmtland and in Oviken parish short stressed syllables are preserved from Old Norse words like hǫku 'chin' lifa 'to live' which have evolved to h̞ke̞᷈ in Fors parish hɔ̂ke̞᷈ in Ragunda and Stugun parishes hɞ̂kɛ᷈ in Hllesjö parish and hkɵ᷈ in Oviken parish while lifa has become læ̂ʋa᷈ or similar in all of the parishes
In western Jmtland the short syllables are less stable and are often lengthened to long or half-long in accent words but is preserved in accent words Old Norse svið 'burned' has become sʋɛ̂ in Åre parish while accent words like Old Norse lofa 'to promise' duna 'to make noise' which have evolved to lɔ̂ˑʋo̞᷈ or lɔ̂ːʋɔ᷈ and d̪ɔ̂ːnɔ᷈ in Undersåker Kall and Åre parishes
Central- and southwestern Jamtlandic has preserved the Old Norse primay diphthongs ai au ey usually with pronunciations like e̞i̯ ɞɵ̯ y̯
In th Offerdal parish in western Jmtland ai and ey have monophthongized to ɛː and ː while au is preserved as æɵ̯
Eastern Jamtlandic spoken in the parishes Borgvattnet Ragunda Fors Stugun Håsjö Hllesjö has no diphthongs but has monophthongized ai to e̝ː ey to ø̝ː and au to ɵː ɞː ʌː or o̞ː
Southwestern Jamtlandic has not only preserved the original diphthongs but also similar to Icelandic and some dialects in norway diphthongized Old Norse to ɑu̯ in Myssjö parish ɔu̯ in Hackås and Oviken parishes and aɔ̯ in Berg and Rtan parishes
Jamtlandic like Icelandic Faroese and other northern Scandinavian dialects has both a voiced l and voiceless ɬ l-sound
This sound comes from a voiced l that has been partly assimilated by either a preceding s or t or a following t Old Norse kirtilinn 'gland' has become tʰɑ̂ːɬ̠l̠n̠᷈ tʰɑ̂ɬ̠ːl̠n̠᷈ or similar Old Norse slta 'to struggle to pull' has become ɬlt̪e̞᷈ ɬli᷈ːt̪ or similar and Old Norse allt 'all' has become aɬt or similar
There have been attempts to standardize the orthography of Jamtlandic
The attempt that has been the most popular is Vgledning för stavning av jamska and which is the work of the committee Akademien för jamska consisting of Bodil Bergner Berta Magnusson and Bo Oscarsson
The most prominent application of this orthography has been to prepare translations of parts of the Bible into Jamtlandic resulting in the book Nagur Bibelteksta på jamska
Å Gud saa ’Ltt oss gjra når mnish nager som e lik oss
Å dom ske rå öve fishn derri havan å över foglan pyne himmela å öve tamdjura öve heile jola å öve all de djur som kravl å rör se på jorn´Å Gud skapa mnishan å gjool som n avbild ta se sjlv
Te kær å kviin skapa n domThe book does not fully follow Vgledning för stavning av jamska
For example using Vgledning för stavning av jamska one would spell gjæra v
Another spelling convention in Nagur Bibelteksta på jamska is the use of the digraph sh in eg
'the fish' with the same pronunciation as English 'sh' in 'shoe'
Properly using Vgledning för stavning av jamska this would be spelled sch see § in the external link below
