j mtland dialects jamska j msk swedish j mtska j mtm l constitute a group of closely related dialects spoken in the swedish province of j mtland
they are commonly used in the entire region with the exception of frostviken in the northernmost part of the province where the local dialect is of tr ndersk origin due to its later settlement from norway
in the eastern part of j mtland the dialects are transitional to those of ngermanland
the dialect group is commonly regarded and treated as a single entity
some people consider it a language separate from swedish
jamtlandic shares many characteristics with both tr ndersk the dialect spoken in tr ndelag norway and with the dialects spoken along the coast of norrland sweden
due to this ambiguous position there has been a debate since the early th century whether jamtlandic belongs to the west norse or the east norse language group
jamtlandic cannot be uniquely defined belonging to either of these groups
prior to and around the time of the dissolution of the swedish norwegian union jamtlandic was undisputedly considered a dialect of norwegian
see e g p in part one of adolf noreen s v rt spr k translated from swedish
the westnorthern swedish norwegian swedish originally norwegian dialects in s rna and idre the northwesternmost dalarna h rjedalen and j mtland where though the language east of stersund eventually passes into medelpadian or ngermanlandic the local name for the dialects is jamska whose literal equivalent in english would be jamtish or j mtish
there is however no common term for the dialects in english and academic sources call them by various names such as jamska j mtska j mtish dialect j mtlandic dialect j mtland dialects or dialects of j mtland
the endonym jamska is technically a definite form the indefinite form jaamsk jamske is rarely used
since the early th century whether jamtlandic is a dialect or a language has been hotly debated
proponents of jamtlandic as a language point to the differences in vocabulary and pronunciation
a great percentage of the jamtish speakers recognise jamtish as a language rather than a swedish dialect
there have been efforts to make the swedish government recognise it as a minority language just as yiddish and sami
one of the more prominent people that have been active in the effort to make jamtish a recognised language is bo oscarsson
oscarsson has written books about the jamtish language dialect and even compiled dictionaries
according to the sagas the region called j mtland was originally settled by fugitives from tr ndelag after harald fairhair united norway in the th century
it became part of norway during the reign of haakon i in the th century and remained part of norway until the th century
at that point it became part of sweden
the history of the region accounts for many of the dialect s features
it is difficult to the trace the history of jamtlandic dialects because written sources only exist from the early th century if not including the early th century fr s runestone or the th century legal documents which can not be confirmed to have been written in old jamtlandic the assumed distinct jamtlandic dialect of old west norse
like all other central scandinavian dialects tr nder dialects east norwegian dialects norrland dialects some finland swedish dialects the most characteristic feature of jamtlandic is vowel balance an event that caused the vowel endings after heavy syllables to weaken and later even drop entirely in some dialects moving the tone over from ending to the root syllable example old norse kasta k st k st k st to throw while the endings after light syllables instead where reinforced and even caused a type of umlaut or vowel harmony on the root vowel example old norse lifa li li le a l to live
according to one theory this phenomenon has its roots in influence from the neighbouring saami languages in medieval times
the old norse phonemic contrast of light and heavy syllables is partly preserved in eastern jamtlandic and to some degree in western jamtlandic and in the oviken parish in southwestern j mtland
in eastern j mtland and in oviken parish short stressed syllables are preserved from old norse words like h ku chin lifa to live which have evolved to h ke in fors parish h ke in ragunda and stugun parishes h k in h llesj parish and h k in oviken parish while lifa has become l a or similar in all of the parishes
in western j mtland the short syllables are less stable and are often lengthened to long or half long in accent words but is preserved in accent words old norse svi burned has become s in re parish while accent words like old norse lofa to promise duna to make noise which have evolved to l o or l and d n in unders ker kall and re parishes
central and southwestern jamtlandic has preserved the old norse primay diphthongs ai au ey usually with pronunciations like e i y
in th offerdal parish in western j mtland ai and ey have monophthongized to and while au is preserved as
eastern jamtlandic spoken in the parishes borgvattnet ragunda fors stugun h sj h llesj has no diphthongs but has monophthongized ai to e ey to and au to or o
southwestern jamtlandic has not only preserved the original diphthongs but also similar to icelandic and some dialects in norway diphthongized old norse to u in myssj parish u in hack s and oviken parishes and a in berg and r tan parishes
jamtlandic like icelandic faroese and other northern scandinavian dialects has both a voiced l and voiceless l sound
this sound comes from a voiced l that has been partly assimilated by either a preceding s or t or a following t old norse kirtilinn gland has become t l n t l n or similar old norse sl ta to struggle to pull has become l t e l i t or similar and old norse allt all has become a t or similar
there have been attempts to standardize the orthography of jamtlandic
the attempt that has been the most popular is v gledning f r stavning av jamska and which is the work of the committee akademien f r jamska consisting of bodil bergner berta magnusson and bo oscarsson
the most prominent application of this orthography has been to prepare translations of parts of the bible into jamtlandic resulting in the book nagur bibelteksta p jamska
