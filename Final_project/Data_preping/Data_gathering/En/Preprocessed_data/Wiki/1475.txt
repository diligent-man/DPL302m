the executive office of the president eop comprises the offices and agencies that support the work of the president at the center of the executive branch of the united states federal government
the eop consists of several offices and agencies such as the white house office the staff working directly for and reporting to the president including west wing staff and the president s closest advisers the national security council and the office of management and budget
the eop is also referred to as a permanent government with many policy programs and the people who implement them continuing between presidential administrations
this is because there is a need for qualified knowledgeable civil servants in each office or agency to inform new politicians
the civil servants who work in the executive office of the president are also regarded as nonpartisan and politically neutral so that they can give impartial advice
with the increase in technological and global advancement the size of the white house staff has increased to include an array of policy experts to effectively address various fields
in there were about positions in the eop most of which did not require confirmation from the u s
senate
the eop is overseen by the white house chief of staff
since january that position has been held by ron klain who was appointed by president joe biden
in the brownlow committee which was a presidentially commissioned panel of political science and public administration experts recommended sweeping changes to the executive branch of the united states government including the creation of the executive office of the president
based on these recommendations president franklin d
roosevelt in lobbied congress to approve the reorganization act of
the act led to reorganization plan no
which created the eop which reported directly to the president
the eop encompassed two subunits at its outset the white house office who and the bureau of the budget the predecessor to today s office of management and budget which had been created in and originally located in the treasury department
it absorbed most of the functions of the national emergency council
initially the new staff system appeared more ambitious on paper than in practice the increase in the size of the staff was quite modest at the start
however it laid the groundwork for the large and organizationally complex white house staff that would emerge during the presidencies of roosevelt s successors
roosevelt s efforts are also notable in contrast to those of his predecessors in office
during the th century presidents had few staff resources
thomas jefferson had one messenger and one secretary at his disposal both of whose salaries were paid by the president personally
it was not until that congress appropriated money for the hiring of one clerk
by ulysses s
grant s presidency the staff had grown to three
by the white house staff included one secretary to the president then the title of the president s chief aide two assistant secretaries two executive clerks a stenographer and seven other office personnel
under warren g
harding there were thirty one staff although most were clerical positions
during herbert hoover s presidency two additional secretaries to the president were added by congress one of whom hoover designated as his press secretary
from to as he greatly expanded the scope of the federal government s policies and powers in response to the great depression roosevelt relied on his brain trust of top advisers who were often appointed to vacant positions in agencies and departments from which they drew their salaries since the white house lacked statutory or budgetary authority to create new staff positions
after world war ii in particular during the presidency of dwight david eisenhower the staff was expanded and reorganized
eisenhower a former u s
army general had been supreme allied commander during the war and reorganized the executive office to suit his leadership style
today the staff is much bigger
estimates indicate some to persons serve in eop staff positions with policy making responsibilities with a budget of to million george w
bush s budget request for fiscal year was for million in support of personnel
some observers have noted a problem of control for the president due to the increase in staff and departments making coordination and cooperation between the various departments of the executive office more difficult
the president had the power to reorganize the executive office due to the reorganization act which gave the president considerable discretion until when it was renewed due to president reagan s administration allegedly encountering disloyalty and obstruction
the chief of staff is the head of the executive office and can therefore ultimately decide what the president needs to deal with personally and what can be dealt with by other staff in order to avoid wasting the time of the president
senior staff within the executive office of the president have the title assistant to the president second level staff have the title deputy assistant to the president and third level staff have the title special assistant to the president
the core white house staff appointments and most executive office officials generally are not required to be confirmed by the u s
senate although there are a handful of exceptions e g the director of the office of management and budget the chair and members of the council of economic advisers and the united states trade representative
the information in the following table is current as of january
only principal executives are listed for subordinate officers see individual office pages
the white house office including its various offices listed below is a sub unit of the executive office of the president eop
the various agencies of the eop are listed above
congress as well as the president has some control over the executive office of the president
some of this authority stems from its appropriation powers given by the constitution such as the power of the purse which affects the office of management and budget and the funding of the rest of federal departments and agencies
congress also has the right to investigate the operation of the executive office normally holding hearings bringing forward individual personnel to testify before a congressional committee
the executive office often helps with legislation by filling in specific points understood and written by experts as congressional legislation sometimes starts in broad terms
