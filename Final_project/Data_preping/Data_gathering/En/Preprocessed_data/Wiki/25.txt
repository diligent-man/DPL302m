the term culture industry german kulturindustrie was coined by the critical theorists theodor adorno and max horkheimer and was presented as critical vocabulary in the chapter the culture industry enlightenment as mass deception of the book dialectic of enlightenment wherein they proposed that popular culture is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods films radio programmes magazines etc that are used to manipulate mass society into passivity
consumption of the easy pleasures of popular culture made available by the mass communications media renders people docile and content no matter how difficult their economic circumstances
the inherent danger of the culture industry is the cultivation of false psychological needs that can only be met and satisfied by the products of capitalism thus adorno and horkheimer especially perceived mass produced culture as dangerous to the more technically and intellectually difficult high arts
in contrast true psychological needs are freedom creativity and genuine happiness which refer to an earlier demarcation of human needs established by herbert marcuse
members of the frankfurt school were much influenced by the dialectical materialism and historical materialism of karl marx as well as the revisitation of the dialectical idealism of hegel both events are studied not in isolation but as part of the process of change
as a group later joined by j rgen habermas they were responsible for the formulation of critical theory
in works such as dialectic of enlightenment and negative dialectics adorno and horkheimer theorized that the phenomenon of mass culture has a political implication namely that all the many forms of popular culture are parts of a single culture industry whose purpose is to ensure the continued obedience of the masses to market interests
the essay is concerned with the production of cultural content in capitalist societies
it critiques the extortionate nature of cultural economies as well as the apparently inferior products of the system
horkheimer and adorno argue that mass produced entertainment aims by its very nature to appeal to vast audiences and therefore both the intellectual stimulation of high art and the basic release of low art
the essay does not suggest that all products of this system are inherently inferior simply that they have replaced other forms of entertainment without properly fulfilling the important roles played by the now defunct sources of culture
horkheimer and adorno make consistent comparisons between fascist germany and the american film industry
they highlight the presence of mass produced culture created and disseminated by exclusive institutions and consumed by a passive homogenised audience in both systems
this illustrates the logic of domination in post enlightenment modern society by monopoly capitalism or the nation state
horkheimer and adorno draw attention to the problems associated with a system that integrates its consumers from above arguing that in attempting to realise enlightenment values of reason and order the holistic power of the individual is undermined
adorno and horkheimer s work was influenced by both the broader socio political environment in which it was written and by other major theorists
written in california in the early s in an era which characterized them as two ethnically jewish german migr s the culture industry is influenced by european politics and the war by which the continent was consumed
simultaneously the american film industry was characterised by an unprecedented level of studio monopolisation it was hollywood at its most classical american mass culture at its most fordist
horkheimer and adorno were influenced heavily by major developers of social political and economic theory most notably
karl marx s theories of alienation and commodity fetishism
max weber s instrumental reason and
georg lukacs concept of the reification of consciousness anything made by a person is a materialization of their labour and an expression of their intentions
there will also be a use value the benefit to the consumer will be derived from its utility
the exchange value will reflect its utility and the conditions of the market the prices paid by the television broadcaster or at the box office
yet the modern soap operas with their interchangeable plots and formulaic narrative conventions reflect standardized production techniques and the falling value of a mass produced cultural product
only rarely is a film released that makes a more positive impression on the general discourse and achieves a higher exchange value e g
patton starring george c
scott as the eponymous american general was released at a time of considerable anti war sentiment
the opening shot is of patton in front of an american flag making an impassioned speech
this was a form of dialectic in which the audience could identify with the patriotism either sincerely the thesis or ironically the antithesis and so set the tone of the interpretation for the remainder of the film
however the film is manipulating specific historical events not only as entertainment but also as a form of propaganda by demonstrating a link between success in strategic resource management situations and specified leadership qualities
given that the subtext was instrumental and not value free ethical and philosophical considerations arise
normally only high art criticizes the world outside its boundaries but access to this form of communication is limited to the elite classes where the risks of introducing social instability are slight
a film like patton is popular art which intends controversy in a world of social order and unity which according to adorno is regressing into a cultural blandness
to hegel order is good a priori i e
it does not have to answer to those living under it
but if order is disturbed in negative dialectics adorno believed this tended towards progress by stimulating the possibility of class conflict
marx s theory of historical materialism was teleological i e
society follows through a dialectic of unfolding stages from ancient modes of production to feudalism to capitalism to a future communism
but adorno felt that the culture industry would never permit a sufficient core of challenging material to emerge on to the market that might disturb the status quo and stimulate the final communist state to emerge
a center point of the dialectic of enlightenment is the topic of the enlightenment as mass deception the term culture industry is intended to refer to the commercial marketing of culture the branch of industry that deals specifically with the production of culture that is in contrast to authentic culture
horkheimer and adorno contend that industrially produced culture robs people of their imagination and takes over their thinking for them
the culture industry delivers the goods so that the people then only have left the task of consuming them
through mass production everything becomes homogenized and whatever diversity remains is constituted of small trivialities
everything becomes compressed through a process of the imposition of schemas under the premise that what s best is to mirror physical reality as closely as possible
psychological drives become stoked to the point where sublimation is no longer possible
movies serve as an example
all films have become similar in their basic form
they are shaped to reflect facts of reality as closely as possible
even fantasy films which claim to not reflect such reality don t really live up to what they claim to be
no matter how unusual they strive to be the endings are usually easy to predict because of the existence of prior films which followed the same schemas
also for example erotic depictions become so strong and so pronounced that a transformation to other forms is no longer possible
the aims of the culture industry are as in every industry economic in nature
all endeavors become focused on economic success
authentic culture however is not goal oriented but is an end in itself
authentic culture fosters the capacity of human imagination by presenting suggestions and possibilities but in a different way than the culture industry does since it leaves room for independent thought
authentic culture does not become channeled into regurgitating reality but goes levels beyond such
authentic culture is unique and cannot be forced into any pre formed schemas
as for discovering the causes of the development of the culture industry horkheimer and adorno contend that it arises from companies pursuit of the maximization of profit in the economic sense
however this cannot be said to be culture or what culture is supposed to be
it can only be described as being a form of commerce just like any other kind of commerce
the culture industry argument is often assumed to be fundamentally pessimistic in nature because its purveyors seem to condemn mass media and their consumers
however for adorno the term culture industry does not refer to mass culture or the culture of the masses of people in terms of something being produced by the masses and conveying the representations of the masses
on the contrary such involvement of the masses is only apparent or a type of seeming democratic participation
adorno contends that what is actually occurring is a type of defrauding of the masses
horkheimer and adorno deliberately chose the term culture industry instead of mass culture or mass media
the culture industry perpetually cheats its consumers of what it perpetually promises the culture industry even encroaches upon the small distractions of leisure activity amusement has become an extension of labor under late capitalism horkheimer and adorno above all in their critical analyses delve into what they call the fraying of art and the de artification of art and discuss how the arts are defused by the culture industry
works of art have become commodified beethoven mozart and wagner are only used in fragmentary forms when included in advertisement
according to critical theory selling out is not the decisive factor involved but rather it s the manner in which art is commodified and how art and culture are changed that is the crucial issue
culture today is infecting everything with sameness for adorno and horkheimer subversion has become no longer possible
wiggershaus states the other side of adorno s apparently paradoxical definition was ignored that rational objectivity was still possible for the modern work of art in any significant sense only as a product of subjectivity this would deny adorno contemporary political significance arguing that politics in a prosperous society is more concerned with action than with thought
he also notes that the young generation of critical theorists largely ignore adorno s work which in part stems from adorno s inability to draw practical conclusions from his theories
adorno is also accused of a lack of consistency in his claims to be implementing marxism
whereas he accepted the classical marxist analysis of society showing how one class exercises domination over another he deviated from marx in his failure to use dialectics as a method to propose ways to change
marx s theory depended on the willingness of the working class to overthrow the ruling class but adorno and horkheimer postulated that the culture industry has undermined the revolutionary movement
adorno s idea that the mass of the people are only objects of the culture industry is linked to his feeling that the time when the working class could be the tool of overthrowing capitalism is over
adorno s work is still of interest
writing in the new yorker in music critic alex ross argued that adorno s work has a renewed importance in the digital age the pop hegemony is all but complete its superstars dominating the media and wielding the economic might of tycoons culture appears more monolithic than ever with a few gigantic corporations google apple facebook amazon presiding over unprecedented monopolies
scholar jack zipes influenced by adorno critiqued the mass commercialisation and corporate hegemony behind the harry potter franchise
he argued that the commodities of the culture industry are popular because they are homogenous and obey standard conventions the media then influences the tastes of children
in his analysis of harry potter s global brand zipes wrote it must conform to the standards of exception set by the mass media and promoted by the culture industry in general
to be a phenomenon means that a person or commodity must conform to the hegemonic groups that determine what makes up a phenomenon
