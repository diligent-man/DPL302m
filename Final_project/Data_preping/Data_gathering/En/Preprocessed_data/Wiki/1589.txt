ahimsa sanskrit iast ahi s lit nonviolence less commonly spelled ahinsa is an ancient indian principle of nonviolence which applies to all living beings
it is a key virtue in the dh rmic religions hinduism buddhism and jainism
ahimsa is one of the cardinal virtues of jainism where it is first of the pancha mahavrata
it is also the first of the five precepts of buddhism
ahimsa is a multidimensional concept inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy therefore to hurt another being is to hurt oneself
ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences
while ancient scholars of hinduism pioneered and refined the principles of ahimsa the concept also reached an extraordinary development in the ethical philosophy of jainism
lord parsvanatha the twenty third tirthankara of jainism revived and preached the concept of non violence in the th century bce
mahavira the twenty fourth and the last tirthankara further strengthened the idea in the th century bce
between the st century bce and th century ce valluvar emphasized ahimsa and moral vegetarianism as virtues for an individual which formed the core of his teachings
perhaps the most popular advocate of the principle of ahimsa in the modern times was mahatma gandhi
ahimsa s precept of cause no injury includes one s deeds words and thoughts
classical hindu texts like the mahabharata and ramayana as well as modern scholars debate principles of ahimsa when one is faced with war and situations requiring self defence
historical indian literature has in this way contributed to modern theories of just war and self defence
the word ahimsa sometimes spelled ahinsa is derived from the sanskrit root hi s meaning to strike hi s is injury or harm while a hi s its opposite is non harming or nonviolence
the idea of reverence for ahi s exist in hindu jain and buddhist canonical texts
parshvanatha preached ahimsa as one of the four vows in th century bce
no other indian religion has developed the non violence doctrine and its implications on everyday life as has jainism
ahimsa as an ethical concept evolved in the vedic texts
the oldest scriptures indirectly mention ahimsa but do not emphasize it
over time the hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasized until ahimsa becomes the highest virtue by the late vedic era about bce
for example hymn in the rig veda uses the words satya truthfulness and ahimsa in a prayer to deity indra later the yajur veda dated to be between bce and bce states may all beings look at me with a friendly eye may i do likewise and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend
the term ahimsa appears in the text taittiriya shakha of the yajurveda ts where it refers to non injury to the sacrificer himself
it occurs several times in the shatapatha brahmana in the sense of non injury
the ahimsa doctrine is a late vedic era development in brahmanical culture
the earliest reference to the idea of non violence to animals pashu ahimsa apparently in a moral sense is in the kapisthala katha samhita of the yajurveda kaps which may have been written in about the th century bce
bowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal upanishads
kaneda gives examples of the word ahimsa in these upanishads
other scholars suggest ahimsa as an ethical concept that started evolving in the vedas becoming an increasingly central concept in upanishads
the ch ndogya upani ad dated to the th or th century bce one of the oldest upanishads has the earliest evidence for the vedic era use of the word ahimsa in the sense familiar in hinduism a code of conduct
it bars violence against all creatures sarvabhuta and the practitioner of ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of rebirths cu
some scholars state that this th or th century bce mention may have been an influence of jainism on vedic hinduism
others scholar state that this relationship is speculative and though jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of jainism tradition are from many centuries after the vedic era ended
ch ndogya upani ad also names ahimsa along with satyavacanam truthfulness rjavam sincerity d nam charity tapo penance meditation as one of five essential virtues cu
the sandilya upanishad lists ten forbearances ahimsa satya asteya brahmacharya daya arjava kshama dhriti mitahara and saucha
according to kaneda the term ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by hinduism buddhism and jainism
it literally means non injury and non killing
it implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds but also by words and in thoughts
the mahabharata one of the epics of hinduism has multiple mentions of the phrase ahimsa paramo dharma which literally means non violence is the highest moral virtue
for example anushasana parva has the verse
the above passage from mahabharata emphasises the cardinal importance of ahimsa in hinduism and literally means
ahimsa is the highest dharma ahimsa is the highest self control
ahimsa is the greatest gift ahimsa is the best practice
ahimsa is the highest sacrifice ahimsa is the finest strength
ahimsa is the greatest friend ahimsa is the greatest happiness
ahimsa is the highest truth and ahimsa is the greatest teaching
some other examples where the phrase ahimsa paramo dharma are discussed include adi parva vana parva and anushasana parva
the bhagavad gita among other things discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war
these verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self defence and the theories of just war
however there is no consensus on this interpretation
gandhi for example considers this debate about non violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being when he or she faces moral questions
the classical texts of hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of ahimsa can and must do when they are faced with war violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime
these discussions have led to theories of just war theories of reasonable self defence and theories of proportionate punishment
arthashastra discusses among other things why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment
warthe precepts of ahimsa under hinduism require that war must be avoided with sincere and truthful dialogue
force must be the last resort
if war becomes necessary its cause must be just its purpose virtuous its objective to restrain the wicked its aim peace its method lawful
war can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority
weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war not indiscriminate tools of destruction
all strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent not designed to cause misery to the opponent for example use of arrows is allowed but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed
warriors must use judgment in the battlefield
cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden
wounded unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment
children women and civilians must not be injured
while the war is in progress sincere dialogue for peace must continue
self defencein matters of self defence different interpretations of ancient hindu texts have been offered
for example t htinen suggests self defence is appropriate criminals are not protected by the rule of ahimsa and hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker
ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism
alternate theories of self defence inspired by ahimsa build principles similar to theories of just war
aikido pioneered in japan illustrates one such principles of self defence
morihei ueshiba the founder of aikido described his inspiration as ahimsa
according to this interpretation of ahimsa in self defence one must not assume that the world is free of aggression
one must presume that some people will out of ignorance error or fear attack other persons or intrude into their space physically or verbally
the aim of self defence suggested ueshiba must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker and avoid the conflict
the best defence is one where the victim is protected as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible
under ahimsa and aikido there are no enemies and appropriate self defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker
criminal lawt htinen concludes that hindus have no misgivings about the death penalty their position is that evil doers who deserve death should be killed and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons
other scholars conclude that the scriptures of hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair proportional and not cruel
the hindu precept of cause no injury applies to animals and all life forms
this precept isn t found in the oldest verses of vedas bce but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas in post vedic period
in the oldest layer of the vedas such as the rigveda ritual sacrifices of animals and cooking of meat to feed guests are mentioned
this included goat ox horse and others or may be misinterpretation of verses
however the text is not uniform in the prescriptive sense
some verses praise meat as food while other verses in the vedas also recommend abstention from meat in particular beef
according to marvin harris the vedic literature is inconsistent with some verses suggesting ritual slaughter and meat consumption while others suggesting a taboo on meat eating
hindu texts dated to st millennium bc initially mention meat as food then evolve to suggestions that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten thereafter evolving to the stance that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers roots and fruits alone
the late vedic era literature pre bce condemns all killings of men cattle birds and horses and prays to god agni to punish those who kill
later texts of hinduism declare ahimsa one of the primary virtues declare any killing or harming any life as against dharma moral life
finally the discussion in upanishads and hindu epics shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate and if and how one may exert least harm to non human life consistent with ahimsa precept given the constraints of life and human needs
the mahabharata permits hunting by warriors but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non violent
sushruta samhita a hindu text written in the rd or th century in chapter xlvi suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women and the charaka samhita describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents
across the texts of hinduism there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of ahimsa when applied to non human life but without a universal consensus
alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant
even suggested exceptions ritual slaughter and hunting were challenged by advocates of ahimsa
in the mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints
moreover a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse
many of the arguments proposed in favor of non violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels the rewards it entails before or after death the danger and harm it prevents as well as to the karmic consequences of violence
the ancient hindu texts discuss ahimsa and non animal life
they discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants
hermits sannyasins were urged to live on a fruitarian diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants
scholars claim the principles of ecological nonviolence is innate in the hindu tradition and its conceptual fountain has been ahimsa as their cardinal virtue
the classical literature of the indian religions such as hinduism and jainism exists in many indian languages
for example the tirukkural written in three volumes likely between and ce dedicates verses and of its first volume to the virtue of ahimsa emphasizing on moral vegetarianism and non killing kollamai
however the tirukkural also glorifies soldiers and their valour during war and states that it is king s duty to punish criminals and implement death sentence for the wicked
in the th and th centuries prominent figures of indian spirituality such as shrimad rajchandra and swami vivekananda emphasised the importance of ahimsa
mohandas karamchand gandhi successfully promoted the principle of ahimsa to all spheres of life in particular to politics swaraj
his non violent resistance movement satyagraha had an immense impact on india impressed public opinion in western countries and influenced the leaders of various civil and political rights movements such as the american civil rights movement s martin luther king jr
and james bevel
in gandhi s thought ahimsa precludes not only the act of inflicting a physical injury but also mental states like evil thoughts and hatred unkind behavior such as harsh words dishonesty and lying all of which he saw as manifestations of violence incompatible with ahimsa
gandhi believed ahimsa to be a creative energy force encompassing all interactions leading one s self to find satya divine truth
sri aurobindo criticised the gandhian concept of ahimsa as unrealistic and not universally applicable he adopted a pragmatic non pacifist position saying that the justification of violence depends on the specific circumstances of the given situation
gandhi stated his belief that ahimsa is in hinduism it is in christianity as well as in islam he added nonviolence is common to all religions but it has found the highest expression and application in hinduism i do not regard jainism or buddhism as separate from hinduism when questioned whether violence and non violence is both taught in quran he stated i have heard it from many muslim friends that the koran teaches the use of non violence
the argument about non violence in the holy koran is an interpolation not necessary for my thesis
a historical and philosophical study of ahimsa was instrumental in the shaping of albert schweitzer s principle of reverence for life
schweitzer praised indian philosophical and religious traditions for the ethics of ahimsa the laying down of the commandment not to kill and not to damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of humankind but suggested that not killing and not harming is not always practically possible as in self defence nor ethical as in chronic starving during a famine case
ahimsa is imperative for practitioners of pata jali s eight limb raja yoga system
it is included in the first limb and is the first of five yamas self restraints which together with the second limb make up the code of ethical conduct in yoga philosophy
ahimsa is also one of the ten yamas in hatha yoga according to verse of its classic manual hatha yoga pradipika
the significance of ahimsa as the first restraint in the first limb of yoga yamas is that it defines the necessary foundation for progress through yoga
it is a precursor to asana implying that success in yogasana can be had only if the self is purified in thought word and deed through the self restraint of ahimsa
in jainism the understanding and implementation of ahims is more radical scrupulous and comprehensive than in any other religion
killing any living being out of passions is considered hi s to injure and abstaining from such an act is ahims noninjury
the vow of ahims is considered the foremost among the five vows of jainism
other vows like truth satya are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahims
in the practice of ahimsa the requirements are less strict for the lay persons sravakas who have undertaken anuvrata smaller vows than for the jain monastics who are bound by the mahavrata great vows
the statement ahims paramo dharma or non injury nonviolence harmlessness is the supreme ultimate paramount highest absolute duty virtue attribute religion slashes are used here to present alternative denotations is often found inscribed on the walls of the jain temples
like in hinduism the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma
when mahavira revived and reorganised the jain faith in the th or th century bce ahimsa was already an established strictly observed rule
rishabhanatha din tha the first jain tirthankara whom modern western historians consider to be a historical figure followed by parshvanatha p r van tha the twenty third tirthankara lived in about the th century bce
he founded the community to which mahavira s parents belonged
ahimsa was already part of the fourfold restraint caujjama the vows taken by parshva s followers
in the times of mahavira and in the following centuries jains were at odds with both buddhists and followers of the vedic religion or hindus whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of ahimsa
according to the jain tradition either lacto vegetarianism or veganism is prescribed
the jain concept of ahimsa is characterised by several aspects
killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out
jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible
though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants
jain monks and nuns go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals
both the renouncers and the laypeople of jain faith reject meat fish alcohol and honey as these are believed to harm large or minuscule life forms
jaina scholars have debated the potential injury to other life forms during one s occupation
certain jain texts states padmannabh jaini a jainism scholar forbid people of its faith from husbandry agriculture and trade in animal derived products
some jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals such as worms and insects these teachings in part have led the jain community to focus on trade merchant clerical and administrative occupations to minimize arambhaja himsa occupational violence against all life forms
for the layperson the teaching has been of ahimsa with pramada that is reducing violence through proper intention and being careful in every action on a daily basis to minimize violence to all life forms
the jain texts unlike most hindu and buddhist texts on just war have been inconsistent
for its monastic community sadhu and sadhvi the historically accepted practice has been to willingly sacrifice one s own life to the attacker to not retaliate so that the mendicant may keep the first great vow of total nonviolence
jain literature of the th century ce for example describes a king ready for war and being given lessons about non violence by the jain acharya spiritual teacher
in the th century ce and thereafter in an era of violent raids destruction of temples the slaughter of agrarian communities and ascetics by islamic armies jain scholars reconsidered the first great vow of mendicants and its parallel for the laypeople
the medieval texts of this era such as by jinadatta suri recommended both the mendicants and the laypeople to fight and kill if that would prevent greater and continued violence on humans and other life forms virodhi himsa
such exemptions to ahimsa is a relatively rare teaching in jain texts states dundas
mahatma gandhi stated no religion in the world has explained the principle of ahi s so deeply and systematically as is discussed with its applicability in every human life in jainism
as and when the benevolent principle of ahi s or non violence will be ascribed for practice by the people of the world to achieve their end of life in this world and beyond jainism is sure to have the uppermost status and mah v ra is sure to be respected as the greatest authority on ahi s
in buddhist texts ahimsa or its p li cognate avihi s is part of the five precepts pa cas la the first of which has been to abstain from killing
this precept of ahimsa is applicable to both the buddhist layperson and the monk community
the ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for laypersons but their power has been in the buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth
killing in buddhist belief could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk
saving animals from slaughter for meat is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth
these moral precepts have been voluntarily self enforced in lay buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth
the buddhist texts not only recommended ahimsa but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence
unlike lay buddhists transgressions by monks do invite sanctions
full expulsion of a monk from sangha follows instances of killing just like any other serious offense against the monastic nikaya code of conduct
violent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in buddhism but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged
the early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior
nonviolence is an overriding theme within the p li canon
while the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms and portray the ideal queen king as a pacifist such a queen king is nonetheless flanked by an army
it seems that the buddha s teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti military service way by early buddhists
the early texts assume war to be a fact of life and well skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare
in pali texts injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the sangha later mahayana texts which often generalise monastic norms to laity require this of lay people as well
the early texts do not contain just war ideology as such
some argue that a sutta in the gamani samyuttam rules out all military service
in this passage a soldier asks the buddha if it is true that as he has been told soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm
the buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth
in the early texts a person s mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth
some buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war
one example is the kosala samyutta in which king pasenadi a righteous king favored by the buddha learns of an impending attack on his kingdom
he arms himself in defence and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack
he lost this battle but won the war
king pasenadi eventually defeated king aj tasattu and captured him alive
he thought that although this king of magadha has transgressed against his kingdom he had not transgressed against him personally and aj tasattu was still his nephew
he released aj tasattu and did not harm him
upon his return the buddha said among other things that pasenadi is a friend of virtue acquainted with virtue intimate with virtue while the opposite is said of the aggressor king aj tasattu
according to theravada commentaries there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative
these are the presence of a living being human or animal the knowledge that the being is a living being the intent to kill the act of killing by some means and the resulting death
some buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated and its ethicization is predicated upon intent
some have argued that in defensive postures for example the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill but to defend against aggression and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions
according to dr
babasaheb ambedkar there is circumstantial evidence encouraging ahimsa from the buddha s doctrine love all so that you may not wish to kill any gautama buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule
he did not make ahimsa a matter of rule but suggested it as a matter of principle
this gives buddhists freedom to act
the emperors of the sui dynasty tang dynasty and early song dynasty banned killing in the lunar calendar s st th and th months
empress wu tse tien banned killing for more than half a year in
some rulers banned fishing for a period of time each year
there were also bans after the death of emperors after buddhist and taoist prayers and after natural disasters such as shanghai s summer drought as well as an day ban beginning august after the august flood the last big flood before the taiwan flood
people avoid killing during some festivals like the taoist ghost festival the nine emperor gods festival and the vegetarian festival as well as during others
the idea of veganism or moral vegetarianism is linked to ahimsa
jay dinshah founded the american vegan society avs linking veganism to the concept of ahimsa
