iranian history has had a significant impact on the world through art architecture poetry science and technology medicine philosophy and engineering
an eclectic cultural elasticity has been said to be one of the key defining characteristics of the iranian identity and a clue to its historical longevity
richard n
frye a prominent iranologist stresses the high level historical impact of iranian culture in his book greater iran a th century odyssey
iran s glory has always been its culture furthermore iran s culture has manifested itself in several facets throughout the history of the iranian plateau as well as of the south caucasus central asia anatolia and mesopotamia
iran has one of the oldest richest and most influential art heritages in the world which encompasses many disciplines including literature music dance architecture painting weaving pottery calligraphy metalworking and stonemasonry
iranian art has gone through numerous phases which is evident from the unique aesthetics of iran
from the elamite chogha zanbil to the median and achaemenid reliefs of persepolis to the mosaics of bishapur
the islamic golden age brought drastic changes to the styles and practice of the arts
however each iranian dynasty had its own particular foci building upon the previous dynasty s all of which during their times were heavily influential in shaping the cultures of the world then and today
several languages are spoken throughout iran
languages from the iranian turkic and semitic language families are spoken across iran
according to the cia factbook of iranians speaks an iranian language as their native tongue speak a turkic language as their native tongue and speak a semitic language as their native tongue while the remaining speak languages from various other groups
although the azerbaijanis speak a turkic language due to their culture history and genetics they are often associated with the iranian peoples
the predominant language and national language of iran is persian which is spoken fluently across the country
azerbaijani is spoken primarily and widely in the northwest kurdish and luri are spoken primarily in the west mazandarani and gilaki spoken in the regions along the caspian sea arabic primarily in the persian gulf coastal regions balochi primarily in the southeast and turkmen primarily in northern border regions

ethnologue estimates that there are iranian languages the largest among them being persian pashto and the kurdish dialect continuum with an estimated million native speakers of the iranian languages worldwide
dialects of persian are sporadically spoken throughout the region from china to syria to russia though mainly in the iranian plateau
the literature of iran is one of the world s oldest and most celebrated literatures spanning over years from the many achaemenid inscriptions such as the behistun inscription to the celebrated iranian poets of the islamic golden age and modern iran
iranian literature has been described as one of the great literature s of humanity and one of the four main bodies of world literature
distinguished professor l p
elwell sutton described the literature of the persian language as one of the richest poetic literatures of the world
very few literary works of pre islamic iran have survived due partly to the destruction of the libraries of persepolis by alexander of macedon during the era of the achaemenids and subsequent invasion of iran by the arabs in who sought to eradicate all non quranic texts
this resulted in all iranian libraries being destroyed books either being burnt or thrown into rivers
the only way that iranians could protect these books was to bury them but many of the texts were forgotten over time
as soon as circumstances permitted the iranians wrote books and assembled libraries
iranian literature encompasses a variety of literature in the languages used in iran
modern iranian literature includes persian literature azerbaijani literature kurdish literature and the literature of the remaining minority languages
persian is the predominant and official language of iran and throughout iran s history it has been the nation s most influential literary language
the persian language has been often dubbed as the most worthy language of the world to serve as a conduit for poetry
azerbaijani literature has also had a profound effect on iran s literature with it being developed highly after iran s first reunification in years under the safavid empire whose rulers themselves wrote poetry
there remain a few literary works of the extinct iranian language of old azeri that was used in azerbaijan prior to the linguistic turkification of the people of the region
kurdish literature has also had a profound impact on the literature of iran with it incorporating the various kurdish dialects that are spoken throughout the middle east
the earliest works of kurdish literature are those of the th century poet malaye jaziri
some notable greats of iranian poetry which have had major global influence include the likes of ferdowsi sa di hafiz attar nezami rumi and omar khayyam
these poets have inspired the likes of goethe ralph waldo emerson and many others
contemporary iranian literature has been influenced by classical persian poetry but also reflects the particularities of modern day iran through writers such as houshang moradi kermani the most translated modern iranian author and poet ahmad shamlou
iranian music has directly influenced the cultures of west asia central asia europe and south asia
it has mainly influenced and built up much of the musical terminology of the neighboring turkic and arabic cultures and reached india through the th century persianate mughal empire whose court promoted new musical forms by bringing iranian musicians
iran is the place of origin of complex instruments with the instruments dating back to the third millennium bc
a number of trumpets made of silver gold and copper were found in eastern iran that are attributed to the oxus civilization and date back between and bc
the use of both vertical and horizontal angular harps have been documented at the archaeological sites of madaktu bc and kul e fara bc with the largest collection of elamite instruments documented at kul e fara
multiple depictions of horizontal harps were also sculpted in assyrian palaces dating back between and bc
the reign of sassanian ruler khosrow ii is regarded as a golden age for iranian music
sassanid music is where many the many music cultures of the world trace their distant origins to
the court of khosrow ii hosted a number of prominent musicians including azad bamshad barbad nagisa ramtin and sarkash
among these attested names barbad is remembered in many documents and has been named as remarkably high skilled
he was a poet musician who developed modal music may have invented the lute and the musical tradition that was to transform into the forms of dastgah and maqam
he has been credited to have organized a musical system consisting of seven royal modes xosrov ni derived modes nav and melodies d st n
the academic classical music of iran in addition to preserving melody types that are often attributed to sassanian musicians is based on the theories of sonic aesthetics as expounded by the likes of iranian musical theorists in the early centuries of after the muslim conquest of the sasanian empire most notably avicenna farabi qotb ed din shirazi and safi ed din urmawi
iran has a rich and ancient dance culture which extends to the sixth millennium bc
dances from ancient artifacts excavated at the archaeological pre historic sites of iran portray a vibrant culture that mixes different forms of dances for all occasions
in conjunction with music the artifacts depicted actors dancers and ordinary people dancing in plays dramas celebrations mourning and religious rituals with equipment such as costumes of animals or plants masks and surrounding objects
as time progressed this culture of dance began to develop and flourish
iran is a multi ethnic nation
although the cultures of its ethnic groups are very similar and in most areas near identical each has their own distinct and specific dance style
iran possesses four categories of dance with these being group dances solo improvisational dance war or combat dances and spiritual dances
typically the group dances are often unique and named after the region or the ethnic groups with which they are associated with
these dances can be chain dances involving a group or the more common group dances mainly performed at festive occasions like weddings and noruz celebrations which focus less on communal line or circle dances and more on solo improvisational forms with each dancer interpreting the music in her own special way but within a specific range of dance vocabulary sometimes blending other dance styles or elements
solo dances are usually reconstructions of the historical and court dances of the various iranian dynasties throughout history with the most common types being that of the safavid and qajar dynasties due to them being relatively newer
these often are improvisational dances and utilize delicate graceful movements of the hands and arms such as wrist circles
war or combat dances imitate combat or help to train the warrior
it could be argued that men from the zurkhaneh house of strength and their ritualized wrestling training movements are known as a type of dance called raghs e pa with the dances and actions done in the zurkhaneh also resembling that of a martial art
spiritual dances in iran are known as sama
there are various types of these spiritual dances which are used for spiritual purposes such as ridding the body of ill omens and evil spirits
these dances involve trance music and complex movements
an example of such dance is that of the balochi s called le b gowati which is performed to rid a supposedly possessed person of the possessing spirit
in the balochi language the term gowati refers to psychologically ill patients who have recovered through music and dance
the earliest researched dances from iran is a dance worshiping mithra the zoroastrian angelic divinity of covenant light and oath which was used commonly by the roman cult of mithra
one of the cult s ceremonies involved the sacrifice of a bull followed by a dance that promoted vigor in life
the cult of mithra were active from the st century ce to the th century ce and worshiped a mystery religion inspired by the iranian worship of mithra
it was a rival of christianity in the roman empire and was eventually suppressed in the th century ce by roman authorities in favor of christianity
this was done in order to counter the greater iranian cultural influence that was expanding throughout the roman empire
the cult was highly adhered and respected throughout the roman empire with it center in rome and was popular throughout the western half of the empire as far south as roman africa and numidia as far north as roman britain and to a lesser extent in roman syria in the east
the history of iranian architecture dates back to at least bc with characteristic examples distributed over a vast area from turkey and iraq to uzbekistan and tajikistan to the south caucasus and zanzibar
currently there are unesco designated world heritage sites that were designed and constructed by iranians with of them being located outside of iran
iranian architecture displays a great variety of both structure and aesthetics and despite the repeated trauma of destructive invasions and cultural shocks the iranian zeal and identity has always triumphed and flourished
in turn it has greatly influenced the architecture of its invaders from the greeks to the arabs to the turks
the traditional theme of iranian architecture is cosmic symbolism which depicts the communication and participation of man with the powers of heaven
this theme has not only given continuity and longevity to the architecture of iran but has been a primary source of its emotional character of the nation as well
iranian architecture ranges from simple structures to some of the most majestic structures the world has ever seen
iranian architectural style is the combination of intensity and simplicity to form immediacy while ornament and often subtle proportions reward sustained observation
iranian architecture makes use of abundant symbolic geometry using pure forms such as the circle and square and plans are based on often symmetrical layouts featuring rectangular courtyards and halls
the paramount virtues of iranian architecture are a marked feeling for form and scale structural inventiveness especially in vault and dome construction a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture
the traditional architecture of iran throughout the ages is categorized into families and six following classes or styles
the two categories are zoroastrian and islamic which references the eras of pre islamic and post islamic iran and the six styles in order of their era are parsian parthian khorasani razi azari esfahani
the pre islamic styles draw on to years of architectural development from the various civilizations of the iranian plateau
the post islamic architecture of iran in turn draws ideas from its pre islamic predecessor and has geometrical and repetitive forms as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles carved stucco patterned brickwork floral motifs and calligraphy
in addition to historic gates palaces bridges buildings and religious sites which highlight the highly developed supremacy of the iranian art of architecture iranian gardens are also an example of iran s comic symbolism and unique style of combining intensity and simplicity for form immediacy
there are currently iranian gardens that are listed as unesco world heritage sites with of them being located outside of iran
the traditional style of iranian gardens are to represent an earthly paradise or a heaven on earth
from the time of the achaemenid empire the idea of an earthly paradise spread through iranian literature to other cultures with the word for paradise in the iranian languages of avestan old persian and median spreading to languages across the world
the style and design of the iranian garden greatly influenced the garden styles of countries from spain to italy and greece to india with some notable examples of such gardens being the gardens of the alhambra in spain humayun s tomb and the taj mahal in india the hellenistic gardens of the seleucid empire and the ptolemies in alexandria
zoroastrianism was the national faith of iran for more than a millennium before the arab conquest
it has had an immense influence on iranian philosophy culture and art after the people of iran converted to islam
the persian samanid dynasty made great attempts spread the islamic faith in the th and th century while promoting a persian cultural revival
until the th century iran was majority sunni ushering a golden age of the arts and sciences
in the safavid dynasty took control of iran and made shia islam the state religion with this being one of the most important events in islamic history
today of the of muslims living in iran around are shi a and only around are sunni
this is quite the opposite trend of the percentage distribution of shi a to sunni islam followers in the rest of the muslim population from state to state primarily in the middle east and throughout the rest of the world
followers of the bah faith form the largest non muslim minority in iran
bah s are scattered throughout small communities in iran although there seems to be a large population of bah s in tehran
the iranian government actively pursues the persecution of bah s
followers of the christian faith consist of around armenians around assyrians and a small number of roman catholic anglican and protestant iranians that have been converted by missionaries in earlier centuries
thus christians that live in iran are primarily descendants of indigenous christians that were converted during the th and th centuries
judaism is an officially recognized faith in iran and in spite of the hostilities between iran and israel over the palestinian issue the millennia old jewish community in iran enjoys the right to practice their religion freely as well as a dedicated seat in parliament to a representative member of their faith
in addition to christianity and judaism zoroastrianism is another officially recognized religion in iran although followers of this faith do not hold a large population in iran
in addition although there have been isolated incidences of prejudice against zoroastrians most followers of this faith have not been persecuted for being followers of this faith
the persian year begins in the vernal equinox if the astronomical vernal equinox comes before noon then the present day is the first day of the persian year
if the equinox falls after noon then the next day is the official first day of the persian year

there are two stages in a typical wedding ritual in iran
usually both phases take place in one day
the first stage is known as aghd which is basically the legal component of marriage in iran
in this process the bride and groom as well as their respective guardians sign a marriage contract
this phase usually takes place in the bride s home
after this legal process is over the second phase jashn e aroosi takes place
in this step which is basically the wedding reception where actual feasts and celebrations are held typically lasts from about days
the ceremony takes place in a decorated room with flowers and a beautifully decorated spread on the floor
this spread is typically passed down from mother to daughter and is composed of very nice fabric such as termeh cashmere atlas gold embroidered satin or abrisham silk
items are placed on this spread a mirror of fate two candelabras representing the bride and groom and their bright future a tray of seven multi colored herbs and spices including poppy seeds wild rice angelica salt nigella seeds black tea and frankincense
these herbs and spices play specific roles ranging from breaking spells and witchcraft to blinding the evil eye to burning evil spirits
in addition to these herbs spices a special baked and decorated flatbread a basket of decorated eggs decorated almonds walnuts and hazelnuts in their shell to represent fertility a basket of pomegranates apples for a joyous future as these fruits are considered divine a cup of rose water from special persian roses which helps perfume the air a bowl made out of sugar apparently to sweeten life for the newlywed couple and a brazier holding burning coals and sprinkled with wild rue as a way to keep the evil eye away and to purify the wedding ritual are placed on the spread as well
finally there are additional items that must be placed on the spread including a bowl of gold coins to represent wealth and prosperity a scarf shawl made of silk fine fabric to be held over the bride and groom s head at certain points in the ceremony two sugar cones which are ground above the bride and groom s head thus symbolizing sweetness happiness a cup of honey to sweeten life a needle and seven strands of colored thread the shawl that is held above the bride and groom s head is sewn together with the string throughout the ceremony and a copy of the couple s holy book other religions require different texts but all of these books symbolize god s blessing for the couple
an early age in marriage especially for brides is a long documented feature of marriage in iran
while the people of iran have been trying to legally change this practice by implementing a higher minimum in marriage there have been countless blocks to such an attempt
although the average age of women being married has increased by about five years in the past couple decades young girls being married is still common feature of marriage in iran even though there is an article in the iranian civil code that forbid the marriage of women younger than years of age and males younger than years of age
in iran persian rugs have always been a vital part of the persian culture
iranians were some of the first people in history to weave carpets
first deriving from the notion of basic need the persian rug started out as a simple pure weave of fabric that helped nomadic people living in ancient iran stay warm from the cold damp ground
as time progressed the complexity and beauty of rugs increased to a point where rugs are now bought as decorative pieces
because of the long history of fine silk and wool rug weaving in iran persian rugs are world renowned as some of the most beautiful intricately designed rugs available
around various places in iran rugs seem to be some of the most prized possessions of the local people
iran currently produces more rugs and carpets than all other countries in the world put together

in the words of iranologist richard nelson frye
many times i have emphasized that the present peoples of central asia whether iranian or turkic speaking have one culture one religion one set of social values and traditions with only language separating them the culture of persia has thus developed over several thousand years
but historically the peoples of what are now iran armenia azerbaijan turkey uzbekistan tajikistan turkmenistan eastern georgia and afghanistan are related to one another as part of the larger group of peoples of the greater iranian cultural and historical sphere
the northern caucasus is well within the sphere of influence of persian culture as well as can be seen from the many remaining relics ruins and works of literature from that region e g
