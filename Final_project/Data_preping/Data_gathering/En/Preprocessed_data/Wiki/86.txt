dyssemia is a difficulty with receptive and or expressive nonverbal communication
the word comes from the greek roots dys difficulty and semia signal
the term was coined by psychologists marshall duke and stephen nowicki in their book helping the child who doesn t fit in to decipher the hidden dimensions of social rejection
these difficulties go beyond problems with body language and motor skills
dyssemic persons exhibit difficulties with the acquisition and use of nonverbal cues in interpersonal relationships
a classic set of studies by albert mehrabian showed that in face to face interactions percent of the emotional meaning of a message is expressed through facial postural and gestural means and percent of the emotional meaning is transmitted through the tone of voice
only seven percent of the emotional meaning is actually expressed with words dyssemia represents the social dysfunction aspect of nonverbal learning disorder
the social interactions of dyssemic adults tend to be immature and complex even though their non relational reasoning ranges from normal to gifted
dyssemic individuals exhibit varying degrees of social awkwardness and various types of nonverbal communication difficulties
some might only have trouble with reception or expression alone while others struggle with both
severity fluctuates among individuals difficulty does not necessarily equate to total inability nor occur in all situations
occasionally expressive difficulty may only be a delay between the emotion and the facial muscles
socially awkward adults suffering from nonverbal shortcomings often report feeling a little out of it socially or feeling left out
dyssemic adults frequently experience success in temporary or accidental situations but their sense of success can be short lived returning to an often common pattern of disappointment and self reproach
many times dyssemic individuals may say something in a way they had not intended and worry about the consequences
dyssemic adults may sometimes struggle with interpreting the feelings or social interests of new acquaintances causing potential resentment and or rejection
they also may have difficulty with subtler aspects of social interaction for example timing and opportunity
this may aggravate the situation baffling acquaintances coworkers and even relatives
dyssemic individuals may also become targets of adult bullies
if dyssemic adults are in an environment or situation with adequate verbal input or other cues however they have a frame for understanding or constructing appropriate responses and these problems can be greatly reduced
there is presently little research on adults with dyssemia nld compared to the research on children making it difficult to treat medically
until more adults are included in the research on diagnosis and treatment misperceptions may occur and their quality of life may deteriorate over time into loneliness isolation anger and even aggression as a result of a lack of understanding on the part of both populations
however it may be treated socially to some extent
through intense observation or asking questions as of a supportive friend or colleague the individual with dyssemia can often eventually pass in most situations once he or she has learned the typical gestures for a given situation
since many adults with dyssemia or nld are quite competent in reading or writing it is often helpful to clarify one s communication using fully worded sentences or supplementing gestures or facial expressions with a verbal clue as to meaning
social anxiety or social phobia are medical classifications that can be used to designate nonverbal communication problems however dyssemia is not an anxiety or phobia when it applies to nld or specific brain damage for example to the right hemisphere
chronic dyssemia is a condition that some neurologists term social emotional processing disorder sepd
dyssemia is considered a difference rather than a disability as such it is not classified as a standard medical condition
many times dyssemia springs from cultural differences other times dyssemia constitutes an offshoot of attention deficit disorder add
however the differences can be devastating
problems associated with dyssemia in the establishment and maintenance of interpersonal relationships are often at the root of people s social and occupational troubles
sometimes persons affected with mild autism spectrum disorder asd or social anxiety disorder also struggle with characteristics of dyssemia
dyssemia can be remediated through a variety of programs designed to assess its presence and alter its adverse impact
such programs not unlike acculturation emphasize virtual and social learning
