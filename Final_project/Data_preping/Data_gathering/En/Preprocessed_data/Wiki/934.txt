saint pantaenus the philosopher greek died c
was a greek theologian and a significant figure in the catechetical school of alexandria from around ad
this school was the earliest catechetical school and became influential in the development of christian theology
pantaenus was a stoic philosopher teaching in alexandria
he was a native of sicily
he converted to the christian faith and sought to reconcile his new faith with greek philosophy
his most famous student clement who was his successor as head of the catechetical school described pantaenus as the sicilian bee
although no writings by pantaenus are extant his legacy is known by the influence of the catechetical school on the development of christian theology in particular in the early debates on the interpretation of the bible the trinity and christology
he was the main supporter of serapion of antioch for acting against the influence of gnosticism
in addition to his work as a teacher eusebius of caesarea reports that pantaenus was for a time a missionary traveling as far as india where according to eusebius he found christian communities using the gospel of matthew written in hebrew letters supposedly left them by the apostle bartholomew and which might have been the gospel of the hebrews
this may indicate that syrian christians using a syriac version of the new testament had already evangelized parts of india by the late nd century
however some writers have suggested that having difficulty with the language of saint thomas christians pantaenus misinterpreted their reference to mar thoma the aramaic term meaning saint thomas who is currently credited with bringing christianity to india in the st century by the syrian churches as bar tolmai the hebrew name of bartholomew
the ancient seaport muziris on the malabar coast modern day kerala in india was frequented by the egyptians in the early centuries ad
saint jerome c
september apparently relying entirely on eusebius evidence from historia ecclesiastica wrote that pantaenus visited india to preach christ to the brahmans and philosophers there it is unlikely that jerome has any information about pantaenus mission to india that is independent of eusebius
on the other hand his claim that many of pantaenus biblical commentaries were still extant is probably based on jerome s own knowledge
his feast day as july
the coptic synaxarium mentions pantaenus and clement in its entry regarding the return of the relics of st mark the apostle by pope paul vi of rome on paoni but does not assign pantaenus any specific feast date
the universalist church of america historian j
hanson argued that pantaenus must beyond question have taught universalism to clement of alexandria and origen
however since it is now considered that clement of alexandria s views contained a tension between salvation and freewill and that he and origen did not clearly teach universal reconciliation of all immortal souls in their understanding of apokatastasis hanson s conclusion about pantaenus lacks a firm basis
