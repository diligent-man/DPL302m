Haas's style recalls that of György Ligeti in its use of micropolyphony microintervals and the exploitation of the overtone series he is often characterized as a leading exponent of spectral music His aesthetics is guided by the idea that music is able to articulate a human being's emotions and states of the soul in such a way that other human beings can embrace these emotions and states of the soul as their own Emotionen und seelische Zustände von Menschen so zu formulieren daß sie auch von anderen Menschen als die ihren angenommen werden können Thus Haas has disavowed the intellectualism of some strands of the modernist musical avant garde such as serialism and deconstructivism The emotional atmosphere of many of his works is sombre Haas's operas have been criticized for evoking themes like suffering illness and death to aesthetic voyeurism the piece Haas's opera Thomas comes dangerously close to a kind of palliative care ward tourism
In a similar vein his orchestral works have been compared to film music Dark dreams for symphony orchestra lets us think of a soundtrack ready made for a suspense movie lässt aber auch an einen probaten Soundtrack zum Suspense Streifen denken
