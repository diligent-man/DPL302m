Early international games were played against the Netherlands Germany and France
The bandy team represented England in the European Bandy Championships in Davos Switzerland
It was credited with winning the eight-nation tournament
At the time bandy in England was administrated through the National Bandy Association
The societal upheavals due to World War I then ended the interest for bandy in Britain
After almost a hundred years a new national federation for bandy was formed
The Bandy Federation of England joined the Federation of International Bandy in and England aimed to play in the World Championships in the coming years
The federation changed names to England Bandy Federation in January and to Great Britain Bandy Association in September
The Great Britain national bandy team made its debut at the Bandy World Championship in Sweden and managed to become runners-up in the B Division in its dbut championship tournament but could not attend the World Championship in Russia due to problems getting visas for the players
