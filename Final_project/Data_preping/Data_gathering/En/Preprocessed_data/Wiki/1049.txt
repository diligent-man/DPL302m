Oncology is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention diagnosis and treatment of cancer A medical professional who practices oncology is called an Oncologist
Cancer survival has improved due to three main components improved prevention efforts to reduce exposure to risk factors e g tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption improved screening of several cancers allowing for earlier diagnosis and improvements in treatment
Cancers are often managed through discussion on multi disciplinary cancer conferences where medical oncologists surgical oncologists radiation oncologists pathologists radiologists and organ specific oncologists meet to find the best possible management for an individual patient considering the physical social psychological emotional and financial status of the patient It is very important for oncologists to keep up to date with the latest advancements in oncology as changes in the management of cancer are quite common
Because a cancer diagnosis can cause distress and anxiety clinicians may use a number of strategies such as SPIKES for offering emotional support
The name's etymological origin is the Greek word ngkos meaning burden volume mass and barb and the Greek word logos meaning study The neoclassical term oncology was used from initially in neo Greek in cognizance of Galen's work on abnormal tumors De tumoribus pr ter naturam
Tobacco exposure is the leading cause of cancer and death from it Smoking tobacco is associated with increased risk of death of over varieties of cancer including lung larynx mouth esophagus throat brain bladder kidney liver stomach pancreas colon rectum cervix ovary urinary bladder prostate head and neck brain and blood Smokeless tobacco snuff or chewing tobacco is associated with increased risks of cancers of the mouth esophagus and pancreas Alcohol
Alcohol consumption increases risk of cancers of the mouth throat esophagus larynx liver and breast The risk of cancer is much higher for those who drink alcohol and also use tobacco Obesity
Obese individuals have an increased risk of cancer of the breast colon rectum endometrium esophagus kidney pancreas and gallbladder
Advanced age is a risk factor for many cancers The median age of cancer diagnosis is years Cancer Causing Substances
Cancer is caused by changes to certain genes that alter the way our cells function Some of them are the result of environmental exposures that damage DNA These exposures may include substances such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke or radiation such as ultraviolet rays from the sun and other carcinogens
Certain infectious agents including oncoviruses bacteria and parasites can cause cancer
The body's immune response plays a role in defending the body against cancer a concept known mainly because certain cancers occur at a greatly increased prevalence among people with immunosuppression Cancer screening is recommended for cancers of breast cervix colon and lung
Signs and symptoms usually depend on the size and type of cancer
Lump in breast and axilla associated with or without ulceration or bloody nipple discharge

Computational oncology An example is PRIMAGE This four year EU funded Horizon project was launched in December The project proposes a cloud based platform to support decision making in the clinical management of malignant solid tumours offering predictive tools to assist diagnosis prognosis therapies choice and treatment follow up based on the use of novel imaging biomarkers in silico tumour growth simulation advanced visualisation of predictions with weighted confidence scores and machine learning based translation of this knowledge into predictors for the most relevant disease specific Clinical End Points Leukemia Lymphoma Germ cell tumors and early stage solid tumors which were once incurable have become curable malignancies now Immunotherapies have already proven efficient in leukemia bladder cancer and various skin cancer For the future research is promising in the field of physical oncology
Survival of cancer has significantly improved over the past years due to improved screening diagnostic methods and treatment options with targeted therapy
Large multi centric Phase III randomised controlled clinical trials by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Bowel Project NSABP Medical Research Council MRC the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer EORTC and National Cancer Institute NCI have contributed significantly to the improvement in survival Watson Ian R Takahashi Koichi Futreal P Andrew Chin Lynda Emerging patterns of somatic mutations in cancer Nat Rev Genet doi nrg PMC PMID
