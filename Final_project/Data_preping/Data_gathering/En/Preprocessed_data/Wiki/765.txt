the history of turkmenistan traditionally began with the arrival of indo european iranian tribes around bc
early tribes were nomadic or semi nomadic due to the arid conditions of the region that prevented widespread adoption of agriculture and the steppe culture in central asia was an extension of a larger eurasian series of horse cultures which spanned the entire spectrum of language families including the indo europeans and turko mongol groups
some of the known early iranian tribes included the massagatae the scythians sakas and early soghdians who were most likely precursors of the khwarezmians
turkmenistan was a passing point for numerous migrations and invasions by tribes which gravitated towards the settled regions of the south including ancient mesopotamia elam and the indus valley civilization
the region s written history begins with the region s conquest by the achaemenid empire of ancient iran as the region was divided between the satraps of margiana chorasmia and parthia
later conquerors included alexander the great the parni ephthalites iranian huns g kt rks sarmatians and sassanid iranians
during this early phase of history the majority of turkmenistan s inhabitants were adherents of zoroastrianism and buddhism and the region was largely dominated by iranian peoples
these incursions and epochs though pivotal did not shape the region s history as the invasions of two later invading groups arabs and the oghuz turks
the vast majority of inhabitants were converted to hanifism while the oghuz brought the beginnings of the turkic turkmen language that came to dominate the area
the turkic period was a time of cultural fusion and growth as islamic traditions brought by the arabs merged with local iranian cultures and the city of merv became a centre of commerce science and innovation being an influential capital of several islamic caliphates
the cultural landscape of turkmenistan was further altered by turkic invaders and rulers such as the seljuks
genghis khan and mongol invasions devastated the region during the late middle ages but their hold upon the area was transitional as timur leng and uzbeks later contested the land
modern turkmenistan was radically transformed by the invasion of the russian empire which conquered and annexed the region in the late th century
later the russian revolution of would ultimately transform turkmenistan from an islamic and nomadic tribal society to a industrialized and urbanist leninist socialist republic during the soviet era
independence came in as saparmurat niyazov a former member of the local branch of the cpsu declared himself the absolute president for life taking up the title turkmenbashi also known as the leader of the turkmen and transformed the newly independent turkmenistan into an totalitarian conservative dictatorship under his absolute rule
turkmenistan has thus far been unable to significantly democratize itself unlike most of the other former soviet republics and niyazov ruled the country until his death on december
he was succeeded by gurbanguly berdimuhamedow in an election devoid of meaningful political competition and opposition and berdymuhamedow reversed many policies by niyazov that were considered eccentric including niyazov s pervasive cult of personality and the country s near total international and socioeconomic isolation passing several economic reforms and making limited moves towards a multi party system although each party represented in the legislative body was under the regime s direct oversight and open dissent against the government still faced widespread repression
gurbanguly berdimuhamedow was later succeeded by his son serdar berdimuhamedow after he stepped down from political office in march establishing a de facto political dynasty
scant remains point to early human settlements east of the caspian sea possibly including neanderthals although the archaeology of the region as a whole is underresearched
bronze age and iron age finds support the probability of advanced civilizations in the area including finds associated with a society known to scholars as the bactria margiana archaeological complex bmac near the modern cities of mary previously merv djeitun and gonur tepe
by bce indo european peoples had settled throughout the region
most of the present day turkmenistan was occupied by bmac related societies and the dahae also known as the daae dah daoi and similar names a tribal confederation located immediately east of the caspian
the massagetae and scythians were also present immediately north of bmac and the dahae
alexander the great conquered the territory in the th century bc on his way to south asia
in bc alexander marched northward into central asia and founded the city of alexandria near the murghab river
located on an important trade route alexandria later became the city of merv
the ruins of alexander s ancient city are still to be found and have been extensively researched
after alexander s death his empire quickly fell apart
it was ruled by seleucids before the satrap of parthia declared independence
the parthians fierce nomadic warriors from the north of iran then established the kingdom of parthia which covered present day turkmenistan and iran
the parthian kings ruled their domain from the city of nisa an area now located near the modern day capital of ashgabat founded by arsaces i reigned c
bc and was reputedly the royal necropolis of the parthian kings although it has neither been established that the fortress at nisa was a royal residence nor a mausoleum
excavations at nisa have revealed substantial buildings mausoleums and shrines many inscribed documents and a looted treasury
many hellenistic art works have been uncovered as well as a large number of ivory rhytons the outer rims decorated with iranian subjects or classical mythological scenes
during the th to early th century ce much of the population was already in settlements around the fertile river valleys along the amu darya and merv and nisa became centers of sericulture the raising of silkworms
a busy caravan route connecting tang dynasty china and the city of baghdad in modern iraq passed through merv
thus the city of merv constituted an important prize for any conqueror
central asia came under arab control after a series of invasions in the late th and early th centuries and was incorporated into islamic caliphate divided between provinces of mawara un nahr and khorasan
the arab conquest brought the religion of islam to all of the peoples of central asia
the city of merv was occupied by the lieutenants of the caliph uthman ibn affan and was constituted as the capital of khorasan
using this city as their base the arabs led by their commander qutayba ibn muslim brought under subjection balkh bokhara fergana and kashgaria and penetrated into china as far as the province of kan suh early in the th century
merv achieved some political spotlight in february when abu muslim d
declared a new abbasid dynasty at merv and set out from the city to conquer iran and iraq and establish a new capital at baghdad
abu muslim was famously challenged by the goldsmith of merv to do the right thing and not make war on fellow muslims
the goldsmith was put to death
in the latter part of the th century merv became obnoxious to islam as the centre of heretical propaganda preached by al muqanna the veiled prophet of khorasan
present turkmenistan was ruled by tahirids between and
in arab rule in central asia came to an end as a result of the saffarid conquest
during their dominion merv like samarkand and bokhara was one of the great schools of learning and the celebrated historian yaqut studied in its libraries
merv produced a number of scholars in various branches of knowledge such as islamic law hadith history literature and the like
several scholars have the name marwazi designating them as hailing from merv
but saffarid rule was brief and they were defeated by samanids in
the samanid dynasty weakened after second half of th century and ghaznavids took present turkmenistan in s
but they challenged with seljuks newcomers from north
seljuks decisive victory against them present turkmenistan was passed to them in
the origins of the turkmen may be traced back to the oghuz confederation of nomadic pastoral tribes of the early middle ages who lived in present day mongolia and around lake baikal in present day southern siberia
this confederation was composed of turkic speaking peoples who formed the basis of powerful steppe empires in inner asia
in the second half of the th century oghuz components migrated through jungaria into central asia and arabic sources located them under the term guzz in the area of the middle and lower syrdariya in the th century
by the th century the oghuz had expanded west and north of the aral sea and into the steppe of present day kazakhstan absorbing not only iranians but also turks from the kipchak and karluk ethnolinguistic groups
in the th century the renowned muslim turk scholar mahmud al kashgari described the language of the oghuz and turkmen as distinct from that of other turks and identified twenty two oghuz clans or sub tribes some of which appear in later turkmen genealogies and legends as the core of the early turkmen
in old turkic inscriptions there are references to several oghuz groups like simply oghuz oghuz three oghuz possibly karluks alt oghuz six oghuz sekiz oghuz eight oghuz possibly otuz oghuz thirty oghuz and the tiele affiliated toquz oghuz nine oghuz chinese jiu xing nine surnames in different areas in the vicinity of the altay mountains
despite the similarity of names the toquz oghuz confederation from whom emerged the founders of the uyghur khaganate was distinct from the transoxanian oghuz turks who d later found the oghuz yabgu state for instances istakhri and muhammad ibn muhmad al tusi kept the toquz oghuz and oghuz distinct and ibn al faqih mentioned the infidel turk oghuz the toquz oghuz and the qarluq even so golden notes the confusion in latter g kt rks and uyghurs inscriptions where oghuz apparently referred to toquz oghuz or another tribal grouping who were also named oghuz without a prefixed numeral this confusion is also reflected in sharaf al zaman al marwazi who listed oghuz tribes who were ruled by a toquz khaqan and some of whom were toquz oghuz on the border of transoxiana and khwarazm
at most the oghuz were possibly led by a core group of toquz oghuz clans or tribes
likewise karluks and oghuz turks were distinct even though both were known as turkmens in the th century yet much later ilkhanate politician rashid al din hamadani in his jami al tawarikh mentions karluks as of the oghuz turkmen tribes
oghuz expansion by means of military campaigns went at least as far as the volga river and ural mountains but the geographic limits of their dominance fluctuated in the steppe areas extending north and west from the aral sea
accounts of arab geographers and travelers portray the oghuz ethnic group as lacking centralized authority and being governed by a number of kings and chieftains because of their disparate nature as a polity and the vastness of their domains oghuz tribes rarely acted in concert
hence by the late th century the bonds of their confederation began to loosen
at that time a clan leader named seljuk founded a dynasty and the empire that bore his name on the basis of those oghuz elements that had migrated southward into present day turkmenistan and iran
the seljuk empire was centered in persia from which oghuz groups spread into azerbaijan and anatolia
after the fall of g kt rk kingdom oghuz tribes migrated to the area of transoxiana in western turkestan in modern kazakhstan and kirghizstan
this land became known as the oghuz steppe which is an area between the caspian and aral seas
ibn al athir an arab historian stated that the oghuz turks had come to transoxiana in the period of the caliph al mahdi in the years between and
in the period of the abbasid caliph al ma mun the name oghuz starts to appear in the islamic historiography
by ad the eastern parts of the syr darya were ruled by the karluk turks and the western region oghuz steppe was ruled by the oghuz turks
the name turkmen first appears in written sources of the th century to distinguish those oghuz groups who migrated south into the seljuk domains and accepted islam from those that had remained in the steppe
gradually the term took on the properties of an ethnonym and was used exclusively to designate muslim oghuz especially those who migrated away from the syrdariya basin
by the th century the term turkmen supplanted the designation oghuz altogether
the origin of the word turkmen remains unclear
according to popular etymologies as old as the th century the word derives from turk plus the iranian element manand and means resembling a turk modern scholars on the other hand have proposed that the element man men acts as an intensifier and have translated the word as pure turk or most turk like of the turks
in the th century seljuk domains stretched from the delta of the amu darya delta into iran iraq the caucasus region syria and asia minor
in the seljuk turks crossed the oxus from the north and having defeated masud sultan of ghazni raised toghrul beg grandson of seljuk to the throne of iran founding the seljukid dynasty with its capital at nishapur
a younger brother of toghrul daud took possession of merv and herat
toghrul was succeeded by his nephew alp arslan the great lion who was buried at merv
it was about this time that merv reached the zenith of her glory
in seljuk forces entered baghdad becoming masters of the islamic heartlands and important patrons of islamic institutions
until these revolts turkmen tribesmen were an integral part of the seljuk military forces
turkmen migrated with their families and possessions on seljuk campaigns into azerbaijan and anatolia a process that began the turkification of these areas
during this time turkmen also began to settle the area of present day turkmenistan
prior to the turkmen habitation most of this desert had been uninhabited while the more habitable areas along the caspian sea kopetdag mountains amu darya and murgap river murgap deryasy were populated predominantly by iranians
the city state of merv was an especially large sedentary and agricultural area important as both a regional economic cultural center and a transit hub on the silk road
the last powerful seljuk ruler sultan sanjar d
witnessed the fragmentation and destruction of the empire because of attacks by turkmen and other tribes
during the reign of sultan sanjar or sinjar of the same house in the middle of the th century merv was overrun by the turkish tribes of the ghuzz from beyond the oxus
it eventually passed under the sway of the rulers of khwarizm khiva
after mixing with the settled peoples in turkmenistan the oguz living north of the kopet dag mountains gradually became known as the turkmen
the seljuk empire broke down in the second half of the th century and the turkmen became independent tribal federation
in the rule of seljuks dynasty came to an end in the province of khorasan
the turkic rulers of khiva took control of the area of turkmenistan under the title of khwarezmshahs in central asia suffered a disastrous invasion by mongol warriors who swept across the region from their base in eastern asia
under their commander genghis khan founder of the mongol empire the mongols conquered khwarezm and burned the city of merv to the ground
the mongol leader ordered the massacre of merv s inhabitants as well as the destruction of the province s farms and irrigation works which effectively ended the iranian dominance in urban areas and agricultural communities of khwarezm
these areas were soon repopulated by the turkmen who survived the invasion and had retreated northward to the plains of kazakhstan or westward to the shores of the caspian sea
after the division of the mongol empire present turkmenistan was passed to chagatai khanate except southernmost part was belonged to ilkhanate
small semi independent states arose under the rule of the region s tribal chiefs later in the th century
in the s amir timur also known as tamerlane one of the greatest conquerors in human history captured turkmen states once more and established the short lived timurid empire which collapsed after timur s death in when turkmens became independent once again
as a whole the th to th centuries was a period in which the turkmen s dislocation due to the mongol invasions gave way to new political groupings which became tribal groupings which have continued to modern day
in addition to the new political arrangements historical sources suggest that a large tribal union called the salor confederation remained from the original oghuz tribes and into modern times
in the late th century the confederation fell apart and three senior tribes moved eastward and then southward
of these tribes the yomud split into eastern and western groups and the teke migrated to the ahal region near the kopetdag mountains and eventually into the murghab river basin
other salor tribes moved into the region near the amu darya delta and into other parts of modern day southeast turkmenistan
salor groups also live in turkey afghanistan uzbekistan and china
the history of turkmenistan from the th until the th century is mostly known by the relations with the states of iran khiva bukhara and afghanistan
wars of the period took place mostly in the lands of turkmenistan
the invasion of the khan of khiva abul gazi bahadur khan from to caused some difficulties to the turkmens coupled with the impact of the drought that occurred at about the same period most of the turkmens within the khanate moved to areas around ahal atrek murgap and tejen
in this period many of the turkmens tribes living around the aral sea also migrated because of pressures from both the khiva khanate and the kalmyks and migrated to astrakhan and stavropol in the northern caucasus
popular epics such as koroglu and other oral traditions took shape during this period which could be taken as a beginning of turkmen nation
the poets and thinkers of the time such as devlet mehmed azadi and magtymguly pyragy became a voice for an emerging nation calling for unity brotherhood and peace among turkmen tribes
magtymguly pyragy is venerated in turkmenistan as the father of national literature
most of present turkmenistan was divided between khanates of khiva and bukhara except southernmost parts were handed to persia
nader shah of persia conquered it in but after him assassination in turkmen lands were recaptured by uzbek khanates of khiva and bukhara
during the s the teke turkmen then living on the tejen river were forced by the persians to migrate northward
khiva contested the advance of the tekes but ultimately about the latter became the sovereign power of southern and southeastern parts of present turkmenistan
in the th century turkoman tribes came into contact with tsarist empire
the russian empire began to move into the area in with the establishment of the caspian sea port of krasnovodsk present day turkmenbashy
after the suppression of the emirate of bukhara and the khanate of khiva the turkmen area remained independent
russians decided to move into transcaspian region allegedly to subdue turkmen slave trade and banditry
the service of some turkmen tribes especially the yomut for the khivan khan also encouraged the russia to punish them by raids into khwarazm which killed hundreds
these wars culminated in the battle of geok tepe in where general skobelev massacred turkmens at the desert fortress of geok depe near modern ashgabat another were killed trying to flee across the desert
in september of that year qajar iran signed the treaty of akhal with imperial russia which officially recognized the territory that today incorporates modern turkmenistan as part of the russian empire
by imperial russia had taken control of almost all of turkmenistan except around part of konye urgench was in khiva and around part of charju was in emirate of bukhara
the transcaspian railway was started from the shores of the caspian in in order to secure russian control over the region and provide a rapid military route to the afghan border
in a crisis was precipitated by the russian annexation of the pandjeh oasis to the south of merv on a territory of modern afghanistan which nearly led to war with britain
as it was thought that the russians were planning to march on to herat in afghanistan
until transcaspia was part of the governor generalship of the caucasus and administered from tiflis but in that year it was made an oblast of russian turkestan and governed from tashkent
nevertheless turkestan remained an isolated colonial outpost with an administration that preserved many distinctive features from the previous islamic regimes including qadis courts and a native administration that devolved much power to local aksakals elders
in the transcaspian railway reached tashkent and finally in a direct rail link with european russia was opened across the steppe from orenburg to tashkent
this led to much larger numbers of slavic settlers flowing into turkestan than had hitherto been the case and their settlement was overseen by a specially created migration department in st
petersburg
this caused considerable discontent amongst the local turkmen population as mainly russian populated cities such as ashgabat appeared
the best known military governor to have ruled the region from ashkhabad was probably general kuropatkin whose authoritarian methods and personal style of governance made the province very difficult for his successors to control and led to a revolt in
consequently the administration of transcaspia became a byword for corruption and brutality within russian turkestan as russian administrators turned their districts into petty fiefdoms and extorted money from the local population
in count konstantin konstantinovich pahlen led a reforming commission to turkestan which produced a monumental report detailing these abuses of power administrative corruption and inefficiency
following the october revolution of in russia ashgabat became a base for anti bolshevik counter revolutionaries who soon came under attack from the tashkent soviet
the communists succeeded in taking control of ashkhabad in the summer of forming a soviet
in response junaid khan and forces loyal to the czarist government joined together to drive out the communists
in july these anti communist allies established the independent state of transcaspia
a small british force led by general wilfrid malleson from meshed persia occupied ashgabat and parts of southern turkmenistan until
it is alleged that baku commissars were gunned down by british forces or their transcaspian allies
the region was one of the last centres of basmachi resistance to bolshevik rule with the last of the rebellious turkoman fleeing across the border to afghanistan and iran in
on october the turkestan assr was dissolved
in accordance with the decree of the central executive committee of the ussr and the turkmen ssr it became one of the republics of the soviet union
at this time the modern borders of turkmenistan were formed
the turkmen government renamed ashgabat into poltoratsk after a local revolutionary however the name ashgabat was restored in
in february the turkmenistan communist party held its first congress in ashkhabad
from this period onward the city experienced rapid growth and industrialisation although it was severely disrupted by the october ashgabat earthquake
with an estimated surface wave magnitude of the earthquake killed
according to other local sources two thirds of a population of inhabitants perished
in the s the kilometre long qaraqum canal was built
draining the amu darya river it enabled huge areas to be opened for cotton production
it also greatly diminished the inflow of water to the aral sea resulting in an ecological catastrophe
turkmenistan was not among the most economically developed soviet republics with a largely agrarian economy
this is despite exploration and exploitation of enormous oil and gas resources discovery of trillion cubic feet dawletabad gas field in the s became the largest gas field find in the world outside russia and middle east
turkmenistan became independent on october amidst the dissolution of the soviet union commemorated annually
the former head of turkmenistan s communist party at the time of independence saparmurat niyazov was elected president of the newly independent nation in an uncontested election
at the th congress of the communist party of turkmenistan in the autumn of the party decided to dissolve itself a process that continued into
in its place the turkmenistan democratic party tdp was organized and on december saparmurat
niyazov who was elected president of turkmenistan in october signed a decree officially
conferring tdp membership on former tcp members
the authoritarian niyazov who has assumed the title of turkmenbashi or leader of all turkmen was accused of developing a totalitarian cult of personality
his opus the ruhnama was made a mandatory reading in turkmenistan s schools and months of the calendar were renamed after members of his family
opposition parties are banned in turkmenistan and the government controls all sources of information
in december turkmenistan s constitution was amended to allow niyazov to serve as president for life
niyazov was the main proponent of turkmenistan s constitutional neutrality
under this policy turkmenistan does not participate in any military alliance and does not contribute to united nations monitoring forces
this in fact means an internal isolation of turkmenistan from world politics
in late niyazov met with former canadian prime minister jean chr tien to discuss an oil contract in turkmenistan for a canadian corporation
in march news of this meeting caused an uproar amongst opposition circles in canada who claimed the affair could damage chr tien s legacy
in niyazov announced that his country would downgrade its links with the commonwealth of independent states a loose alliance of post soviet states
he furthermore promised free and fair elections by in a move that surprised many western observers
niyazov acknowledged having heart disease in november
on december niyazov died unexpectedly leaving no heir apparent and an unclear line of succession
a former deputy prime minister rumored to be the illegitimate son of niyazov gurbanguly berdimuhamedow became acting president
under the constitution the chairman of the people s council wezgeldi ata ew should have succeeded to the post
ata ew was accused of crimes and removed from office
in an election on february gurbanguly berdimuhamedow was elected president with of the vote and turnout although the election was condemned by outside observers
following his election berdimuhamedow moved to reduce foreign isolation and reversed some of niyazov s more egocentric and damaging policies
internet cafes offering free and uncensored web access opened in ashgabat compulsory education was extended from nine to ten years and classes in sports and foreign languages were re introduced into the curriculum and the government announced plans to open several specialized schools for the arts
president berdimuhamedow has called for reform of education health care and pension systems and government officials of non turkmen ethnic origin who had been sacked by niyazov have returned to work
president berdimuhamedow began to reduce the personality cult surrounding niyazov and the office of the president
he called for an end to the elaborate pageants of music and dancing that formerly greeted the president on his arrival anywhere and said that the turkmen sacred oath part of which states that the speaker s tongue should shrivel if he ever speaks ill of turkmenistan or its president should not be recited multiple times a day but reserved for special occasions previously the oath was recited at the beginning and end of tv news reports by students at the beginning of the school day and at the beginning of virtually all meetings of any official nature that took place in the country
however berdimuhamedow is criticized for building a personality cult of his own albeit a modest one compared to his predecessor s
for example he is the only person whose first name is used in government press releases other officials always have their first names abbreviated to a single letter
he is also sometimes called the turkmen leader by his country s press
additionally while his regime is somewhat less heavy handed than niyazov s it is still rigidly authoritarian
on march berdimuhamedow reversed one of niyazov s most unpopular decrees by giving pensions back to elderly people whose pensions niyazov had slashed in the face of an unspecified budget crisis
on march in a decision of significant symbolic weight in the ongoing rejection of niyazov s personality cult he abolished the power of the president to rename any landmarks institutions or cities
on march the th congress of the halk maslahaty began in the city of mary
new laws relating to agricultural efficiency were passed and it was decreed that school teachers wages would soon rise by
on may russia and turkmenistan announced that they had reached an agreement to build a new natural gas pipeline from turkmenistan to russia via kazakhstan
this has led to speculation that the european union will become more energy dependent on russia which buys turkmen gas at below market prices and that as a result russia s political influence in eastern europe may increase
on may in what was described as one of his boldest moves up to that time berdimuhamedow sacked a high ranking security official who had been instrumental in building and maintaining the late president niyazov s extensive cult of personality
according to official turkmen news media akmyrat rejepow the head of the presidential security service was removed from office by presidential decree and transferred to another job the nature of this job was not specified
on june berdimuhamedow re opened the turkmen academy of sciences which had been shut down by his predecessor
according to reports as of june berdimuhamedow had also ordered the closure of the international fund of saparmurat niyazov the former turkmenbashi s personal private fund and stated his intent to begin a series of reforms in the military
berdimuhamedow celebrated his th birthday on june
he was awarded the watan order order of the motherland for his outstanding achievements a gold and diamond pendant weighing about kilogram
the president also published his biography and held a gala birthday celebration
the government also issued gold and silver coins decorated with the president s portrait
in berdimuhamedow restored the latin based names of the months and traditional persian and turkic days of the week niyazov had renamed them after himself and his mother among other things and announced plans to move the infamous gold rotating statue of niyazov from ashgabat s central square
he has not however moved toward western style democracy
in september a new constitution was accepted by the people s council
parliamentary elections under this new constitution were held on december
in december berdimuhamedow announced changes to the national anthem which involved removing the repeated references to former president niyazov
the new version was to take effect on december the second anniversary of niyazov s death
in february president gurbanguly berdymukhamedov was re elected for a third term in office after receiving percent of all votes according to official results following a tightly controlled and largely ceremonial election
he continued to rule as authoritarian strongman

he was declared the winner of the march presidential election
