Wuthering Heights is a film directed by Robert Fuest and starring Anna Calder Marshall and Timothy Dalton It is based on the classic Emily Brontë novel of the same name Like the version it depicts only the first sixteen chapters concluding with Catherine Earnshaw Linton's death and omits the trials of her daughter Hindley's son and Heathcliff's son
Peter Sallis as Mr ShieldersThis film version differs from the book in several ways and most of the differences involve Hindley Earnshaw First it takes a more sympathetic look at Hindley Usually portrayed as being a cruel oppressor of Heathcliff in this version he is persecuted by his father and lives in Heathcliff's shadow Also in this version Nelly Dean the narrator is shown as being in love with Hindley and unable to express her feelings due to their class difference After his wife's death Hindley goes through a hedonistic stage but finally pulls himself out of it
At the end of the film perhaps the most controversial of all the differences Hindley succeeds in fatally shooting Heathcliff and remains the owner of Wuthering Heights Heathcliff and Cathy's ghosts are then reunited
When first introducing Heathcliff the film also suggests that Heathcliff might be Mr Earnshaw's illegitimate son and hence Cathy's half brother
AIP were not traditionally associated with Gothic romance but were inspired to make the film by the success of Romeo and Juliet
The movie was shot on location in Blubberhouses Weston Hall near Otley and Brimham Rocks Producer Lous Heyward said at the time
I'm the only American here For the first time in years Hollywood said to me 'No big names no huge publicity just a good film that stands on its merits' This is very encouraging except now we stand naked in judgement It has to be really good with two to three million dollars invested The last version with Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff and Merle Oberon as Cathy portrayed him as a regular nice guy and her as sweetness and light That was not the truth and Hollywood now goes in for the truth Heathcliff was a bastard and Cathy a real bitch and that's how they'll be in this filmVincent Canby of The New York Times remarked that the film is simply petulant when it tries to be overwrought which may be what American International Pictures publicity people mean when they describe the film as 'youth oriented' Variety called it a competent tasteful frequently even lovely re adaptation of Emily Bronte's Gothic mystical love story But the brooding tension the electric passion of two lovers compelled to an inevitable tragedy is not generated Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one star out of four and wrote that the actors are simply not equal to the demands of the script that if not controlled easily slips into laughable melodrama adding that the film has the unfortunate physical appearance of a vampire tale
Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times stated At the tag end of the sight of Emily Bronte's Cathy Earnshaw running all over those Yorkshire moors shouting Heathcliff Heathcliff seems supremely silly—at least in AIP's handsome new version of 'Wuthering Heights' The trouble is that it's impossible to care about any of these people so self indulgent are they in their romanticism As a result you come away from the film thinking how much healthier and honest are today's young people the audience for which this picture presumably is intended Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film as inane and incoherent with such a tenuous sickly resemblance to the book it's based on and whose reputation it's confiscating that in simple justice the producers should be restrained from using the original title Some of the film characters have the same names as Mis Bronte's characters but the resemblance ceases right about there her story her atmosphere and her emotions are almost totally ignored bungled or butchered David Pirie of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote At the very least the combination of AIP and Emily Brontë promises a creative tension but it turns out to provide only a flattened and monotonous version of her classic novel they have played safe in the worst possible way reducing and telescoping the action into a meagre spiritless soap opera with everyone lacking conviction and Heathcliff in particular about as demonic as a shy farm hand
The film holds a score of on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews
