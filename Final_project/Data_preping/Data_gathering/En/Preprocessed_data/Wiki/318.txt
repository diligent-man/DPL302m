shieldersthis film version differs from the book in several ways and most of the differences involve hindley earnshaw
first it takes a more sympathetic look at hindley
usually portrayed as being a cruel oppressor of heathcliff in this version he is persecuted by his father and lives in heathcliff s shadow
also in this version nelly dean the narrator is shown as being in love with hindley and unable to express her feelings due to their class difference
after his wife s death hindley goes through a hedonistic stage but finally pulls himself out of it
at the end of the film perhaps the most controversial of all the differences hindley succeeds in fatally shooting heathcliff and remains the owner of wuthering heights
heathcliff and cathy s ghosts are then reunited
when first introducing heathcliff the film also suggests that heathcliff might be mr earnshaw s illegitimate son and hence cathy s half brother
aip were not traditionally associated with gothic romance but were inspired to make the film by the success of romeo and juliet
the movie was shot on location in blubberhouses weston hall near otley and brimham rocks
producer lous heyward said at the time
i m the only american here
for the first time in years hollywood said to me no big names no huge publicity just a good film that stands on its merits
this is very encouraging except now we stand naked in judgement
it has to be really good with two to three million dollars invested
the last version with laurence olivier as heathcliff and merle oberon as cathy portrayed him as a regular nice guy and her as sweetness and light
that was not the truth and hollywood now goes in for the truth
heathcliff was a bastard and cathy a real bitch and that s how they ll be in this film vincent canby of the new york times remarked that the film is simply petulant when it tries to be overwrought which may be what american international pictures publicity people mean when they describe the film as youth oriented variety called it a competent tasteful frequently even lovely re adaptation of emily bronte s gothic mystical love story
but the brooding tension the electric passion of two lovers compelled to an inevitable tragedy is not generated gene siskel of the chicago tribune gave the film one star out of four and wrote that the actors are simply not equal to the demands of the script that if not controlled easily slips into laughable melodrama adding that the film has the unfortunate physical appearance of a vampire tale
kevin thomas of the los angeles times stated at the tag end of the sight of emily bronte s cathy earnshaw running all over those yorkshire moors shouting heathcliff heathcliff seems supremely silly at least in aip s handsome new version of wuthering heights
the trouble is that it s impossible to care about any of these people so self indulgent are they in their romanticism
as a result you come away from the film thinking how much healthier and honest are today s young people the audience for which this picture presumably is intended gary arnold of the washington post panned the film as inane and incoherent with such a tenuous sickly resemblance to the book it s based on and whose reputation it s confiscating that in simple justice the producers should be restrained from using the original title
some of the film characters have the same names as mis bronte s characters but the resemblance ceases right about there her story her atmosphere and her emotions are almost totally ignored bungled or butchered david pirie of the monthly film bulletin wrote at the very least the combination of aip and emily bront promises a creative tension but it turns out to provide only a flattened and monotonous version of her classic novel
they have played safe in the worst possible way reducing and telescoping the action into a meagre spiritless soap opera with everyone lacking conviction and heathcliff in particular about as demonic as a shy farm hand
the film holds a score of on rotten tomatoes based on reviews
aip had announced a sequel return to wuthering heights but it was not made
neither were other adaptations of classic novels mooted by the studio including camille the house of seven gables and tale of two cities
