thermodynamics thermodynamic state system condition specific time fully identified value suitable set parameter known state variable state parameter thermodynamic variables
set value thermodynamic variable ha specified system value thermodynamic property system uniquely determined
usually default thermodynamic state taken one thermodynamic equilibrium
mean state merely condition system specific time condition unchanging indefinitely long duration time
thermodynamics set idealized conceptual structure summarized formal scheme definition postulates
thermodynamic state amongst fundamental primitive object notion scheme existence primary definitive rather derived constructed concepts
rather general infinitely many different alternative physical system comprise given thermodynamic system general physical system ha vastly many microscopic characteristic mentioned thermodynamic description
thermodynamic system macroscopic object microscopic detail explicitly considered thermodynamic description
number state variable required specify thermodynamic state depends system always known advance experiment usually found experimental evidence
though number state variable fixed experiment remains choice use particular convenient description given thermodynamic system may alternatively identified several different choice set state variables
choice usually made basis wall surroundings relevant thermodynamic process considered system
example intended consider heat transfer system wall system permeable heat wall connect system body surroundings ha definite time-invariant temperature
equilibrium thermodynamics thermodynamic state system content internal thermodynamic equilibrium zero flow quantity internal system surroundings
planck primary characteristic thermodynamic state system consists single phase absence externally imposed force field spatial homogeneity
non-equilibrium thermodynamics suitable set identifying state variable includes macroscopic variable example non-zero spatial gradient temperature indicate departure thermodynamic equilibrium
non-equilibrium identifying state variable indicate non-zero flow may occurring within system system surroundings
le directly described suitable set quantity includes state variable state functions
primary original identification thermodynamic state body matter directly measurable ordinary physical quantities
simple purpose given body given chemical constitution sufficient set quantity 'volume pressure'
besides directly measurable ordinary physical variable originally identify thermodynamic state system system characterized quantity called state function also called state variable thermodynamic variable state quantity function state
uniquely determined thermodynamic state ha identified original state variables
example internal energy enthalpy helmholtz free energy gibbs free energy thermodynamic temperature entropy
given body given chemical constitution thermodynamic state ha fully defined pressure volume temperature uniquely determined
thermodynamic temperature specifically thermodynamic concept original directly measureable state variable defined ordinary physical measurement without reference thermodynamic concept reason helpful regard thermodynamic temperature state function
passage given initial thermodynamic state given final thermodynamic state thermodynamic system known thermodynamic process usually transfer matter energy system surroundings
thermodynamic process whatever may intermediate condition passage total respective change value thermodynamic state variable depends initial final states
idealized continuous quasi-static process mean infinitesimal incremental change variable exact differentials
together incremental change throughout process initial final state fully determine idealized process
commonly cited simple example ideal gas thermodynamic variable would three variable following four amount substance pressure temperature volume
thus thermodynamic state would range three-dimensional state space
remaining variable well quantity internal energy entropy would expressed state function three variables
state function satisfy certain universal constraint expressed law thermodynamics depend peculiarity material compose concrete system
various thermodynamic diagram developed model transition thermodynamic states
physical system found nature practically always dynamic complex many case macroscopic physical system amenable description based proximity ideal conditions
state primitive object classical equilibrium thermodynamics called thermodynamic state
based many observation thermodynamics postulate system isolated external environment evolve approach unique stable equilibrium states
number different type equilibrium corresponding different physical variable system reach thermodynamic equilibrium condition relevant type equilibrium simultaneously satisfied
thermal equilibrium temperature throughout system uniform system thermal equilibrium
mechanical equilibrium every point within given system change pressure time movement material system mechanical equilibrium
