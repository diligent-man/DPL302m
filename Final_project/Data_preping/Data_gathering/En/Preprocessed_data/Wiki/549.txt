Honduras officially the Republic of Honduras is a country in Central America
The republic of Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala to the southwest by El Salvador to the southeast by Nicaragua to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea
Its capital and largest city is Tegucigalpa
Honduras was home to several important Mesoamerican cultures most notably the Maya before the Spanish Colonization in the sixteenth century
The Spanish introduced Catholicism and the now predominant Spanish language along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous culture
Honduras became independent in and has since been a republic although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability and remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere
In the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice
The nation's economy is primarily agricultural making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch in
The lower class is primarily agriculturally based while wealth is concentrated in the country's urban centers
Honduras has a Human Development Index of classifying it as a nation with medium development
When adjusted for income inequality its Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is
Honduran society is predominantly Mestizo however there are also significant American Indian black and white communities in Honduras
The nation had a relatively high political stability until its coup and again with the presidential election
Honduras spans about km sq mi and has a population exceeding million
Its northern portions are part of the western Caribbean zone as reflected in the area's demographics and culture
Honduras is known for its rich natural resources including minerals coffee tropical fruit and sugar cane as well as for its growing textiles industry which serves the international market
The literal meaning of the term Honduras is depths in Spanish
The name could either refer to the bay of Trujillo as an anchorage fondura in the Leonese dialect of Spain or to Columbus's alleged quote that Gracias a Dios que hemos salido de esas honduras Thank God we have departed from those depths
It was not until the end of the th century that Honduras was used for the whole province
Prior to Honduras referred to only the eastern part of the province and Higueras referred to the western part
Another early name is Guaymuras revived as the name for the political dialogue in that took place in Honduras as opposed to Costa Rica
Hondurans are often referred to as Catracho or Catracha fem in Spanish
The word was coined by Nicaraguans and derives from the last name of the Spanish Honduran General Florencio Xatruch who in led Honduran armed forces against an attempted invasion by North American adventurer William Walker
The nickname is considered complimentary not derogatory
In the pre-Columbian era modern Honduras was split between two pan-cultural regions Mesoamerica in the west and the Isthmo-Colombian area in the east
Each complex had a core area within Honduras the Sula Valley for Mesoamerica and La Mosquitia for the Isthmo-Colombian area and the intervening area was one of gradual transition
However these concepts had no meaning in the Pre-Columbian era itself and represent extremely diverse areas
The Lenca people of the interior highlands are also generally considered to be culturally Mesoamerican though the extent of linkage with other areas varied over time for example expanding during the zenith of the Toltec Empire
In the extreme west Maya civilization flourished for hundreds of years
The dominant best known and best studied state within Honduras's borders was in Copn which was located in a mainly non-Maya area or on the frontier between Maya and non-Maya areas
Copn declined with other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the Terminal Classic in the th century
The Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the Ch'orti' isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west
However Copn represents only a fraction of Honduran pre-Columbian history
Remnants of other civilizations are found throughout the country
Archaeologists have studied sites such as Naco es and La Sierra in the Naco Valley Los Naranjos on Lake Yojoa Yarumela in the Comayagua Valley La Ceiba and Salitron Viejo both now under the Cajn Dam reservoir Selin Farm and Cuyamel in the Aguan valley Cerro Palenque Travesia Curruste Ticamaya Despoloncal and Playa de los Muertos in the lower Ula River valley and many others
In LiDAR scanning revealed that several previously unknown high density settlements existed in La Mosquitia corresponding to the legend of La Ciudad Blanca
Excavation and study has since improved knowledge of the region's history
It is estimated that these settlements reached their zenith from to AD
On his fourth and the final voyage to the New World in Christopher Columbus landed near the modern town of Trujillo near Guaimoreto Lagoon becoming the first European to visit the Bay Islands on the coast of Honduras
On July Columbus sent his brother Bartholomew to explore the islands and Bartholomew encountered a Mayan trading vessel from Yucatn carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo
Bartholomew's men stole the cargo they wanted and kidnapped the ship's elderly captain to serve as an interpreter in the first recorded encounter between the Spanish and the Maya
In March Gil Gonzlez Dvila became the first Spaniard to enter Honduras as a conquistador
followed by Hernn Corts who had brought forces down from Mexico
Much of the conquest took place in the following two decades first by groups loyal to Cristbal de Olid and then by those loyal to Francisco de Montejo but most particularly by those following Alvarado
In addition to Spanish resources the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from Mexicoâ€”Tlaxcalans and Mexica armies of thousands who remained garrisoned in the region
Resistance to conquest was led in particular by Lempira
Many regions in the north of Honduras never fell to the Spanish notably the Miskito Kingdom
After the Spanish conquest Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World within the Kingdom of Guatemala
Trujillo and Gracias were the first city-capitals
The Spanish ruled the region for approximately three centuries
Honduras was organized as a province of the Kingdom of Guatemala and the capital was fixed first at Trujillo on the Atlantic coast and later at Comayagua and finally at Tegucigalpa in the central part of the country
Silver mining was a key factor in the Spanish conquest and settlement of Honduras
Initially the mines were worked by local people through the encomienda system but as disease and resistance made this option less available slaves from other parts of Central America were brought in
When local slave trading stopped at the end of the sixteenth century African slaves mostly from Angola were imported
After about very few slaves or other outside workers arrived in Honduras
Although the Spanish conquered the southern or Pacific portion of Honduras fairly quickly they were less successful on the northern or Atlantic side
They managed to found a few towns along the coast at Puerto Caballos and Trujillo in particular but failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of independent indigenous people as well
The Miskito Kingdom in the northeast was particularly effective at resisting conquest
The Miskito Kingdom found support from northern European privateers pirates and especially the British formerly English colony of Jamaica which placed much of the area under its protection after
Honduras gained independence from Spain in and was a part of the First Mexican Empire until when it became part of the United Provinces of Central America
It has been an independent republic and has held regular elections since
In the s and s Honduras participated in several failed attempts at Central American unity such as the Confederation of Central America the covenant of Guatemala the Diet of Sonsonate the Diet of Nacaome and National Representation in Central America
Although Honduras eventually adopted the name Republic of Honduras the unionist ideal never waned and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity
Policies favoring international trade and investment began in the s and soon foreign interests became involved first in shipping from the north coast especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas and then in building railroads
In a projected railroad line from the Caribbean coast to the capital Tegucigalpa ran out of money when it reached San Pedro Sula
As a result San Pedro grew into the nation's primary industrial center and second-largest city
Comayagua was the capital of Honduras until when the capital moved to Tegucigalpa
Since independence nearly small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the country including some changes of rgime
In the late nineteenth century Honduras granted land and substantial exemptions to several US-based fruit and infrastructure companies in return for developing the country's northern regions
Thousands of workers came to the north coast as a result to work in banana plantations and other businesses that grew up around the export industry
Banana-exporting companies dominated until by the Cuyamel Fruit Company as well as the United Fruit Company and Standard Fruit Company built an enclave economy in northern Honduras controlling infrastructure and creating self-sufficient tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively little to economic growth
American troops landed in Honduras in and
Henry coined the term banana republic to describe Honduras publishing a book called Cabbages and Kings about a fictional country Anchuria inspired by his experiences in Honduras where he had lived for six months
In The Admiral OHenry refers to the nation as a small maritime banana republic naturally the fruit was the entire basis of its economy
According to a literary analyst writing for The Economist his phrase neatly conjures up the image of a tropical agrarian country
But its real meaning is sharper it refers to the fruit companies from the United States that came to exert extraordinary influence over the politics of Honduras and its neighbors In addition to drawing Central American workers north the fruit companies encouraged immigration of workers from the English-speaking Caribbean notably Jamaica and Belize which introduced an African-descended English-speaking and largely Protestant population into the country although many of these workers left following changes to immigration law in
Honduras joined the Allied Nations after Pearl Harbor on December and signed the Declaration by United Nations on January along with twenty-five other governments
Constitutional crises in the s led to reforms in the s
One reform gave workers permission to organize and a general strike paralyzed the northern part of the country for more than two months but led to reforms
In a military coup unseated democratically elected President Ramn Villeda Morales
In the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice
In Honduras and El Salvador fought what became known as the Football War
Border tensions led to acrimony between the two countries after Oswaldo Lpez Arellano the president of Honduras blamed the deteriorating Honduran economy on immigrants from El Salvador
The relationship reached a low when El Salvador met Honduras for a three-round football elimination match preliminary to the World Cup
Tensions escalated and on July the Salvadoran army invaded Honduras
The Organization of American States OAS negotiated a cease-fire which took effect on July and brought about a withdrawal of Salvadoran troops in early August
Contributing factors to the conflict were a boundary dispute and the presence of thousands of Salvadorans living in Honduras illegally
After the week-long war as many as Salvadoran immigrants were expelled
Hurricane Fifi caused severe damage when it skimmed the northern coast of Honduras on and September
Melgar Castro and Paz Garcia largely built the current physical infrastructure and telecommunications system of Honduras
In the country returned to civilian rule
A constituent assembly was popularly elected in April to write a new constitution and general elections were held in November
The constitution was approved in and the PLH government of Roberto Suazo won the election with a promise to carry out an ambitious program of economic and social development to tackle the recession in which Honduras found itself
He launched ambitious social and economic development projects sponsored by American development aid
Honduras became host to the largest Peace Corps mission in the world and nongovernmental and international voluntary agencies proliferated
The Peace Corps withdrew its volunteers in citing safety concerns
During the early s the United States established a continuing military presence in Honduras to support El Salvador the Contra guerrillas fighting the Nicaraguan government and also develop an airstrip and modern port in Honduras
Though spared the bloody civil wars wracking its neighbors the Honduran army quietly waged campaigns against MarxistLeninist militias such as the Cinchoneros Popular Liberation Movement notorious for kidnappings and bombings and against many non-militants as well
The operation included a campaign of extrajudicial killings by government units most notably the CIA-trained Battalion
In Hurricane Mitch caused massive and widespread destruction
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores said that fifty years of progress in the country had been reversed
Mitch destroyed about of the country's crops and an estimated of the transportation infrastructure including nearly all bridges and secondary roads
Across Honduras houses were destroyed and an additional damaged
Total losses were estimated at US billion
In President of Honduras Manuel Zelaya and President of the United States George W
Bush began talks on US assistance to Honduras to tackle the latter's growing drug cartels in Mosquito Eastern Honduras using US Special Forces
This marked the beginning of a new foothold for the US Military's continued presence in Central America
Under Zelaya Honduras joined ALBA in but withdrew in after the Honduran coup d'tat
In a constitutional crisis resulted when power was transferred in a coup from the president to the head of Congress
The OAS suspended Honduras because it did not regard its government as legitimate
Countries around the world the OAS and the United Nations formally and unanimously condemned the action as a coup d'tat refusing to recognize the de facto government even though the lawyers consulted by the Library of Congress submitted to the United States Congress an opinion that declared the coup legal
The Honduran Supreme Court also ruled that the proceedings had been legal
The government that followed the de facto government established a truth and reconciliation commission Comisin de la Verdad y Reconciliacin which after more than a year of research and debate concluded that the ousting had been a coup d'tat and illegal in the commission's opinion
On November the former first lady Xiomara Castro leftist presidential candidate of opposition Liberty and Refoundation Party won of the votes in the presidential election to become the first female president of Honduras meaning the end to the -year reign of the right-wing National Party
Her husband Manuel Zelaya held the same office from until
In April former president of Honduras Juan Orlando Hernndez who served two terms between and January was extradited to the United States to face charges of drug trafficking and money laundering
The north coast of Honduras borders the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean lies south through the Gulf of Fonseca
Honduras consists mainly of mountains with narrow plains along the coasts
A large undeveloped lowland jungle La Mosquitia lies in the northeast and the heavily populated lowland Sula valley in the northwest
In La Mosquitia lies the UNESCO world-heritage site Ro Pltano Biosphere Reserve with the Coco River which divides Honduras from Nicaragua
The Islas de la Baha and the Swan Islands are off the north coast
Misteriosa Bank and Rosario Bank to kilometres to miles north of the Swan Islands fall within the Exclusive Economic Zone EEZ of Honduras
Natural resources include timber gold silver copper lead zinc iron ore antimony coal fish shrimp and hydropower
The climate varies from tropical in the lowlands to temperate in the mountains
The central and southern regions are relatively hotter and less humid than the northern coast
The region is considered a biodiversity hotspot because of the many plant and animal species found there
Like other countries in the region it contains vast biological resources
Honduras hosts more than species of vascular plants of which described so far are orchids around reptiles and amphibians more than bird species and mammalian species of which half are bats
In the northeastern region of La Mosquitia lies the Ro Pltano Biosphere Reserve a lowland rainforest which is home to a great diversity of life
The reserve was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites List in
Honduras has rain forests cloud forests which can rise up to nearly metres or feet above sea level mangroves savannas and mountain ranges with pine and oak trees and the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System
In the Bay Islands there are bottlenose dolphins manta rays parrot fish schools of blue tang and whale shark
Deforestation resulting from logging is rampant in Olancho Department
The clearing of land for agriculture is prevalent in the largely undeveloped La Mosquitia region causing land degradation and soil erosion
Honduras had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of ranking it th globally out of countries
Lake Yojoa which is Honduras's largest source of fresh water is polluted by heavy metals produced from mining activities
Some rivers and streams are also polluted by mining
Honduras is governed within a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic
The President of Honduras is both head of state and head of government
Executive power is exercised by the Honduran government
Legislative power is vested in the National Congress of Honduras
The judiciary is independent of both the executive branch and the legislature
The National Congress of Honduras Congreso Nacional has members diputados elected for a four-year term by proportional representation
Congressional seats are assigned the parties' candidates on a departmental basis in proportion to the number of votes each party receives
In a military coup removed the democratically elected president Ramn Villeda Morales
A string of authoritarian military governments held power uninterrupted until when Roberto Suazo Crdova was elected president
The party system was dominated by the conservative National Party of Honduras Partido Nacional de Honduras PNH and the liberal Liberal Party of Honduras Partido Liberal de Honduras PLH until the Honduran coup d'tat removed Manuel Zelaya from office and put Roberto Micheletti in his place
In late persons were interviewed by ERIC in collaboration with the Jesuit university as reported by Associated Press
This survey found that believed the police were involved in crime had no confidence in the Supreme Court and thought there was electoral fraud in the primary elections of November
Also expected the presidential legislative and municipal elections of to be fraudulent
Then-president Juan Orlando Hernndez took office on January
After managing to stand for a second term a very close election in left uncertainty as to whether then-President Hernandez or his main challenger television personality Salvador Nasralla had prevailed
The disputed election caused protests and violence
In December Hernndez was declared the winner of the election after a partial recount
In January Hernndez was sworn in for a second presidential term
He was succeeded by Xiomara Castro the leader of the left-wing Libre Party and wife of Manuel Zelaya on January becoming the first woman to serve as president
Honduras and Nicaragua had tense relations throughout and early due to a boundary dispute off the Atlantic coast
Nicaragua imposed a tariff against Honduran goods due to the dispute
In June a coup d'tat ousted President Manuel Zelaya he was taken in a military aircraft to Costa Rica
The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called for the restoration of Zelaya
Several Latin American nations including Mexico temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras
In July full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico
The United States sent out mixed messages after the coup Obama called the ouster a coup and expressed support for Zelaya's return to power
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advised by John Negroponte the former Reagan-era Ambassador to Honduras implicated in the IranContra affair refrained from expressing support
She has since explained that the US would have had to cut aid if it called Zelaya's ouster a military coup although the US has a record of ignoring these events when it chooses
Zelaya had expressed an interest in Hugo Chvez' Bolivarian Alliance for Peoples of our America ALBA and had actually joined in
After the coup Honduras withdrew its membership
This interest in regional agreements may have increased the alarm of establishment politicians
When Zelaya began calling for a fourth ballot box to determine whether Hondurans wished to convoke a special constitutional congress this sounded a lot to some like the constitutional amendments that had extended the terms of both Hugo Chvez and Evo Morales
Chvez has served as a role model for like-minded leaders intent on cementing their power
These presidents are barely in office when they typically convene a constitutional convention to guarantee their reelection said a Spiegel International analysis which noted that one reason to join ALBA was discounted Venezuelan oil
In addition to Chvez and Morales Carlos Menem of Argentina Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Columbian President lvaro Uribe had all taken this step and Washington and the EU were both accusing the Sandinista National Liberation Front government in Nicaragua of tampering with election results
Politicians of all stripes expressed opposition to Zelaya's referendum proposal and the Attorney-General accused him of violating the constitution
The Honduran Supreme Court agreed saying that the constitution had put the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in charge of elections and referenda not the National Statistics Institute which Zelaya had proposed to have run the count
Whether or not Zelaya's removal from power had constitutional elements the Honduran constitution explicitly protects all Hondurans from forced expulsion from Honduras
The United States maintains a small military presence at one Honduran base
The two countries conduct joint peacekeeping counter-narcotics humanitarian disaster relief humanitarian medical and civic action exercises
troops conduct and provide logistics support for a variety of bilateral and multilateral exercises
The United States is Honduras's chief trading partner
Honduras has a military with the Honduran Army Honduran Navy and Honduran Air Force
In Honduras signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
The capital city is Tegucigalpa in the Central District within the department of Francisco Morazn
YoroA new administrative division called ZEDE Zonas de empleo y desarrollo econmico was created in
ZEDEs have a high level of autonomy with their own political system at a judicial economic and administrative level and are based on free market capitalism
The World Bank categorizes Honduras as a low middle-income nation
The nation's per capita income sits at around US dollars making it one of the lowest in North America
In of the population were living below the poverty line
By more than were living below the poverty line
Economic growth in the last few years has averaged a year one of the highest rates in Latin America
Despite this Honduras has seen the least development amongst all Central American countries
Honduras is ranked of countries with a Human Development Index of that classifies the nation as having medium development
The three factors that go into Honduras's HDI an extended and healthy life accessibility of knowledge and standard of living have all improved since but still remain relatively low with life expectancy at birth being expected years of schooling being mean of years and GNI per capita being
The HDI for Latin America and the Caribbean overall is with life expectancy at birth being expected years of schooling being mean of and GNI per capita being
The Honduran coup d'tat led to a variety of economic trends in the nation
Overall growth has slowed averaging percent from to but slowing to percent annually between and
Following the coup trends of decreasing poverty and extreme poverty were reversed
The nation saw a poverty increase of percent and in extreme poverty of percent in just years
Furthermore unemployment grew between and from percent to percent
Because much of the Honduran economy is based on small scale agriculture of only a few exports natural disasters have a particularly devastating impact
Natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch have contributed to this inequality as they particularly affect poor rural areas
Additionally they are a large contributor to food insecurity in the country as farmers are left unable to provide for their families
A study done by Honduras NGO World Neighbors determined the terms increased workload decreased basic grains expensive food and fear were most associated with Hurricane Mitch
The rural and urban poor were hit hardest by Hurricane Mitch
Those in southern and western regions specifically were considered most vulnerable as they both were subject to environmental destruction and home to many subsistence farmers
Due to disasters such as Hurricane Mitch the agricultural economic sector has declined a third in the past twenty years
This is mostly due to a decline in exports such as bananas and coffee that were affected by factors such as natural disasters
Indigenous communities along the Patuca River were hit extremely hard as well
The mid-Pataca region was almost completely destroyed
Over of rice harvest and all of banana plantain and manioc harvests were lost
Relief and reconstruction efforts following the storm were partial and incomplete reinforcing existing levels of poverty rather than reversing those levels especially for indigenous communities
The period between the end of food donations and the following harvest led to extreme hunger causing deaths amongst the Tawahka population
Those that were considered the most land-rich lost of their total land on average
Those that were the most land-poor lost less total land but a greater share of their overall total
This meant that those hit hardest were single women as they constitute the majority of this population
Since the s when Honduras was designated a food priority country by the UN organizations such as The World Food Program WFP have worked to decrease malnutrition and food insecurity
A large majority of Honduran farmers live in extreme poverty or below US dollars per capita
Currently one fourth of children are affected by chronic malnutrition
WFP is currently working with the Honduran government on a School Feeding Program which provides meals for Honduran schools reaching million school children
WFP also participates in disaster relief through reparations and emergency response in order to aid in quick recovery that tackles the effects of natural disasters on agricultural production
Honduras's Poverty Reduction Strategy was implemented in and aimed to cut extreme poverty in half by
While spending on poverty-reduction aid increased there was only a increase in GDP between and
This improvement left Honduras still below that of countries that lacked aid through Poverty Reduction Strategy behind those without it
The World Bank believes that this inefficiency stems from a lack of focus on infrastructure and rural development
Extreme poverty saw a low of percent only two years after the implementation of the strategy but then increased to percent by
Poverty Reduction Strategies were also intended to affect social policy through increased investment in education and health sectors
This was expected to lift poor communities out of poverty while also increasing the workforce as a means of stimulating the Honduran economy
Conditional cash transfers were used to do this by the Family Assistance Program
This program was restructured in in an attempt to increase effectiveness of cash transfers for health and education specifically for those in extreme poverty
Overall spending within Poverty Reduction Strategies have been focused on education and health sectors increasing social spending from of Honduras's GDP in to in
Critics of aid from International Finance Institutions believe that the World Bank's Poverty Reduction Strategy result in little substantive change to Honduran policy
Poverty Reduction Strategies also excluded clear priorities specific intervention strategy strong commitment to the strategy and more effective macro-level economic reforms according to Jose Cuesta of Cambridge University
Due to this he believes that the strategy did not provide a pathway for economic development that could lift Honduras out of poverty resulting in neither lasting economic growth of poverty reduction
Prior to its coup Honduras widely expanded social spending and an extreme increase in minimum wage
Efforts to decrease inequality were swiftly reversed following the coup
When Zelaya was removed from office social spending as a percent of GDP decreased from percent in to recent in
This decrease in social spending exacerbated the effects of the recession which the nation was previously relatively well equipped to deal with
Levels of income inequality in Honduras are higher than in any other Latin American country
Unlike other Latin American countries inequality steadily increased in Honduras between and
Between and inequality saw a decrease but increased again in
When Honduras's Human Development Index is adjusted for inequality known as the IHDI Honduras's development index is reduced to
The levels of inequality in each aspect of development can also be assessed
In inequality of life expectancy at birth was inequality in education was and inequality in income was The overall loss in human development due to inequality was
The IHDI for Latin America and the Caribbean overall is with an overall loss of
In for the entire region inequality of life expectancy at birth was inequality in education was and inequality in income was
While Honduras has a higher life expectancy than other countries in the region before and after inequality adjustments its quality of education and economic standard of living are lower
Income inequality and education inequality have a large impact on the overall development of the nation
Inequality also exists between rural and urban areas as it relates to the distribution of resources
Poverty is concentrated in southern eastern and western regions where rural and indigenous peoples live
North and central Honduras are home to the country's industries and infrastructure resulting in low levels of poverty
Poverty is concentrated in rural Honduras a pattern that is reflected throughout Latin America
The effects of poverty on rural communities are vast
Poor communities typically live in adobe homes lack material resources have limited access to medical resources and live off of basics such as rice maize and beans
The lower class predominantly consists of rural subsistence farmers and landless peasants
Since there has been an increase in the number of landless peasants in Honduras which has led to a growing class of urban poor individuals
These individuals often migrate to urban centers in search of work in the service sector manufacturing or construction
Demographers believe that without social and economic reform rural to urban migration will increase resulting in the expansion of urban centers
Within the lower class underemployment is a major issue
Individuals that are underemployed often only work as part-time laborers on seasonal farms meaning their annual income remains low
In the s peasant organizations and labor unions such as the National Federation of Honduran Peasants The National Association of Honduran Peasants and the National Union of Peasants formed
It is not uncommon for rural individuals to voluntarily enlist in the military however this often does not offer stable or promising career opportunities
The majority of high-ranking officials in the Honduran army are recruited from elite military academies
Additionally the majority of enlistment in the military is forced
Forced recruitment largely relies on an alliance between the Honduran government military and upper class Honduran society
In urban areas males are often sought out from secondary schools while in rural areas roadblocks aided the military in handpicking recruits
Higher socio-economic status enables individuals to more easily evade the draft
Middle class Honduras is a small group defined by relatively low membership and income levels
Movement from lower to middle class is typically facilitated by higher education
Professionals students farmers merchants business employees and civil servants are all considered a part of the Honduran middle class
Opportunities for employment and the industrial and commercial sectors are slow-growing limiting middle class membership
The Honduran upper class has much higher income levels than the rest of the Honduran population reflecting large amounts of income inequality
Much of the upper class affords their success to the growth of cotton and livestock exports post-World War II
The wealthy are not politically unified and differ in political and economic views
The government operates both the electrical grid Empresa Nacional de Energa Elctrica ENEE and the land-line telephone service Hondutel
ENEE receives heavy subsidies to counter its chronic financial problems but Hondutel is no longer a monopoly
The telecommunication sector was opened to private investment on December as required under CAFTA
The price of petroleum is regulated and the Congress often ratifies temporary price regulation for basic commodities
Gold silver lead and zinc are mined
In Honduras signed CAFTA a free trade agreement with the United States
In December Puerto Corts the primary seaport of Honduras was included in the US
Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy announced the first phase of the Secure Freight Initiative SFI which built upon existing port security measures
government enhanced authority allowing it to scan containers from overseas for nuclear and radiological materials in order to improve the risk assessment of individual US-bound containers
The initial phase of Secure Freight involved deploying of nuclear detection and other devices to six foreign ports
Gamman Terminal at Port Busan KoreaContainers in these ports have been scanned since for radiation and other risk factors before they are allowed to depart for the United States
For economic development a memorandum of understanding with a group of international investors obtained Honduran government approval to build a zone city with its own laws tax system judiciary and police but opponents brought a suit against it in the Supreme Court calling it a state within a state
In Honduras's Congress ratified Decree which led to the establishment of ZEDEs
The government began construction of the first zones in June
About half of the electricity sector in Honduras is privately owned
The remaining generation capacity is run by ENEE Empresa Nacional de Energa Elctrica
Financing investments in generation and transmission without either a financially healthy utility or concessionary funds from external donors
Re-balancing tariffs cutting arrears and reducing losses including electricity theft without social unrest
Reconciling environmental concerns with government objectives two large new dams and associated hydropower plants
Improving access to electricity in rural areasInfrastructure for transportation in Honduras consists of kilometres miles of railways kilometres miles of roadways six ports and airports altogether Paved unpaved
The Ministry of Public Works Transport and Housing SOPRTRAVI in Spanish acronym is responsible for transport sector policy
The proportion of the population below the age of in was were between and years old and were years old or older
Since emigration from Honduras has accelerated as economic migrants and political refugees sought a better life elsewhere
A majority of expatriate Hondurans live in the United States
A US State Department estimate suggested that between and one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time nearly of the Honduran population
The large uncertainty about numbers is because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa
In the census in the United States residents identified as Hondurans up from in
The ethnic breakdown of Honduran society was Mestizo American Indian Black and White
The Honduran census provides no racial data but in five classifications were created white Indian Negro yellow and mestizo
This system was used in the and census
Mestizo was used to describe individuals that did not fit neatly into the categories of white American Indian negro or yellow or who are of mixed white-American Indian descent
John Gillin considers Honduras to be one of thirteen Mestizo countries Mexico Guatemala El Salvador Nicaragua Panama Colombia Venezuela Cuba Ecuador Peru Bolivia Paraguay
He claims that in much as Spanish America little attention is paid to race and race mixture resulting in social status having little reliance on one's physical features
However in Mestizo countries such as Honduras this is not the case
Social stratification from Spain was able to develop in these countries through colonization
During colonization the majority of Honduras's indigenous population died of diseases like smallpox and measles resulting in a more homogenous indigenous population compared to other colonies
Nine indigenous and African American groups are recognized by the government in Honduras
The majority of Amerindians in Honduras are Lenca followed by the Miskito Cho'rti' Tolupan Pech and Sumo
Around Lenca individuals live in the west and western interior of Honduras while the other small native groups are located throughout the country
The majority of blacks in Honduran are culturally ladino meaning they are culturally Latino
Non-ladino groups in Honduras include the Black Carib Miskito Arab immigrants and the black population of the Islas de la Baha The Black Carib population descended from freed slaves from Saint Vincent
The Miskito population about individuals are the descendants of African and British immigrants and are extremely racially diverse
While the Black Carib and Miskito populations have similar origins Black Caribs are considered black while Miskitos are considered indigenous
This is largely a reflection of cultural differences as Black Caribs have retained much of their original African culture
The majority of Arab Hondurans are of Palestinian and Lebanese descent
They are known as turcos in Honduras because of migration during the rule of the Ottoman Empire
They have maintained cultural distinctiveness and prospered economically
The male to female ratio of the Honduran population is
This ratio stands at at birth from to years old from to years old from to years old and for those years or older
The Gender Development Index GDI was in with an HDI of for females and for males
Life expectancy at birth for males is and for females
Expected years of schooling in Honduras is years for males mean of and for females mean of
These measures do not reveal a large disparity between male and female development levels however GNI per capita is vastly different by gender
Males have a GNI per capita of while that of females is only
Honduras's overall GDI is higher than that of other medium HDI nations but lower than the overall HDI for Latin America and the Caribbean
The United Nations Development Program UNDP ranks Honduras th for measures including women's political power and female access to resources
The Gender Inequality Index GII depicts gender-based inequalities in Honduras according to reproductive health empowerment and economic activity
Honduras has a GII of and ranked of countries in
of Honduras's parliament is female and of adult females have a secondary education or higher while only of adult males do
Despite this while male participation in the labor market is female participation is
Honduras's maternal mortality ratio is and the adolescent birth rate is for women ages
Familialism and machismo carry a lot of weight within Honduran society
Familialism refers to the idea of individual interests being second to that of the family most often in relation to dating and marriage abstinence and parental approval and supervision of dating
Aggression and proof of masculinity through physical dominance are characteristic of machismo
Honduras has historically functioned with a patriarchal system like many other Latin American countries
Honduran men claim responsibility for family decisions including reproductive health decisions
Recently Honduras has seen an increase in challenges to this notion as feminist movements and access to global media increases
There has been an increase in educational attainment labor force participating urban migration late-age marriage and contraceptive use amongst Honduran women
Between and Honduran total fertility rate decreased from births to births
This is largely attributable to an increase in educational attainment and workforce participation by women as well as more widespread use of contraceptives
In of women were using at least one type of contraceptive
By were largely due to female sterilization birth control in the form of a pill injectable birth control and IUDs
A study done in of Honduran men and women reflect conceptualization of reproductive health and decision making in Honduras
of men and of women surveyed believed men were responsible for decisions regarding family size and family planning uses
of men believed men were responsible for both
Sexual violence against women has proven to be a large issue in Honduras that has caused many to migrate to the US
The prevalence of child sexual abuse was in Honduras with the majority of reports being from children under the age of
Women that experienced sexual abuse as children were found to be twice as likely to be in violent relationships
In of unaccompanied refugee minors were female
