in december jackson was awarded a star on the hollywood walk of fame
jackson was born on october in wellington
and was raised in its far northern suburb of pukerua bay
his parents joan n e ruck a factory worker and housewife and william bill jackson a wages clerk were emigrants from england
as a child jackson was a keen film fan growing up on ray harryhausen films as well as finding inspiration in the television series thunderbirds and monty python s flying circus
after a family friend gave the jacksons a super cine camera with peter in mind he began making short films with his friends
jackson has long cited king kong as his favourite film and around the age of nine he attempted to remake it using his own stop motion models
also as a child jackson made a world war ii epic called the dwarf patrol seen on the bad taste bonus disc which featured his first special effect of poking pinholes in the film for gun shots and a james bond spoof named coldfinger
most notable though was a minute short called the valley which won him a special prize because of the shots he used
in school jackson expressed no interest in sports
his classmates also remember him wearing a duffel coat with an obsession verging on religious
he had no formal training in film making but learned about editing special effects and make up largely through his own trial and error
as a young adult jackson discovered the work of author j
tolkien after watching the lord of the rings an animated film by ralph bakshi that was a part adaptation of tolkien s fantasy trilogy
when he was years old jackson left school and began working full time as a photo engraver for a wellington newspaper the evening post
for the seven years he worked there jackson lived at home with his parents so he could save as much money as possible to spend on film equipment
after two years of work jackson bought a mm camera and began shooting a film that later became bad taste
jackson has long cited several films as influences
it is well known that jackson has a passion for king kong often citing it as his favourite film and as the film that inspired him early in his life
jackson recalls attempting to remake king kong when he was nine
at the san diego comic con international while being interviewed alongside avatar and titanic director james cameron jackson said certain films gave him a kick
he mentioned martin scorsese s crime films goodfellas and casino remarking on something about those particular movies and the way martin scorsese just fearlessly rockets his camera around and has shot those films that i can watch those movies and feel inspired jackson said the film waterloo inspired him in his youth
other influences include george romero sam raimi and the special effects by ray harryhausen
jackson s first feature was bad taste a haphazard fashion splatter comedy which took years to make it included many of jackson s friends acting and working on it for free
shooting was normally done in the weekends since jackson was then working full time
bad taste is about aliens that come to earth with the intention of turning humans into food
jackson had two acting roles including a famous scene in which he fights himself on top of a cliff
the film was finally completed thanks to a late injection of finance from the new zealand film commission after jim booth the body s executive director became convinced of jackson s talent booth later left the commission to become jackson s producer
in may bad taste was unveiled at the cannes film festival where rights to the film quickly sold to twelve countries
around this time jackson began working on writing a number of film scripts in varied collaborative groupings with playwright stephen sinclair writer fran walsh and writer actor danny mulheron
walsh would later become his life partner
some of the scripts from this period including a sequel to a nightmare on elm street have never been made into movies the proposed zombie film braindead underwent extensive rewrites
jackson s next film to see release was meet the feebles co written with sinclair walsh and mulheron
an ensemble musical comedy starring muppet style puppets meet the feebles originally began as a short film intended for television but was rapidly expanded into a full length film after unanticipated enthusiasm from japanese investors and the collapse of braindead six weeks before filming
begun on a very low budget meet the feebles went weeks over schedule
jackson stated of his second feature length film it s got a quality of humour that alienates a lot of people
it s very black very satirical very savage feebles marked jackson s first collaboration with special effects team richard taylor and tania rodger who would later work on all jackson s movies
jackson s next release was the horror comedy braindead released in north america as dead alive
released in after jackson won a race to bring the story to the screen heavenly creatures marked a major change for jackson in terms of both style and tone
the film is based on the real parker hulme murder case in which two teenage girls in s christchurch became close friends and later murdered the mother of one of the girls
it was fran walsh that persuaded him that these events had the makings of a movie jackson has been quoted saying that the film only got made because of her enthusiasm for the subject matter
the film s fame coincided with the new zealand media tracking down the real life juliet hulme who now writes books under the name anne perry
jackson hired actresses melanie lynskey and kate winslet in the roles of parker and hulme
heavenly creatures received considerable critical acclaim including an academy award nomination for best original screenplay and making top ten of the year lists in time the guardian the sydney morning herald and the new zealand herald
the success of heavenly creatures won jackson attention from us company miramax who promoted the film vigorously in america and signed the director to a first look deal
the following year in collaboration with wellington film maker costa botes jackson co directed the mockumentary forgotten silver
this ambitious made for television piece told the story of new zealand film pioneer colin mckenzie who had supposedly invented colour film and talkies and attempted an epic film of salome before being forgotten by the world
though the programme played in a slot normally reserved for drama no other warning was given that it was fictionalised and many viewers were outraged at discovering colin mckenzie had never existed
the number of people who believed the increasingly improbable story provides testimony to jackson and botes skill at playing on new zealand s national myth of a nation of innovators and forgotten trail blazers
the success of heavenly creatures helped pave the way for jackson s first big budget hollywood film the frighteners starring michael j
fox in
jackson was given permission to make this comedy horror film entirely in new zealand despite being set in a north american town
this period was a key one of change for both jackson and weta workshop the special effects company born from the one man contributions of george port to heavenly creatures with which jackson is often associated
weta initiated by jackson and key collaborators grew rapidly during this period to incorporate both digital and physical effects make up and costumes the first two areas normally commanded by jackson collaborator richard taylor
the frighteners was regarded as a box office failure
film critic roger ebert expressed disappointment stating that incredible effort has resulted in a film that looks more like a demo reel than a movie
in february jackson launched legal proceedings against the new zealand listener magazine for defamation over a review of the frighteners which claimed that the film was built from the rubble of other people s movies
in the end the case was not pursued further
around this time jackson s remake of king kong was shelved by universal studios partly because of mighty joe young and godzilla both giant monster movies that had already gone into production
universal feared it would be thrown aside by the two higher budget movies
this period of transition seems not to have been entirely a happy one it also marked one of the high points of tension between jackson and the new zealand film commission since meet the feebles had gone over budget earlier in his career
jackson has claimed the commission considered firing him from feebles though the nzfc went on to help fund his next three films
in the director submitted a lengthy criticism of the commission for a magazine supplement meant to celebrate the body s th anniversary criticising what he called inconsistent decision making by inexperienced board members
the magazine felt that the material was too long and potentially defamatory to publish in that form a shortened version of the material went on to appear in metro magazine
in the metro article jackson criticized the commission over funding decisions concerning a film he was hoping to executive produce but refused to drop a client confidentiality provision that would have allowed them to publicly reply to his criticisms
jackson won the rights to film tolkien s epic in after meeting with producer saul zaentz
originally working with miramax films towards a two film production jackson was later pressured to render the story as a single film and finally overcame a tight deadline by making a last minute deal with new line who were keen on a trilogy
principal photography stretched from october to december with extensive location filming across new zealand
with the benefit of extended post production and extra periods of shooting before each film s release the series met with huge success and sent jackson s popularity soaring
the return of the king itself met with huge critical acclaim winning all eleven oscars it was nominated for including best picture and best director
the film was the first of the fantasy film genre to win the award for best picture and was the second sequel to win best picture the first being the godfather part ii
jackson s mother joan died three days before the release of the first movie in the trilogy the fellowship of the ring
there was a special showing of the film after her funeral
universal studios signed jackson for a second time to remake the classic king kong the film that inspired him to become a film director as a child
he was reportedly paid a fee of us million upfront the highest salary ever paid to date to a film director in advance of production against a percent take of the box office rentals the portion of the price of the ticket that goes to the film distributor in this case universal
the film was released on december to critical acclaim and grossed around us million worldwide
he also collaborated with game designer michel ancel from ubisoft to make a video game adaptation of the film which released november and was also a critical and commercial success

jackson has said the film was a welcome relief from his larger scale epics
the storyline s combination of fantasy aspects and themes of murder share some similarities with heavenly creatures
the film ended up receiving generally mixed reviews and middling box office returns yet earned stanley tucci an academy award for best supporting actor nomination
jackson was one of three producers on the adventures of tintin the secret of the unicorn directed by steven spielberg and released in
he is officially credited as producer but before he began working on the hobbit helped spielberg direct the film
jamie bell and andy serkis were cast due to their collaboration with peter jackson on king kong and the lord of the rings
spielberg chose to work with peter jackson due to the impressive digital work on the lord of the rings films and knew peter jackson s company weta digital would make his vision a reality

in june spielberg confirmed that the sequel was still in development but jackson is working on a secret project in the meantime
jackson s involvement in the making of a film version of the hobbit has a long and chequered history
in november a letter from peter jackson and fran walsh stated that due to an ongoing legal dispute between wingnut films jackson s production company and new line cinema jackson would not be directing the film
new line cinema s head robert shaye commented that jackson will never make any movie with new line cinema again while i m still working at the company
this prompted an online call for a boycott of new line cinema and by august shaye was trying to repair his working relationship
on december it was announced that jackson and new line cinema had reached agreement to make two prequels both based on the hobbit and to be released in and with jackson as a writer and executive producer and guillermo del toro directing

jackson himself whose own grandfather fought in the war and to whom the film is co dedicated said before the screening this is not a story of the first world war it is not a historical story it may not even be entirely accurate but it s the memories of the men who fought they re just giving their impressions of what it was like to be a soldier
reviewing the film for the guardian critic peter bradshaw said
to mark the centenary of the first world war s end peter jackson has created a visually staggering thought experiment an immersive deep dive into what it was like for ordinary british soldiers on the western front
this he has done using state of the art digital technology to restore flickery old black and white archive footage of the servicemen s life in training and in the trenches
he has colourised it sharpened it put it in d and as well as using diaries and letters for narrative voiceover he has used lip readers to help dub in what the men are actually saying the effect is electrifying
