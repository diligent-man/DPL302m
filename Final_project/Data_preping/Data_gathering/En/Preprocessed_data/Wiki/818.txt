College ice hockey is played principally in the United States and Canada though leagues exist outside North America
In the United States competitive college hockey refers to ice hockey played between colleges and universities within the governance structure established by the National Collegiate Athletic Association NCAA
In Canada the term college hockey refers to community college and small college ice hockey that currently consists of a varsity conference the Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference ACAC and a club league the British Columbia Intercollegiate Hockey League BCIHL University hockey is the term used for hockey primarily played at four year institutions that level of the sport is governed by U Sports
In fall of Malcolm Greene Chace then a Freshman at Brown University and Robert Wrenn of Harvard University were participating in a tennis tournament in Niagara Falls Ontario They both had dabbled a bit in a sport called ice polo in Ontario they met members of the Victoria Hockey Club who introduced them to their similar game of ice hockey and invited the two to visit Montreal to learn about their version of the game
The next winter during Christmas break Chace who had by then transferred to Yale University and Wrenn returned to Canada with a group of college students from several universities in tow The cadre was one of the first American ice hockey teams and after a game tour of Canada the students returned to their respective schools with the intent of founding collegiate ice hockey clubs
Yale where Chace served as team captain and player coach was the first of the group to organize its team and in February the Bulldogs played the first two intercollegiate ice hockey games against Johns Hopkins University While Johns Hopkins' program would cease for years after Yale has served as a bedrock of college hockey ever since playing continually for seasons as of including through the Great Depression and two world wars
Another game often cited as the first game of intercollegiate ice hockey played in the United States is a well documented contest on January at Franklin Park Boston Students from Brown took the train to Boston where they commandeered a patch of a frozen pond in Franklin Park asked pleasure skaters to give them room and played students from Harvard The details and outcome of the game were recorded in the following day's Boston Herald Brown Harvard
Within ten years all eight schools that would eventually comprise the Ivy League had played their first game as well as several other nearby teams A lack of available ice was the primary concern for most schools as to whether they should start a program or continue supporting an existing team but that did not detract from the enthusiasm of the student bodies
For at least the first years of intercollegiate play the teams used a on format a typical setup for turn of the century ice hockey On a faceoff players were typically arranged as either four forwards two point men and one goaltender or three forwards one rover two point men and one goaltender
In the four forward setup the players were arranged from a faceoff as a left and right wing or end on the outside and a left and right center on the inside The two point men and goaltender were typically arrayed in a line from center ice to the goal as cover point point and goaltender If viewed from above the players would form a ' T '
If a rover was used instead there would only be one center The rover would line up either in a defensive or offensive position depending on the need The remaining five positions would be unchanged By the season college hockey adopted the increasingly more common aside format with the abandonment of the second center rover position and the two point men being renamed as 'defensemen' The change from point men to defensemen comes as a result of an alignment change where instead of lining up one in front of the other the two defensive players would play beside one another
The ice surfaces that the players played on were not of a uniform size Rinks like the St Nicholas Rink or Duquesne Gardens were few and far between and quite often teams would only be able to play on frozen ponds Slightly more consistent were the length of games however there was no set game time Most were played as two minute halves but some games had or minute halves and others were one minute period Occasionally games were not able to be played entirely at one time so the teams would arrange to meet at a later date to finish the match Overtime after a tie did not always occur as ice times at public skating rinks were constrained but even when teams were able to play extra frames the rules were somewhat flexible because there were no lights illuminating the ponds games could only be played while the sun was shining and in the winter months dusk came quickly The teams would attempt to finish the game with a winner decided but even after multiple overtimes ties did result
From the start college hockey teams were rarely in a place of surety In the years since Johns Hopkins' exit in at least a dozen teams were forced to cancel seasons or suspend their program entirely including some of the more financially sound institutions like Cornell University and Brown University The two main factors in this were interest from the student body and the lack of available or good ice While the interest conundrum required a more nuanced solution the ice troubles had a more tangible answer Teams near to public skating rinks would be able to hold their games at venues where ice conditions could be ensured but at the start with so few available some programs came up with novel solutions One such idea came from Harvard University who after completing construction of their football stadium in decided to erect two open air rinks on the field for the team to use
As rinks continued to be built in areas near to the colleges specifically the Boston Arena New Haven Arena and Philadelphia Ice Palace college teams had more and more ice rinks available to them and with most using artificial ice the teams were no longer dependent on weather conditions Owing to the popularity of the game the first on campus purpose built arena was constructed by Princeton University in Most schools were content with buying ice time from local rink operators while others simply didn't want to fund the building of their own version of the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink As the weather warmed in the s and s many of these teams would be forced to decide whether they were willing to financially support their ice hockey programs or not Army for instance had Smith Rink built in while Cornell struggled with the ice on Beebe Lake until after World War II
The vast majority of teams ceased operating in after the United States entered World War I This made sense as many of the students who would otherwise have been playing had instead joined the military Because the war ended in November many of the teams returned to the ice for the season and while the game continued to grow around New England an interesting development happened shortly after the armistice was signed
Colleges in the midwest began their own ice hockey programs At the beginning these were typically restricted to upper echelon universities like the University of Minnesota or the University of Michigan but some of the smaller schools got into the game as well From the MIAC's foundation in member schools have played ice hockey and were able to establish the first consistent lower tier competition in college hockey
While college ice hockey flourished in the s the Great Depression did have an impact on the game in the ' s Most schools that had established programs made the effort to keep their teams going but some less acclaimed teams like Pennsylvania or Columbia decided that ice hockey wasn't worth the cost Some of the smaller schools like Rensselaer had no choice but to suspend their programs as they did not have the resources that a Harvard or Yale did After the first half of the s however the depression lessened and schools were able to found or restart their programs The game continued to expand west with the addition of Gonzaga USC UCLA and others however none of the Pacific coast teams would make it to the s
As had happened during the first world war the majority of universities suspended their ice hockey teams during World War II Most of teams that were active just prior to the U S ' entry played during the season but were mothballed afterwards There were notable exceptions such as Yale and Dartmouth who continued to play through the duration of the war but many teams returned to the ice for an abbreviated season One benefit to college hockey that resulted from the war was the G I Bill which helped returning servicemen pay for a college education With a much larger student body and a resulting influx in cash colleges were more able to afford to support an ice hockey team
By college ice hockey was still a regional sport being localized in the northeast and northern Midwest with a few exceptions but despite the low number of teams playing the NCAA finally instituted a national tournament At the start the tournament invited two participants from the two regions east and west The east region was loosely defined as any college east of the Pennsylvania Ohio border with all other teams being lumped into the west region The tournament was held at the Broadmoor World Arena for the first ten years Partially due to a lack of competition Michigan was invited to participate in each of the first ten tournaments and won six National Championships in that time

The NCAA Division I Championship is a team single elimination tournament divided into four team regional tournaments The winner of each regional advances to the Frozen Four to compete for the national championship For many years teams earned automatic bids through winning conference tournament championships while earned at large berths through a selection committee With the addition of the Big Ten hockey conference for the season the tournament now features automatic qualifiers and at large bids The ranking system that is used to determine the at large teams is known as the Pairwise Rankings which uses a number of ranking factors to create a scoring system for all NCAA Division I teams
In schools were initially set to compete in Division I with of them organized into six conferences plus two teams Arizona State and LIU playing as independent programs initially with no conference affiliation However these two programs later entered into scheduling alliances with the Big Ten Conference and Atlantic Hockey respectively due to the effects of the COVID pandemic Additionally several of the other conference aligned schools most notably all six Ivy League members that field varsity men's teams chose not to compete in that season also due to COVID concerns
As of the most recent season the conferences are
National Collegiate Hockey ConferenceThe CCHA the revival of a league that had operated from to before folding in the aftermath of major conference realignment initially consisted of seven schools that had previously competed in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association These schools had announced in late that they would leave the WCHA after the season and subsequently announced that they would operate as a new CCHA In July the new CCHA added an eighth member in St Thomas a Twin Cities institution set to make an unprecedented move from NCAA Division III directly to Division I

The most recent addition to D I men's ice hockey is the aforementioned St Thomas After the end of the school year St Thomas was expelled from its longtime D III home of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference due to perceptions by most other league members that it had grown too strong for the conference The Summit League a D I all sports league that does not sponsor hockey soon issued the school an invitation and worked with the school to obtain a waiver of an NCAA rule that would have otherwise prevented a direct move to D I Shortly after St Thomas' D I move was confirmed it was unveiled as the eighth member of the revived CCHA
Prior to St Thomas the most recent addition to D I men's ice hockey had been LIU which added the sport in While LIU played its first season as an independent it was a scheduling partner of Atlantic Hockey Before this announcement some media outlets had reported that LIU had sought membership in that league
