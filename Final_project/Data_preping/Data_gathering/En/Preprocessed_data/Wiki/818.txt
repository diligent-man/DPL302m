college ice hockey is played principally in the united states and canada though leagues exist outside north america
in the united states competitive college hockey refers to ice hockey played between colleges and universities within the governance structure established by the national collegiate athletic association ncaa
in canada the term college hockey refers to community college and small college ice hockey that currently consists of a varsity conference the alberta colleges athletic conference acac and a club league the british columbia intercollegiate hockey league bcihl
university hockey is the term used for hockey primarily played at four year institutions that level of the sport is governed by u sports
in fall of malcolm greene chace then a freshman at brown university and robert wrenn of harvard university were participating in a tennis tournament in niagara falls ontario
they both had dabbled a bit in a sport called ice polo in ontario they met members of the victoria hockey club who introduced them to their similar game of ice hockey and invited the two to visit montreal to learn about their version of the game
the next winter during christmas break chace who had by then transferred to yale university and wrenn returned to canada with a group of college students from several universities in tow
the cadre was one of the first american ice hockey teams and after a game tour of canada the students returned to their respective schools with the intent of founding collegiate ice hockey clubs
yale where chace served as team captain and player coach was the first of the group to organize its team and in february the bulldogs played the first two intercollegiate ice hockey games against johns hopkins university
while johns hopkins program would cease for years after yale has served as a bedrock of college hockey ever since playing continually for seasons as of including through the great depression and two world wars
another game often cited as the first game of intercollegiate ice hockey played in the united states is a well documented contest on january at franklin park boston
students from brown took the train to boston where they commandeered a patch of a frozen pond in franklin park asked pleasure skaters to give them room and played students from harvard
the details and outcome of the game were recorded in the following day s boston herald brown harvard
within ten years all eight schools that would eventually comprise the ivy league had played their first game as well as several other nearby teams
a lack of available ice was the primary concern for most schools as to whether they should start a program or continue supporting an existing team but that did not detract from the enthusiasm of the student bodies
for at least the first years of intercollegiate play the teams used a on format a typical setup for turn of the century ice hockey
on a faceoff players were typically arranged as either four forwards two point men and one goaltender or three forwards one rover two point men and one goaltender
in the four forward setup the players were arranged from a faceoff as a left and right wing or end on the outside and a left and right center on the inside
the two point men and goaltender were typically arrayed in a line from center ice to the goal as cover point point and goaltender
if viewed from above the players would form a t
if a rover was used instead there would only be one center
the rover would line up either in a defensive or offensive position depending on the need
the remaining five positions would be unchanged
by the season college hockey adopted the increasingly more common aside format with the abandonment of the second center rover position and the two point men being renamed as defensemen
the change from point men to defensemen comes as a result of an alignment change where instead of lining up one in front of the other the two defensive players would play beside one another
the ice surfaces that the players played on were not of a uniform size
rinks like the st
nicholas rink or duquesne gardens were few and far between and quite often teams would only be able to play on frozen ponds
slightly more consistent were the length of games however there was no set game time
most were played as two minute halves but some games had or minute halves and others were one minute period
occasionally games were not able to be played entirely at one time so the teams would arrange to meet at a later date to finish the match
overtime after a tie did not always occur as ice times at public skating rinks were constrained but even when teams were able to play extra frames the rules were somewhat flexible because there were no lights illuminating the ponds games could only be played while the sun was shining and in the winter months dusk came quickly
the teams would attempt to finish the game with a winner decided but even after multiple overtimes ties did result
from the start college hockey teams were rarely in a place of surety
in the years since johns hopkins exit in at least a dozen teams were forced to cancel seasons or suspend their program entirely including some of the more financially sound institutions like cornell university and brown university
the two main factors in this were interest from the student body and the lack of available or good ice
while the interest conundrum required a more nuanced solution the ice troubles had a more tangible answer
teams near to public skating rinks would be able to hold their games at venues where ice conditions could be ensured but at the start with so few available some programs came up with novel solutions
one such idea came from harvard university who after completing construction of their football stadium in decided to erect two open air rinks on the field for the team to use
as rinks continued to be built in areas near to the colleges specifically the boston arena new haven arena and philadelphia ice palace college teams had more and more ice rinks available to them and with most using artificial ice the teams were no longer dependent on weather conditions
owing to the popularity of the game the first on campus purpose built arena was constructed by princeton university in
most schools were content with buying ice time from local rink operators while others simply didn t want to fund the building of their own version of the hobey baker memorial rink
as the weather warmed in the s and s many of these teams would be forced to decide whether they were willing to financially support their ice hockey programs or not
army for instance had smith rink built in while cornell struggled with the ice on beebe lake until after world war ii
the vast majority of teams ceased operating in after the united states entered world war i
this made sense as many of the students who would otherwise have been playing had instead joined the military
because the war ended in november many of the teams returned to the ice for the season and while the game continued to grow around new england an interesting development happened shortly after the armistice was signed
colleges in the midwest began their own ice hockey programs
at the beginning these were typically restricted to upper echelon universities like the university of minnesota or the university of michigan but some of the smaller schools got into the game as well
from the miac s foundation in member schools have played ice hockey and were able to establish the first consistent lower tier competition in college hockey
while college ice hockey flourished in the s the great depression did have an impact on the game in the s
most schools that had established programs made the effort to keep their teams going but some less acclaimed teams like pennsylvania or columbia decided that ice hockey wasn t worth the cost
some of the smaller schools like rensselaer had no choice but to suspend their programs as they did not have the resources that a harvard or yale did
after the first half of the s however the depression lessened and schools were able to found or restart their programs
the game continued to expand west with the addition of gonzaga usc ucla and others however none of the pacific coast teams would make it to the s
as had happened during the first world war the majority of universities suspended their ice hockey teams during world war ii
most of teams that were active just prior to the u s entry played during the season but were mothballed afterwards
there were notable exceptions such as yale and dartmouth who continued to play through the duration of the war but many teams returned to the ice for an abbreviated season
one benefit to college hockey that resulted from the war was the g i
bill which helped returning servicemen pay for a college education
with a much larger student body and a resulting influx in cash colleges were more able to afford to support an ice hockey team
by college ice hockey was still a regional sport being localized in the northeast and northern midwest with a few exceptions but despite the low number of teams playing the ncaa finally instituted a national tournament
at the start the tournament invited two participants from the two regions east and west
the east region was loosely defined as any college east of the pennsylvania ohio border with all other teams being lumped into the west region
the tournament was held at the broadmoor world arena for the first ten years
partially due to a lack of competition michigan was invited to participate in each of the first ten tournaments and won six national championships in that time
the national collegiate athletic association has conducted national championships for men s ice hockey since and women s ice hockey since
college hockey players must be deemed eligible for ncaa competition by the ncaa eligibility center a process that examines a student athlete s academic qualifications and amateur status
players who have participated in the canadian hockey league or any professional hockey league are considered ineligible
men s u s
college hockey is a feeder system to the national hockey league
as of the season percent of nhl players a total of had u s
college hockey experience prior to turning professional an increase of percent from the previous years
that percentage has been maintained the past three seasons with a record nhl players coming from college hockey in
one hundred thirty eight colleges and universities sponsor men s ice hockey in the ncaa s three divisions
ncaa division i has ice hockey teams in the season two fewer than in
of these schools are division ii or iii athletic programs that play up to division i in hockey and of the full division i members are in the football bowl subdivision
seven of the fbs schools compete in the big ten conference six are full conference members and the seventh is a single sport member
the ncaa division i championship is a team single elimination tournament divided into four team regional tournaments
the winner of each regional advances to the frozen four to compete for the national championship
for many years teams earned automatic bids through winning conference tournament championships while earned at large berths through a selection committee
with the addition of the big ten hockey conference for the season the tournament now features automatic qualifiers and at large bids
the ranking system that is used to determine the at large teams is known as the pairwise rankings which uses a number of ranking factors to create a scoring system for all ncaa division i teams
in schools were initially set to compete in division i with of them organized into six conferences plus two teams arizona state and liu playing as independent programs initially with no conference affiliation
however these two programs later entered into scheduling alliances with the big ten conference and atlantic hockey respectively due to the effects of the covid pandemic
additionally several of the other conference aligned schools most notably all six ivy league members that field varsity men s teams chose not to compete in that season also due to covid concerns
as of the most recent season the conferences are
atlantic hockey association
big ten conference
central collegiate hockey association
ecac hockey
hockey east association
national collegiate hockey conferencethe ccha the revival of a league that had operated from to before folding in the aftermath of major conference realignment initially consisted of seven schools that had previously competed in the western collegiate hockey association
these schools had announced in late that they would leave the wcha after the season and subsequently announced that they would operate as a new ccha
in july the new ccha added an eighth member in st
thomas a twin cities institution set to make an unprecedented move from ncaa division iii directly to division i
as for the wcha it folded its men s division
not only did the aforementioned group of seven schools leave to form the revived ccha but an eighth men s member alaska anchorage had announced it would drop hockey plus two other sports after the school year
still another men s member alabama huntsville uah had also filed papers to leave after the season then dropped the sport entirely due to fallout from covid but soon reinstated the sport following a successful fundraising drive led by uah hockey alumni
this reprieve proved temporary as the school and its hockey supporters agreed that the continuation of the sport beyond would be contingent on finding a new conference home when no conference move materialized the hockey program was dropped again although uah officially called the move a suspension
the other remaining wcha men s member was alaska representing the fairbanks campus of the university of alaska it chose to continue play as a d i independent
the ivy league recognizes ice hockey champions for both sexes but it does not sponsor the sport it instead uses the results of regular season ecac hockey matches involving two ivy league schools to extrapolate an ivy champion all six ivy league schools that sponsor varsity hockey do so for both men and women and compete in the ecac
the metro atlantic athletic conference sponsored d i men s hockey but dropped the sport in
the most recent addition to d i men s ice hockey is the aforementioned st
thomas
after the end of the school year st
thomas was expelled from its longtime d iii home of the minnesota intercollegiate athletic conference due to perceptions by most other league members that it had grown too strong for the conference
the summit league a d i all sports league that does not sponsor hockey soon issued the school an invitation and worked with the school to obtain a waiver of an ncaa rule that would have otherwise prevented a direct move to d i
shortly after st
thomas d i move was confirmed it was unveiled as the eighth member of the revived ccha
prior to st
thomas the most recent addition to d i men s ice hockey had been liu which added the sport in
while liu played its first season as an independent it was a scheduling partner of atlantic hockey
before this announcement some media outlets had reported that liu had sought membership in that league
in may tennessee state university announced that it was conducting a feasibility study on the possible addition of varsity men s and women s hockey teams
should tsu add either team it would become the first historically black university to field a varsity hockey team
the study is partially backed by the nhl and the nashville predators located in tsu s home city
three schools dropped men s ice hockey after the season the aforementioned alabama huntsville and alaska anchorage plus robert morris
since then both alaska anchorage and robert morris have announced that that they will reinstate men s hockey following successful fundraising drives
uaa plans to resume play in and robert morris in
on september it was announced that augustana university in sioux falls south dakota would be adding an ncaa division i men s hockey team to begin play in the season
the hobey baker memorial award honors the top player in men s division i hockey
the mike richter award honors the top goaltender in division i
the ncaa does not currently sponsor a championship in division ii as there is only one conference that currently sponsors hockey the northeast conference
the ncaa conducted a division ii national championship from to and also from to
the programs in division iii hockey are part of nine conferences
commonwealth coast conference
massachusetts state college athletic conference
minnesota intercollegiate athletic conference
new england hockey conference
new england small college athletic conference
northern collegiate hockey association
state university of new york athletic conference
united collegiate hockey conference
wisconsin intercollegiate athletic conferencethe middle atlantic conference officially sponsors men s and women s ice hockey but does not hold a conference tournament
instead in a relationship similar to that between the ivy league and ecac hockey all mac hockey schools are members of the uchc and the mac uses regular season results of games between mac members to extrapolate a mac champion
mac members compete for the uchc s automatic ncaa tournament berth
the ncaa has conducted a division iii national championship since
the current championship format is a team formerly team single elimination bracket
there are colleges and universities that sponsor women s ice hockey in two divisions national collegiate and division iii
as of the most recent season teams compete in the national collegiate division commonly referred to as division i
all of them play in five conferences
college hockey america cha
ecac hockey
hockey east
new england women s hockey alliance newha
western collegiate hockey association wcha the wcha remains in operation as a women s league despite the demise of the conference s men s side
the national collegiate championship is an team single elimination tournament to determine the national champion
the patty kazmaier memorial award is awarded annually by usa hockey to the top player in women s division i hockey
thomas which joined the wcha in is the most recent school to add varsity women s hockey at this level moving its existing team from division iii
the wcha also worked with st
thomas in its bid to gain d i membership
the next school to start national collegiate play is stonehill which will add the sport in and join the newha
the school had originally planned to start play as a newha member in but decided to wait a year because of recruiting restrictions brought on by covid
also as noted previously tennessee state is conducting a feasibility study on adding men s and women s hockey
robert morris which dropped men s hockey after the season also dropped women s hockey at the same time
this leaves cha with only five members one fewer than the six needed to maintain its automatic ncaa tournament berth
the conference had two years to bring its membership back to the required six members before losing its automatic bid
rmu has since announced that women s hockey will return in and has been readmitted to cha restoring the league s membership to the required six
the newest national collegiate conference is the newha formed in as a scheduling alliance between the then current national collegiate independents
it formally organized as a conference in and received ncaa recognition in
there are teams in division iii in eight conferences
colonial hockey conference
ecac west
minnesota intercollegiate athletic conference
new england hockey conference
new england small college athletic conference
northern collegiate hockey association
united collegiate hockey conference
wisconsin intercollegiate athletic conferenceas noted previously the middle atlantic conference sponsors women s ice hockey but does not hold a conference tournament
all of its hockey members compete for the uchc s automatic tournament berth and the mac champion is extrapolated from regular season results of games between mac members
the division iii championship is a team single elimination tournament to determine the national champion
university hockey teams in canada compete in leagues as part of u sports the national governing body for canadian university athletics in canadian english the term college is reserved for schools that would be called junior community or technical colleges in the u s
u sports sponsors both men s and women s hockey
like in the united states teams compete in athletic conferences based on geographical locations of the schools
unlike the ncaa u sports does not award players with athletic scholarships resulting in a lack of divisional separation such as found between ncaa divisions
individual conferences hold postseason tournaments followed by the round robin u sports championship tournament in late march
in a group of member schools in the national association of intercollegiate athletics naia began working to add the sport to the organization
the naia originally sponsored a men s ice hockey championship from to when it was discontinued due to many of the schools with teams leaving the naia for the ncaa
a few naia schools continued to sponsor the sport as varsity club teams in the acha
a growing number of schools have added ice hockey as members of the acha over the past years
in several naia institutions that sponsor men s ice hockey teams announced the formation of a coaches association and a new division for naia ice hockey program to begin play during the season
in the wolverine hoosier athletic conference whac became the first current conference in the naia to offer the sport and host a conference championship
the american collegiate hockey association acha is the sanctioning body for non ncaa or club ice hockey in the united states
the organization provides structure regulations and promotes the quality of collegiate ice hockey
teams separated into three men s and two women s divisions with over teams from across the united states
the recruiting process rules and regulations and player eligibility standards parallel that of ncaa division iii
sometimes acha and ncaa will play games against each other to complete each of their season schedules
