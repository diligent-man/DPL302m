The strongly anticommunist film produced during the height of McCarthyism received an Oscar nomination for Best Writing Motion Picture Story The nomination was later viewed as a possible attempt by the motion picture industry to signal its loyalty to the ongoing anticommunist campaign Retrospective reviews have characterized it as a propaganda film indicative of attitudes during the Second Red Scare

The film was based on an idea by Leo McCarey and developed into a script by John Lee Mahin Paramount built interest in the project by reporting the casting of each role beginning with the news in December that Helen Hayes was considering it for her return to motion pictures after years away from the film industry The details of the story were kept secret while it was first described in one news report as a contemporary drama about the relationship between a mother and son described by McCarey as 'highly emotional but with much humor' Hedda Hopper reported that the script has gotten raves from everyone who's read it
Despite McCarey's close mouthed silence for two months and a public warning to Hayes not to discuss the plot it was reported that word has gotten around Hollywood with the authority such wisps of information always have that the son is a traitor to his country an agent of Communist espionage Daily Variety reported that Hayes mirroring certain current events would shoot her son in the film and be tried for his murder Hayes called it a natural human part for which she did not have to worry about her appearance She denied that the film's message attracted her to the project I just like the character and the story I am deadly set against messages as the prime factor for taking a part But I do feel the picture is a very exciting comment on a certain phase of our living today
In February Robert Walker was borrowed from MGM to play the title role That same month Dean Jagger signed Van Heflin signed in April
Ten days into shooting the plot's unknown elements continued to garner press coverage McCarey denied that the script was the Alger Hiss story and said that it had a happy ending He said
An scene with Van Heflin delivering the speech at the end of the film was shot at the Wilshire Ebell Theater in Los Angeles but the script was rewritten so that Robert Walker would perform the speech instead However Walker died on August less than a week after completing principal photography on the film and only a few hours after recording the audio for the ending speech Because Walker was unavailable for the reshoots for the scene the script was changed so that Walker's character would be killed before the commencement with a recording of his speech to be played along with a shot of Walker from Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train for the death scene The shots of the audience from the originally filmed ending were used in the final film with new shots of the recording playing from an empty lectern
Filming took place in Washington DC Manassas Virginia and Hollywood
The picture was not a success at the box office It grossed under million and failed to make the list of the top pictures of the year as compiled by Variety
Bosley Crowther wrote in his review for The New York Times that the film represented its time perfectly in that it corresponds with the present public ferment of angry resentment and fear and that it is a picture so strongly dedicated to the purpose of the American anti Communist purge that it seethes with the sort of emotionalism and illogic that is characteristic of so much thinking these days He wrote that allowing a mother to condemn her son based on flimsy evidence shows the film's hot emotional nature and that its endorsement of bigotry and argument for religious conformity would cause a thoughtful person to feel a shudder of apprehension While praising all of the actors Crowther regretted the film's snide anti intellectual stance Soon after the film opened Crowther noted that My Son John provided an ironic contrast to the public outcry about communist subversion in the film industry on the part of the American Legion and the Catholic War Veterans He wrote
Other critics underscored the cultural attitudes behind the film's politics In the New York Herald Tribune Ogden Reid later a congressman wrote McCarey's picture of how America ought to be is so frightening so speciously argued so full of warnings against an intelligent solution to the problem that it boomerangs upon its own cause
The New Yorker wrote that the film advised the public to cut out thinking obey their superiors blindly regard all political suspects as guilty without trial revel in joy through strength and pay more attention to football
Others have appreciated that the film locates the ideological conflict within a complex set of family relations with father and son competing for the same woman's affection but noted that John is not just intellectual but an unathletic sexually ambiguous intellectual both sullen and slick Others have interpreted John's character as homosexual
In response to negative reviews from the New York critics the Catholic Press Institute unanimously endorsed a resolution praising the film and Senator Karl Mundt entered a statement into the Congressional Record calling it undoubtedly the greatest and most stirring pro American motion picture of the last decade It should be seen by the people of every American home McCarey told the magazine Motion Picture that he felt mistreated and hurt
A month after the film opened the Catholic Press Association awarded McCarey its Literary Prize for exemplification of Christian Catholic principles citing his work on My Son John and other films
In Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top
Patricia Bosworth writing about a festival of blacklist era films in characterized My Son John as hysterical and the anti Communist movie to end all anti Communist movies
Some have surmised that McCarey had lost his hallmark deep sympathy for his characters by the s Stuart Klawans wrote in The New York Times in that gentleness itself had become a sin In his view McCarey's exquisitely sensitive handling of the mother son relationship in the first part of the film was undercut by Myles Connolly a screenwriter known for writing many a bullying speech for Frank Capra Klawans hears Connolly's tone in the film's finale a commencement address warning the young against liberalism
J Hoberman noted the film's dual personality writing that it aspires to the warmth of a domestic comedy while remaining tendentious to the core relentlessly unfunny and starkly melodramatic
