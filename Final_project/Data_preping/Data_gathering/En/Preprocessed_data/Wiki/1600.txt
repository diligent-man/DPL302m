Network commonly known as Ten Network Channel or simply is an Australian commercial television network owned by Ten Network Holdings a division of Paramount Networks UK Australia One of five national free to air networks 's owned and operated stations can be found in the state capital cities of Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide and Perth while affiliates extend the network to regional areas of the country
In Network is usually the fourth rated television network and primary channel in Australia behind the Seven Network the Nine Network and ABC TV Occasionally SBS TV beats in the ratings pushing it into fifth position
From the introduction of TV in until there were three television networks in Australia the National Television Network now the Nine Network the Australian Television Network now the Seven Network and the public ABC National Television Service now ABC TV In the early s the Australian Government began canvassing the idea of licensing a third commercial television station in each capital city This decision was seen by some as a way for the government to defuse growing public dissatisfaction with the dominance of imported overseas programming and the paucity of local content The first of these third licences was granted to United Telecasters a consortium of Amalgamated Wireless Colonial Sugar Refining Company Email Bank of New South Wales and the NRMA on April
Structurally the Australian television industry was closely modelled on the two tiered system that had been in place in Australian radio since the late s One tier consisted of a network of publicly funded television stations run by the ABC which was funded by government budget allocation and until by fees from television viewer licences The second tier consisted of the commercial networks and independent stations owned by private operators whose income came from selling advertising time
The network was launched as ATV in Melbourne opened on August and was owned by the Ansett Transport Industries which at the time owned one of Australia's two domestic airlines TEN in Sydney which opened on April was originally owned by United Telecasters which also in July that year opened TVQ in Brisbane Also opened later that month was SAS serving the city of Adelaide
The new television network was initially dubbed the Independent Television System or ITS but in adopted the title The Network which reflected the channels used by the first two stations launched in the group ATV and TEN
Melbourne's ATV was the first station of the network to stage colour broadcasts in the broadcast was that of the horse races in Pakenham Victoria which was seen by network and RCA executives and invited members of the media and press This would the first of many test colour telecasts for the station and in tribute to this event the Network adopted the First in Colour slogan in within months before March transition to colour broadcasting
For its first five years the Network led a hand to mouth existence By the beginning of the s the network was in a precarious financial position and there were predictions that it would fail
In the Network first aired Young Talent Time which was a huge ratings success and ran for years
However the network's true financial reprise came about due to the fact that the controversial adult soap opera serial Number which premiered in March on the night that Australian TV lost its virginity The series broke new ground for Australian television and captured the imagination of viewers like few programs before or since For the next three years it was consistently Australia's top rating television program and not surprisingly its huge popularity attracted advertisers to Ten en masse with the result that its revenue increased significantly from million in to more than million in
However the pattern of ratings dominance was already set and for most of the next five decades from the mid s there was little deviation from the prevalent rankings with the Nine Network typically in first place the Seven Network second third and ABC TV fourth
The gradual evolution of Network Ten into its current form has its origins in the ongoing attempts by media mogul Rupert Murdoch to acquire a prized commercial television licence in Australia's largest capital city market Sydney This began when Murdoch's News Limited purchased the Wollongong station WIN Television in the early s around the same time he bought Festival Records In frustrated by regulatory blocks that prevented him from expanding into the Sydney market Murdoch sold WIN and purchased a share in Ten Sydney
In Murdoch made an unsuccessful takeover bid for the Melbourne based The Herald and Weekly Times media group which originally owned HSV Although the bid failed he gained a stake in Ansett which thus gave him control of channel in Melbourne
In first aired the soap opera Prisoner which was a huge ratings success
On January the Network became known as Network Ten to reflect ATV moving from channel to channel although the Brisbane station continued to broadcast as TVQ until September when the station changed to TVQ In Adelaide's Network Ten affiliate SAS and Seven Network affiliate ADS successfully negotiated to exchange affiliation rights and channel frequencies due to ownership problems On December the exchange came into effect and ADS owned by the same owners as the main Network Ten stations became ADS with SAS converting to SAS operated by TVW in Perth
When Murdoch became an American citizen in so that he could expand his media empire in the United States with the Fox network Australia's media ownership laws obliged him to dispose of the flagship television stations which were sold to The Northern Star an offshoot of the Westfield Group conglomerate controlled by property tycoon Frank Lowy However Westfield was badly hit by the stock market crash of and in sold Network Ten to a consortium led by Charles Curran and former television journalist Steve Cosser
The network became fully national in with the launch of NEW in Perth after the introduction of satellite facilities made it economical for the network to broadcast to Western Australia Northern Star officially took hold of TVQ later in the year because of swapping frequencies with neighbouring DDQ in Toowoomba and rebranded CTC Canberra under the network banner in time for aggregation
In Ten's ratings were in decline so on July recently recruited network boss Bob Shanks relaunched the network re branding it as TV Australia and introduced several new programs including four new prime time game shows However by the end of the ratings had failed to improve and most of the new programs were cancelled except for its Eyewitness News newscasts Neighbours and E Street debuting in late
Meanwhile owners Northern Star Holdings were having financial and regulatory problems The company was subject to an inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in relation to media ownership rules and had run into financial difficulties following the stock market crash two years earlier On September Northern Star Holdings announced a major restructure to pay off debts and help restore profitability The proposals included selling off the network's three smaller stations ADS Adelaide NEW Perth and CTC Canberra to Charles Curran's Capital Television Group The sale was complete on October effectively splitting Northern Star's Network Ten in half
