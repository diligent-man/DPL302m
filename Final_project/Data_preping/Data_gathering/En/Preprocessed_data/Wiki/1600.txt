Network 10 (commonly known as Ten Network, Channel 10 or simply 10) is an Australian commercial television network owned by Ten Network Holdings, a division of Paramount Networks UK & Australia
One of five national free-to-air networks, 10's owned-and-operated stations can be found in the state capital cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth while affiliates extend the network to regional areas of the country.
In 2022, Network 10 is usually the fourth rated television network and primary channel in Australia, behind the Seven Network, the Nine Network and ABC TV
Occasionally SBS TV beats 10 in the ratings, pushing it into fifth position.
From the introduction of TV in 1956 until 1965 there were three television networks in Australia, the National Television Network (now the Nine Network), the Australian Television Network (now the Seven Network), and the public ABC National Television Service (now ABC TV)
In the early 1960s, the Australian Government began canvassing the idea of licensing a third commercial television station in each capital city
This decision was seen by some as a way for the government to defuse growing public dissatisfaction with the dominance of imported overseas programming and the paucity of local content
The first of these third licences was granted to United Telecasters (a consortium of Amalgamated Wireless, Colonial Sugar Refining Company, Email, Bank of New South Wales and the NRMA) on 4 April 1963.
Structurally, the Australian television industry was closely modelled on the two-tiered system that had been in place in Australian radio since the late 1930s
One tier consisted of a network of publicly funded television stations run by the ABC, which was funded by government budget allocation and (until 1972) by fees from television viewer licences
The second tier consisted of the commercial networks and independent stations owned by private operators, whose income came from selling advertising time.
The network was launched as ATV-0 in Melbourne opened on 1 August 1964 and was owned by the Ansett Transport Industries, which at the time owned one of Australia's two domestic airlines
TEN-10 in Sydney, which opened on 5 April 1965, was originally owned by United Telecasters, which also in July that year opened TVQ-0 in Brisbane
Also opened later that month was SAS-10, serving the city of Adelaide.
The new television network was initially dubbed the Independent Television System or ITS, but in 1970 adopted the title The 0-10 Network, which reflected the channels used by the first two stations launched in the group, ATV and TEN.
Melbourne's ATV was the first station of the network to stage colour broadcasts in 1967, the broadcast was that of the horse races in Pakenham, Victoria, which was seen by network and RCA executives and invited members of the media and press
This would the first of many test colour telecasts for the station, and in tribute to this event, the 0-10 Network adopted the First in Colour slogan in 1974, within months before 1 March 1975 transition to colour broadcasting.
For its first five years, the 0-10 Network led a hand-to-mouth existence
By the beginning of the 1970s the network was in a precarious financial position and there were predictions that it would fail.
In 1971, the 0-10 Network first aired Young Talent Time, which was a huge ratings success, and ran for 17 years.
However, the network's true financial reprise came about due to the fact that the controversial adult soap opera serial Number 96, which premiered in March 1972 on the night that "Australian TV lost its virginity"
The series broke new ground for Australian television and captured the imagination of viewers like few programs before or since
For the next three years it was consistently Australia's top-rating television program and, not surprisingly, its huge popularity attracted advertisers to Ten en masse, with the result that its revenue increased significantly from $1 million in 1971 to more than $10 million in 1972.
However, the pattern of ratings dominance was already set, and for most of the next five decades from the mid-1960s there was little deviation from the prevalent rankings, with the Nine Network typically in first place, the Seven Network second, 0-10 third and ABC TV fourth.
The gradual evolution of Network Ten into its current form has its origins in the ongoing attempts by media mogul Rupert Murdoch to acquire a prized commercial television licence in Australia's largest capital city market, Sydney
This began when Murdoch's News Limited purchased the Wollongong station WIN Television in the early 1960s, around the same time he bought Festival Records
In 1977, frustrated by regulatory blocks that prevented him from expanding into the Sydney market, Murdoch sold WIN and purchased a 46% share in Ten Sydney.
In 1979, Murdoch made an unsuccessful takeover bid for the Melbourne-based The Herald and Weekly Times media group, which originally owned HSV-7
Although the bid failed, he gained a 50% stake in Ansett, which thus gave him control of channel 0 in Melbourne.
In 1979, 0-10 first aired the soap opera Prisoner, which was a huge ratings success.
On 20 January 1980, the 0-10 Network became known as Network Ten to reflect ATV moving from channel 0 to channel 10 – although the Brisbane station continued to broadcast as TVQ-0 until 10 September 1988 when the station changed to TVQ-10
In 1987 Adelaide's Network Ten affiliate (SAS-10) and Seven Network affiliate (ADS-7) successfully negotiated to exchange affiliation rights and channel frequencies due to ownership problems
On 27 December 1987, the exchange came into effect and ADS-7, owned by the same owners as the main Network Ten stations, became ADS-10 with SAS-10 converting to SAS-7, operated by TVW-7 in Perth.
When Murdoch became an American citizen in 1985 so that he could expand his media empire in the United States with the Fox network, Australia's media ownership laws obliged him to dispose of the flagship television stations, which were sold to The Northern Star, an offshoot of the Westfield Group conglomerate controlled by property tycoon Frank Lowy
However, Westfield was badly hit by the stock market crash of 1987, and in 1989 sold Network Ten to a consortium led by Charles Curran and former television journalist Steve Cosser.
The network became fully national in 1988 with the launch of NEW-10 in Perth, after the introduction of satellite facilities made it economical for the network to broadcast to Western Australia
Northern Star officially took hold of TVQ-10 later in the year because of swapping frequencies with neighbouring DDQ-0 in Toowoomba and rebranded CTC Canberra under the network banner in time for aggregation.
In 1989, Ten's ratings were in decline, so on 23 July 1989, recently recruited network boss Bob Shanks relaunched the network, re-branding it as 10 TV Australia, and introduced several new programs, including four new prime time game shows
However, by the end of 1989 the ratings had failed to improve and most of the new programs were cancelled, except for its Eyewitness News newscasts, Neighbours and E Street (debuting in late 1988).
Meanwhile, owners Northern Star Holdings were having financial and regulatory problems
The company was subject to an inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in relation to media ownership rules and had run into financial difficulties following the 1987 stock market crash two years earlier
On 1 September 1989, Northern Star Holdings announced a major restructure to pay off debts and help restore profitability
The proposals included selling off the network's three smaller stations; ADS Adelaide, NEW Perth and CTC Canberra to Charles Curran's Capital Television Group
The sale was complete on 27 October 1989, effectively splitting Northern Star's Network Ten in half.
In September 1990, Northern Star filed for receivership and in January 1991, the network was re-branded back to Network Ten with the first version of its famous ten watermark logo
The network entered liquidation in May 1991
In 1992, the network's flagship stations were sold to the Canadian-based Canwest media group, which held a controlling stake in the network until 2009
Also in 1992, the network commenced a strategy of targeting younger audiences
The Adelaide and Perth stations were re-acquired by the network in 1995.
With the network having financially recovered, Ten Network Holdings floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1998
At this time, Ten had affiliate broadcasting agreements with Southern Cross Broadcasting in southern New South Wales, regional Victoria and Tasmania, and with Telecasters Australia in northern New South Wales and regional Queensland.
In 2001, Ten opened the doors to the Big Brother Australia house and with it reality television
The opening night of Big Brother became the most watched programs of the night
The trend was then followed by launching the Australian version of reality singing competition format Idols called Australian Idol in 2003
Australian Idol was a hit for several years, lasting until 2009.
In 2004, Network Ten enjoyed its best year since the 1970s, winning two ratings weeks (out of 40) and finishing second nationally only behind the Nine Network and well ahead of the Seven Network
This was a departure from previous years, in which it typically places third behind Nine and Seven in most other ratings years since 2000.
In 2005, Canwest was in discussions with newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings about a possible sale of the network, after the federal government indicated it may consider relaxing Australia's media cross-ownership laws
Previously, newspaper owners could not own television stations in the same city
Fairfax owned the Seven Network until 1988, and had been looking for a way back into television for a long time.
On 21 August 2005, the network celebrated its 40th birthday with a two-hour highlights package called Ten: Seriously 40, which was hosted by Bert Newton and Rove McManus.
On 27 October 2005, Network Ten announced that its long-running morning talk-variety program Good Morning Australia would be cancelled at the end of the year after a fourteen-year run
This ended host Bert Newtons 14-year association with Network Ten, although he was offered ongoing employment with the network, he announced that he would be returning to the Nine Network
9am with David & Kim replaced GMA as Ten's national morning program from 2006 to 2009.
From 2006 to 2008, Ten was the official broadcaster of Sydney New Year's Eve
The rights returned to the Nine Network from 2009.
On 7 August 2007, Network Ten and Foxtel signed a new agreement allowing Ten's digital signal to be transmitted via Foxtel's cable and satellite services
Prior to this, Ten was only transmitted via cable on Foxtel in an analogue format and Austar in standard definition digital via Mystar
Similarly in October 2007, Network Ten and Optus announced that Ten's digital signal would be available on its cable network from 1 December 2007.
On 16 December 2007, Ten HD was officially launched as a breakaway channel, becoming the first new commercial television channel in metropolitan areas of Australia since 1988
Ten HD ceased broadcasting on 25 March 2009 when it was replaced by what was a sports-only high-definition channel, One HD.
On 24 September 2009, Canwest announced that it was selling its 50.1% stake in Ten Network Holdings for $680 million, to pay down its significant debt
In late 2009, Canwest filed for creditor bankruptcy protection, due to CA$4 billion mounting debt across radio, television broadcasting and publishing assets in several countries.
On 20 October 2010, four years after he sold his shares in PBL Media to private equity firm CVC Asia Pacific, James Packer purchased 16 per cent of Ten.
Network Ten launched a new digital channel, Eleven, on 11 January 2011
The channel is aimed at a "distinctly youthful" audience between the ages of 13 and 29
Neighbours and The Simpsons were high-profile programs migrating from Ten to the new channel
The channel was a joint venture with CBS Studios International, which owned a 33% stake.
On 8 May 2011, Ten relaunched its sports based channel One, with general entertainment programming aimed at males taking over the schedule
It is aimed at a similar audience to 7mate.
In 2012, Ten unsuccessfully launched many new programs
This led to Ten's ratings dropping to fourth place behind ABC TV for over thirty straight nights
The poor performance resulted in Chief Programming Officer David Mott's resignation.
In late 2012, Ten reported a loss of $12.9m as it battled poor advertising markets and failed to hold larger audience numbers
They made positions at the station redundant and said that production may become centralised.
Analogue broadcasts ceased in the regions on 10 December 2013.
On 15 June 2015, Foxtel (co-owned by News Corp) bought 15% shares in Ten Network Holdings, pending the approval from the ACCC
Prior to the acquisition, Discovery backed out from bidding partnership with Foxtel
In July 2015, Paul Anderson was announced as the new chief executive officer.
A high-definition simulcast of 10 was revived on 2 March 2016
As a result, One, now known as 10 Bold, began broadcasting in standard definition only.
On 29 April 2016, the Nine Network pulled its regional affiliation with WIN Television over a lawsuit involving its catch-up service 9Now, and announced a new affiliation agreement with Southern Cross Austereo, Ten's then-primary regional affiliate
Ten subsequently negotiated a five-year affiliation deal with WIN; the new affiliations took effect on 1 July, with WIN becoming the carrier of Network Ten programming in regional Queensland, Northern NSW, Southern NSW, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Gold Coast
WIN owner and Ten's largest shareholder Bruce Gordon positioned himself to increase his ownership stake in Ten, subject to changes to media ownership laws being passed.
Following Ten Network Holdings reporting a $232 million half year loss, billionaire shareholders Lachlan Murdoch, Bruce Gordon and James Packer withdrew support for $250 million guaranteed loan that would help keep Ten out of receivership
This loan was intended to replace an existing guaranteed $200 million loan that was due to expire in December
On 13 June, Ten asked the Australian Securities Exchange that their stock be placed in a 48-hour trading halt while it assessed its options concerning receivership
It went into voluntary administration the following day.
On 28 August 2017, Ten's administrators announced that the U.S
media company CBS Corporation (which had a 33% share in the multichannel Eleven and was Ten's largest creditor) had entered into a binding agreement to purchase the company for $123 million
CBS refinanced Ten's existing debt including guarantor fees to billionaire shareholders James Packer, Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon, and existing loans from the Commonwealth Bank
Shareholders in Ten Network Holdings lost their investment.
Gordon and Murdoch had also placed their own joint bid for the company, which was not endorsed by the administrators
At a meeting held on 12 September, Ten's creditors overwhelmingly voted in support of CBS' bid, citing concerns over Murdoch's previous management of Ten and talk of mass job cuts in the news department under Murdoch/Gordon ownership.
The CBS acquisition was completed on 16 November 2017, when the shares of Ten Network Holdings were transferred to CBS Network Ten BV, a company registered in the Netherlands.
Following the CBS acquisition, the network became a division of CBS Studios International
Ten moved to commission more Australian content
The additional programs were financed by the savings from the dissolution of Ten's output agreement with 21st Century Fox
CBS also moved to re-establish an in-house advertising sales department for 2019, bringing to an end Ten's four-year period with the Foxtel-affiliated Multi Channel Network (MCN)
One reason CBS acquired Ten was to assist the company to launch its CBS All Access streaming service in the Australian market
The service launched in December 2018 and was branded 10 All Access in the local market.
On 31 October 2018, the network unveiled a new logo, replacing the "ten" wordmark used since 1991 with a stylised circle 10, and the network now referred to in text as Network 10
The new brand is used across all of Network 10's platforms and services, and was intended to reflect the broadcaster's positioning as an "adventurous alternative" with a "sense of fun"
10 also relaunched its multichannels Eleven and One as 10 Peach and 10 Boss, with Boss focusing on dramatic programming and targeting an older adult audience, and Peach continuing to be targeted towards young adults
10 Boss was forced to change its name to 10 Bold on 10 December 2018 due to trademark conflicts with Fairfax Media.
On 4 December 2019, CBS Corporation completed a re-merger with fellow media conglomerate Viacom as ViacomCBS; the two companies had previously separated in 2005
ViacomCBS subsequently began to integrate the companies' operations in Australia; in a reorganization of the ViacomCBS Networks International division, Network 10 would join its new sister network in the United Kingdom, Channel 5 (previously owned by Viacom) as part of ViacomCBS Networks UK & Australia in January 2020
The following month, it was announced that the former Viacom channels in Australia would be brought under the Network 10 sales department, moving away from Foxtel Media (formerly MCN) in April
Network 10 also began to co-commission new programmes with Channel 5, including the drama miniseries Lie With Me and documentary series The Royals Revealed
In February 2022, it similarly announced that it had ordered a spin-off of CBS's drama franchise NCIS that would be set in Sydney.
On 13 July 2020, it was announced that Network 10 would launch a third digital channel, 10 Shake, on 27 September
The network will carry children's programmes in the daytime hours (drawing primarily television from Nickelodeon), while evening and prime time hours will feature "edgy" series and films targeting young adults, including television programmes from Comedy Central and MTV, and CBS late-night talk show The Late Late Show with James Corden.
In March 2021, 10 announced that it would return to Southern Cross Austereo as its regional affiliate in most markets beginning on 1 July 2021, in a deal that will last at least two years
The agreement reversed 10's 2016 move to WIN, which had announced a long-term agreement to return to the Nine Network.
Ten's current Australian program line-up consists of series such as: Neighbours, Bondi Rescue, Australian Survivor, I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, The Masked Singer Australia, Gogglebox Australia (with Foxtel's LifeStyle), Celebrity Name Game, Studio 10, RPM, Sports Tonight, The Amazing Race Australia, The Project, The Living Room, Ambulance Australia, Todd Sampson's Body Hack, Hunted Australia, MasterChef Australia, The Bachelor Australia, The Bachelorette Australia, Bachelor in Paradise Australia, Have You Been Paying Attention?, The Cheap Seats, The Cube, Dive Club, The Dog House Australia, First Dates Australia, Would I Lie to You?

Current US programming that airs on 10 and its digital multichannels is sourced from 10's deals Paramount International Networks (owner) / MTV Networks and Nickelodeon International (selected televisions only; long running) / Paramount Home Entertainment (Paramount films) (selected films only; now elapsed), DreamWorks Television / DreamWorks Animation (selected films only; now elapsed), StudioCanal / Sony Pictures Television International, Village Roadshow Entertainment / Warner Bros
Television Distribution and Warner Bros
Family Entertainment (theatrical films only), Disney Platform Distribution (Touchstone films only), and Transmission Films
When it was independent, Ten had a long-standing relationship with CBS Studios International for Australian rights to its content.
On 30 October 2017, the network ceased its output deal as a side effect of the network's bankruptcy and CBS acquisition
The network would go on to lose their deal with 20th Century Fox, and with it, the network's rights to The Simpsons, Modern Family and Life in Pieces, among many others
In 2018 however, 10 would create a new acquired programming deal with Warner Bros
and Roadshow, granting the network programming rights which they currently share with Nine
On 3 February 2019, they would also revive their rights for programming from Sony Pictures Television International, which they now share with Nine and Seven.
Due to the ViacomCBS merge in 2019, 10 would no longer need to revive their movie rights for Paramount (ViacomCBS Films) & DreamWorks, as they were now a unit of ViacomCBS Australia & New Zealand
Therefore, 10 had access to programming from Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon, along with Channel 5 in the United Kingdom and Telefe in Argentina
The rights to Paramount television programming is shared between the Nine Network, Network 10, ABC, and SBS
Nickelodeon television programming is also shared between 9Go!, 10 Shake, ABC Kids, and ABC ME; though most of its programming has usually aired on Network 10 and 10 Shake since 2020.
Sharing programs is currently a new rule for all the networks after a very, very long absence which have their own programs from 1990s to 2014
All the networks can now share the programs again with each networks of televisions and films, including splitting up the different seasons of the same television series or franchise
Also some television brands can split the different seasons of the same television series by aired on both networks.

NBCUniversal, Paramount (ViacomCBS Films), DreamWorks, and Miramax now belong to Nine Network, Nine revived NBCUniversal, Paramount (ViacomCBS Films), DreamWorks, and Miramax broadcast rights.
From 2018 onwards, rival film and television rights with 20th Century Fox from 2008 to 2017 and Regency Enterprises from 2015 to 2017
Fox and Regency now belong to Seven Network and Nine Network, Seven and Nine revived 20th Century Fox and Regency broadcast rights.
Network 10's news service is called 10 News First (previously Ten News & Ten Eyewitness News)
It produces local bulletins each weeknight and national bulletins on weekends.
The news service also produces nightly panel show The Project.
Ten has access to sister service CBS News for international news coverage.
During weekday overnights and Sunday mornings, Network 10 rebroadcasts American television network CBS's (sister network since 2017) morning news program CBS Mornings.
In November 2006, Network 10 struck a deal with CBS, reportedly worth A$6 million a year
This allows Network Ten the rights to air all CBS News footage, as well as access to its 60 Minutes, Dr
Phil, Late Show with David Letterman and 48 Hours programs
This deal occurred after CBS's talks with the Nine Network broke down, with Nine refusing to pay A$8 million a year to continue its 40-year deal with CBS
Ten in turn struck a cheaper deal, and has onsold CBS's 60 Minutes stories to Nine.
On 31 July 2012, Entertainment Tonight was picked up by Network 10 after airing since 1982 until 30 June 2012 on the Nine Network following cutbacks on overseas purchases.
In late 2012, 10 reported a loss of $12.9m as it battled poor advertising markets and failed to hold larger audience numbers
They made positions at the station redundant and said that production may become centralised.
The network is a major player in Australian sports broadcasting
All sports broadcasts on 10 and its multichannels are labelled under the 10 Sport brand
Since the ViacomCBS takeover however, the channel has significantly toned down its commitment to sports programming.
The network holds the free-to-air broadcast rights to the Wallabies (since 2013) games, the Melbourne Cup Carnival (since 2019), Formula One (since 2003) and MotoGP (since 1997).
In 2002, 10 combined with the Nine Network and Foxtel to acquire broadcast rights for the Australian Football League, the elite Australian rules football competition, displacing the Seven Network which had held the rights for more than 40 years
10 broadcast Saturday afternoon and Saturday night games and had exclusive rights for all finals games
Along with the Seven Network, 10 placed a successful $780 million bid to jointly broadcast the game from 2007 to 2011
Under this deal, 10 continued to broadcast the Saturday component of the competition
However, unlike the previous deal, 10 did not hold the exclusive rights to the finals series
Instead, the networks shared the broadcasting of the finals series and alternated the broadcast of the grand final
In the years when 10 did not televise the Grand Final (2008 and 2010), it telecast the pre-season Grand Final and the Brownlow Medal presentation
10 ended AFL broadcasting after 10 years at the conclusion of the 2011 season.
Ten broadcast the 2007 Rugby World Cup.
In 2003, 10 started broadcasting the Formula One World Championship after the Nine Network dropped the rights in 2002 after more than twenty years of coverage.
All Big Bash League games was broadcast in Australia by 10
In 2013, 10 paid $100 million for BBL rights over five years, marking the channel's first foray in elite domestic cricket coverage
Ten previously held the broadcast rights to the Indian Premier League.
10, in joint partnership with subscription television provider Foxtel, had broadcast rights for the 2010 Commonwealth Games.
10 acquired broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia for AUD$20 million after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Olympic Games due to cost concerns
The Nine Network had lost AUD$22 million on its joint coverage of the 2012 Games with Foxtel, and the Seven Network's bid was rejected for being lower than what Nine/Foxtel had previously paid.
In 2018, 10 signed the rights to the Melbourne Cup Carnival, after the Seven Network ended the rights for 17 years.
In 2019, 10 broadcast the 2019 Rugby World Cup.
In 2021, 10 acquired the rights to a range of football content, most notably both A-League Men and Women competitions as well as Socceroos and Matildas games
The deal also included content from the AFC, which includes the AFC Champions League and other World Cup qualifiers in the AFC region involving non-Australian teams, among others
Football content will be broadcast across both Paramount+ and free-to-air platforms.
Network 10 is available in standard definition and in 1080i high definition
Core programming is fibre fed out of ATV Melbourne to its sister stations and regional affiliates with TEN Sydney providing national news programming
The receiving stations and affiliates then insert their own localised news and advertising which is then broadcast in metropolitan areas via Network 10's owned-and-operated stations TEN Sydney, ATV Melbourne, TVQ Brisbane, ADS Adelaide, and NEW Perth
The network's programming is also carried into regional Australia by various affiliate stations, including Southern Cross Television, WIN Television, Mildura Digital Television, Tasmanian Digital Television, Darwin Digital Television, Central Digital Television and West Digital Television
In addition to this, 10 is retransmitted via Foxtel's cable and satellite pay television services.
The 10 HD multichannel was launched on 16 December 2007 until 25 March 2009 and later revived on 2 March 2016
It broadcasts identical programming to 10, but in 1080i HD.
The network's free video on demand and catch up TV service is called 10 Play
Launched on 29 September 2013, replacing the network's old website that offered limited catch-up TV services
The service is available on the web and via apps for mobile devices, smart TVs, set-top boxes and video game consoles.
Live streaming of Network 10's primary channel commenced on 21 January 2016, although it was available only during selected hours
24 hour live streaming of the main channel commenced on 26 January 2018
A live stream of 10 Bold was available on a part-time basis until 21 February 2019
On 21 February 2019, 10 Bold switched to an 24-hour live stream and 10 Peach added on 10 Play live stream service
On 27 September 2020, 10 Shake is added to 10 Play live stream service.
10 News First during Olympics and Commonwealth Games are not accessible through 10 Play live streaming service due to the digital broadcast rights being owned by IOC rights.
For the 2006 series of Big Brother, Ten appointed two censors to review the show instead of one
The Federal Minister for Communications, Senator Helen Coonan, was reported to have said that she would be keeping a "close watch on the show's 2006 series"
This controversy resulted in Big Brother Uncut being renamed Big Brother: Adults Only for the 2006 season of Big Brother
In two separate findings, the Australian Communications and Media Authority determined Network Ten breached clause 2.4 of the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice
These two breaches were in relation to the broadcast of Big Brother Uncut on 30 May, 13 June and 4 July 2005
The broadcast material was not classified according to the Television Classification Guidelines.
Despite toning down Big Brother: Adults Only significantly in comparison to 2005, the series continued to attract controversy
 After Big Brother: Adults Only was abruptly cancelled several weeks early, a subsequent incident of alleged sexual assault in the house saw the removal of two housemates and a huge public outcry calling for the series to be cancelled entirely
This incident generated significant publicity for the show, even prompting the Prime Minister of Australia to call on Network Ten to "do a bit of self-regulation and get this stupid program off the air."
Just prior to the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Network Ten broadcast 911: In Plane Site, a documentary that examined conspiracy theories about the terrorist attacks
 Federal Labor politician Michael Danby demanded that the programming director of the station be sacked.
On 8 October 2008, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) found Network Ten guilty of breaching the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice by using subliminal advertising during the broadcast of the 2007 ARIA Music Awards on 28 October 2007
Network Ten had inserted single frames (lasting 1/25th of a second) into the program broadcast
This was exposed on ABC's Media Watch program.
From 1964 to 1984 Network Ten's four stations – ATV-0/ATV-10 Melbourne, TEN-10 Sydney, TVQ-0 Brisbane and SAS-10 Adelaide – used different logos to identify themselves
There had also been a number of network-wide logos used from the mid-1960s through to the early 1980s.
By late-1985 ATV-10, SAS-10 and TEN-10 were all using the same logo – a circle with "TEN" in the centre, somewhat in the style of a neon sign
This logo had been introduced by TEN-10 on 16 January 1983, was adopted by ATV-10 in June 1984 and by SAS-10 in November 1985
The logo was also similar to the new logo adopted by Brisbane's TVQ-0 in April 1983, when that station became branded as TV0 – a neon sign-style circle with "TV" in the centre.
Kicking off several years of branding upheaval, on 24 January 1988 ATV-10, ADS-10 and TEN-10 all adopted the "X TEN" logo, followed by Perth's NEW-10 when the station launched in May of that year, and finally TVQ-0 on 10 September, when the station changed frequency and became TVQ-10
On 23 July 1989, the network rebranded again to "10 TV Australia".
On 13 January 1991, the network introduced a new logo featuring a lowercase "ten" in a circle; four variations of this logo would appear over the next 27 years
The first version consisted of a white, silver or metallic ring enclosing a blue circle with "ten" in yellow lower case text
A revision of the logo with a yellow ring was introduced with the "Give Me Ten" ident campaign in 1995, but the white/silver/metallic ring was reintroduced with the network's 1997 idents
It was not until 1 October 1999 when the "Electric" ident was launched that the ring became yellow permanently.
In January 2008, the logo was enhanced for HD with a glossy "ball" effect similar to the logo of American network ABC
On 22 June 2013, the logo changed again, when the ring and lettering became blue as well.
On 31 October 2018, Ten unveiled a completely new logo, in its first major rebranding since 1991
The new branding replaced the "ten" wordmark with a numeric 10 in a circle
The "10" used in the logo is similar to those of American local TV stations WBNS-TV and WTSP
Coincidentally, the stations are affiliates of the CBS television network in the U.S., albeit as affiliates owned by Tegna Inc
as opposed to owned-and-operated stations part of CBS Television Stations.
