The Oberkommando des Heeres lit 'Upper Command of the Army' abbreviated OKH was the high command of the Army of Nazi Germany It was founded in as part of Adolf Hitler's rearmament of Germany OKH was de facto the most important unit within the German war planning until the defeat at Moscow in December
During World War II OKH had the responsibility of strategic planning of Armies and Army Groups The General Staff of the OKH managed operational matters Each German Army also had an Army High Command Armeeoberkommando or AOK The Armed Forces High Command Oberkommando der Wehrmacht then took over this function for theatres other than the Eastern front
The OKH commander held the title of Commander in chief of the Army Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres After the Battle of Moscow the OKH commander Field marshal Walther von Brauchitsch was removed from office and Hitler appointed himself as Commander in Chief of the Army
From OKH was together with Oberkommando der Luftwaffe transl Air Force High Command and Oberkommando der Marine transl Naval High Command formally subordinated to the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht OKW transl High Command of the Armed Forces
OKH had been independent until February when Hitler created the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht which on paper subordinated OKH to OKW After a major crisis developed in the Battle of Moscow von Brauchitsch was dismissed partly because of his failing health and Hitler appointed himself as head of the OKH At the same time he limited the OKH's authority to the Russian front giving OKW direct authority over army units elsewhere This enabled Hitler to declare that only he had complete awareness of Germany's strategic situation should any general request a transfer of resources between the Russian front and another theatre of operations
Although both OKW and OKH were headquartered in the Maybach complex in Nazi Germany the functional and operational independence of both establishments were not lost on the respective staff during their tenure Personnel at the compound remarked that even if Maybach the OKW complex was completely destroyed the OKH staff in Maybach would scarcely notice These camouflaged facilities separated physically by a fence also maintained structurally different mindsets towards their objectives
On April two days before his suicide Hitler formally subordinated OKH to OKW giving the latter command of forces on the Eastern Front
In these elements were subordinate to the OKH
