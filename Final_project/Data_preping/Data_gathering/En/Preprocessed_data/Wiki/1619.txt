multilevel converter advantage allow harmonic filtering equipment reduced eliminated altogether
way comparison ac harmonic filter typical line-commutated converter station cover nearly half converter station area
time voltage-source converter system probably replace installed simple thyristor-based system including highest dc power transmission applications
long-distance point-to-point hvdc transmission scheme generally ha lower overall investment cost lower loss equivalent ac transmission scheme
hvdc conversion equipment terminal station costly total dc transmission-line cost long distance lower ac line distance
hvdc requires le conductor per unit distance ac line need support three phase skin effect

hvdc overhead line onshore wind integration project hvdc cable offshore project proposed north america europe technical economic reasons
dc grid multiple voltage-source converter vscs one technical solution pooling offshore wind energy transmitting load center located far away onshorelong undersea underground high-voltage cable high electrical capacitance compared overhead transmission line since live conductor within cable surrounded relatively thin layer
alternating current used cable transmission additional current must flow cable charge cable capacitance
extra current flow cause added energy loss via dissipation heat conductor cable raising temperature
additional energy loss also occur result dielectric loss cable insulation
however direct current used cable capacitance charged cable first energized voltage level change additional current required
sufficiently long ac cable entire current-carrying ability conductor would needed supply charging current alone
cable capacitance issue limit length power-carrying ability ac power cables
dc powered cable limited temperature rise ohm's law
although leakage current flow dielectric insulator small compared cable's rated current
capacitive effect long underground undersea cable ac transmission application also applies ac overhead line although much lesser extent
nevertheless long ac overhead transmission line current flowing charge line capacitance significant reduces capability line carry useful current load remote end
another factor reduces useful current-carrying ability ac line skin effect cause nonuniform distribution current cross-sectional area conductor
transmission line conductor operating direct current suffer neither constraint
therefore conductor loss heating effect given conductor carry power load operating hvdc ac
finally depending upon environmental condition performance overhead line insulation operating hvdc may possible given transmission line operate constant hvdc voltage approximately peak ac voltage designed insulated

therefore hvdc line operate continuously hvdc voltage peak voltage ac equivalent line given current hvdc current rms current ac line power transmission capability operating hvdc approximately higher capability operating ac
hvdc allows power transmission unsynchronized ac distribution system help increase system stability preventing cascading failure propagating one part wider power transmission grid another
change load would cause portion ac network become unsynchronized separate would similarly affect dc link power flow dc link would tend stabilize ac network
magnitude direction power flow dc link directly controlled changed needed support ac network either end dc link
ha caused many power system operator contemplate wider use hvdc technology stability benefit alone
hvdc le reliable ha lower availability alternating current ac system mainly due extra conversion equipment
single-pole system availability third downtime unscheduled due faults
fault-tolerant bipole system provide high availability link capacity availability full capacity to
smaller transmission distance loss converter station may bigger ac transmission line distance
cost converter may offset reduction line construction cost lower line loss
operating hvdc scheme requires many spare part kept often exclusively one system hvdc system le standardized ac system technology change quickly
contrast ac system realizing multi-terminal system complex especially line commutated converter expanding existing scheme multi-terminal systems
controlling power flow multi-terminal dc system requires good communication terminal power flow must actively regulated converter control system instead relying inherent impedance phase angle property ac transmission line

early hvdc system used electromechanical conversion thury system hvdc system built since used electronic static converters
voltage-sourced converter current-source convertersmost hvdc system operation today based line-commutated converters
basic lcc configuration us three-phase bridge rectifier six-pulse bridge containing six electronic switch connecting one three phase one two dc rails
complete switching element usually referred valve irrespective construction
however phase change every considerable harmonic distortion produced dc ac terminal arrangement used
ac split two separate three phase supply transformation
one set supply configured star wye secondary delta secondary establishing phase difference two set three phases
twelve valve connecting two set three phase two dc rail phase change every harmonic considerably reduced
reason twelve-pulse system ha become standard line-commutated converter hvdc system built since s
line commutated converter converter ha one degree freedom firing angle represents time delay voltage across valve becoming positive point valve would start conduct made diode thyristors turned on
dc output voltage converter steadily becomes le positive firing angle increased firing angle correspond rectification result positive dc voltage firing angle correspond inversion result negative dc voltages
practical upper limit firing angle valve would insufficient turnoff time
early lcc system used mercury-arc valve rugged required high maintenance
many mercury-arc hvdc system built bypass switchgear across six-pulse bridge hvdc scheme could operated six-pulse mode short period maintenance
thyristor valve wa first used hvdc system in
thyristor solid-state semiconductor device similar diode extra control terminal used switch device particular instant ac cycle
voltage hvdc system kv case far exceed breakdown voltage thyristors used hvdc thyristor valve built using large number thyristors series
additional passive component grading capacitor resistor need connected parallel thyristor order ensure voltage across valve evenly shared thyristors
thyristor plus grading circuit auxiliary equipment known thyristor level
thyristor valve typically contain ten hundred thyristor level operating different high potential respect earth
command information turn thyristors therefore cannot simply sent using wire connection need isolated
two optical method used indirect direct optical triggering
indirect optical triggering method low-voltage control electronics send light pulse along optical fibre high-side control electronics derives power voltage across thyristor
alternative direct optical triggering method dispenses high-side electronics instead using light pulse control electronics switch light-triggered thyristors ltts although small monitoring electronics unit may still required protection valve
line-commutated converter dc current usually cannot change direction flow large inductance considered almost constant
ac side converter behaves approximately current source injecting grid-frequency harmonic current ac network
reason line commutated converter hvdc also considered current-source inverter
thyristors turned control action control system ha one degree freedom turn thyristor
type semiconductor device insulated-gate bipolar transistor igbt turn-on turn-off controlled giving second degree freedom
converter polarity dc voltage usually fixed dc voltage smoothed large capacitance considered constant
reason hvdc converter using igbts usually referred voltage sourced converter
additional controllability give many advantage notably ability switch igbts many time per cycle order improve harmonic performance
self-commutated converter longer relies synchronous machine ac system operation
voltage sourced converter therefore feed power ac network consisting passive load something impossible lcc hvdc
hvdc system based voltage sourced converter normally use six-pulse connection converter produce much le harmonic distortion comparable lcc twelve-pulse connection unnecessary
vsc hvdc system built based two level converter thought six pulse bridge thyristors replaced igbts inverse-parallel diode dc smoothing reactor replaced dc smoothing capacitors

pulse-width modulation pwm usually used improve harmonic distortion converter
hvdc system built three level converter today new vsc hvdc system built form multilevel converter commonly modular multilevel converter mmc valve consists number independent converter submodules containing storage capacitor
igbts submodule either bypass capacitor connect circuit allowing valve synthesize stepped voltage low level harmonic distortion
ac side converter bank transformer often three physically separated single-phase transformer isolate station ac supply provide local earth ensure correct eventual dc voltage
converter transformer lcc hvdc scheme quite specialized high level harmonic current flow secondary winding insulation experience permanent dc voltage affect design insulating structure valve side requires solid insulation inside tank
lcc system transformer also need provide phase shift needed harmonic cancellation
converter transformer vsc hvdc system usually simpler conventional design lcc hvdc systems
major drawback hvdc system using line-commutated converter converter inherently consume reactive power
ac current flowing converter ac system lag behind ac voltage irrespective direction active power flow converter always absorbs reactive power behaving way shunt reactor
reactive power absorbed least mvarmw ideal condition higher converter operating higher usual firing extinction angle reduced dc voltage
although hvdc converter station connected directly power station reactive power may provided generator case reactive power consumed converter must provided bank shunt capacitor connected ac terminal converter
shunt capacitor usually connected directly grid voltage case may connected lower voltage via tertiary winding converter transformer
since reactive power consumed depends active power transmitted shunt capacitor usually need subdivided number switchable bank typically four per converter order prevent surplus reactive power generated low transmitted power
shunt capacitor almost always provided tuning reactor necessary damping resistor perform dual role harmonic filters
voltage-source converter hand either produce consume reactive power demand result usually separate shunt capacitor needed required purely filtering
power electronic converter generate degree harmonic distortion ac dc system connected hvdc converter exception
recently developed modular multilevel converter mmc level harmonic distortion may practically negligible line-commutated converter simpler type voltage-source converter considerable harmonic distortion may produced ac dc side converter
result harmonic filter nearly always required ac terminal converter hvdc transmission scheme using overhead line may also required dc side
arrangement produce high level harmonic distortion acting current source injecting harmonic current order n ac system generating harmonic voltage order n superimposed dc voltage
costly provide harmonic filter capable suppressing harmonic variant known twelve-pulse bridge consisting two six-pulse bridge series phase shift nearly always used
twelve-pulse arrangement harmonic still produced order n ac side n dc side
line-commutated converter hvdc usually provided combination harmonic filter designed deal harmonic ac side harmonic dc side
sometimes ac filter may also need provide damping lower-order noncharacteristic harmonic rd harmonics
task designing ac harmonic filter hvdc converter station complex computationally intensive since addition ensuring converter doe produce unacceptable level voltage distortion ac system must ensured harmonic filter resonate component elsewhere ac system

dc filter required hvdc transmission system involving overhead lines
voltage distortion problem right since consumer connect directly dc terminal system main design criterion dc filter ensure harmonic current flowing dc line induce interference nearby open-wire telephone lines
