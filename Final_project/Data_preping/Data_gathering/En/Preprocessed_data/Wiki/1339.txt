Traditional music uses terraced descent type melodic motion with songs consisting of two sections each with a range of more than an octave and scales of four to six tones
The Arapaho Sun Dance performed in the summer when the Arapaho bands come together for the occasion is a ceremony performed in order to guide warriors on a vision receiving a guardian spirit
The vision is inspired by intense self-torture
There are also Arapaho folk songs taught by guardian spirits which are only supposed to be sung when the recipient is near death
Secular Arapaho songs include a wide variety of round dances in triple meter the snake dance the rabbit dance a partner dance introduced after European contact and a turtle dance along with lullabies children's war historical and courtship songs
