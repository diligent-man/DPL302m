vin a serbian cyrillic pronounced nt a is a suburban settlement of belgrade serbia
it is part of the municipality of grocka
vin a belo brdo an important archaeological site that gives its name to the neolithic vin a culture is located in the village
vin a is located on the confluence of the bole ica river into the danube on the danube s right bank km mi east of belgrade and km mi west of its own municipal seat of grocka
it is situated along the stream of maka ki potok which empties into the bole ica
vin a is statistically classified as a rural settlement village
originally it was situated km from the road of smederevski put but as the settlement expanded it now stretches from the danube to the smederevski put making urbanistic connections to the surrounding settlements of ritopek bole le tane and kalu erica though making one continuous built up area with belgrade itself
like the surrounding settlements vin a is an immigrant settlement with steady population growth and the total population number of by the census
small bridge across the bole ica on the smederevski put marks a place where boundaries of four settlements meet vin a ritopek le tane and bole
together they would make a settlement with the population of in and in
vin a s economy is mostly based on agriculture but it also experiences the most diversity of all the municipal settlements
the experimental farm of radmilovac a section of the agricultural faculty of the belgrade university is located to the east
in began the reconstruction and expansion of the farm with new pools and projected covered areas that will turn radmilovac into and experimental ground for future agricultural production
the area along the smederevski put turns into a commercial zone as gas pumps restaurants workshops and supermarkets are built
vin a is on the route of the projected highway in the bole ica river valley separating from the belgrade ni highway at bubanj potok and a new bridge over the danube vin a omoljica bridge but a construction date is not yet given
tourism is mostly centered on the archeological site of belo brdo serbian for white hill and the museum of the vin a culture with boat trips down the danube from downtown belgrade to the small vin a dock right below the find with several fish restaurants on the bank
in order to strengthen the slope below the site an embankment was built in the early s which is today a quay along the danube
hotel radmilovac on the smederevski put is the major such facility from belgrade to smederevo
the vin a nuclear institute was officially established on january by the serbian top physicist pavle savi as the institute for physics though construction of the site began in
on october the institute was the site of a fatal criticality excursion in its heavy water moderated research reactor
one researcher was killed and four others injured
the institute operated two research reactors
the larger mw reactor achieved criticality in and was shut down in
another very low power reactor achieved criticality in and as of was operational
the institute was named the institute for physical sciences boris kidri in and has its present name since january
in the s a modern urban settlement with small residential buildings was constructed for the employees of the institute
in in an effort to secure the radioactive materials from the institute the u s
government aided serbia in the removal of the material
in large convoys moved the remaining tonnes of nuclear fuel to a reprocessing facility in mayak in russia
belgrade s city landfill deponija is located in vin a
official city landfill from used to be ada huja
when the new general urban plan gup was adopted in the early s the projected location of the new landfill was the marsh around veliko selo in the municipality of palilula
the municipality of grocka endorsed the gup but in the idea of placing the landfill in vin a was announced by the city
grocka rejected the proposal and refused to endorse the new decision but the city administration bypassed the local authorities and the new landfill was opened in vin a in
the location was chosen specifically because of the clay bedrock which will prevent the draining of the waste water deeper into the ground
however the drainage system for both the water and the gas was never built and the depositing of the water and gas at the bottom caused numerous problems since then
as of the landfill covers an area of ha acres and receives some t long tons short tons of garbage daily which includes not only the domestic waste but also earth and rubble
out of city municipalities use this landfill
the government decided in to remediate the landfill but they soon stopped searching for the partner in the project
the landfill raised many ecological questions for years as only in the s some of the major problems concerning waste managing began to solve
however despite some recent improvements the landfill is still far from the european standards of environmental management like leachate collection and treatment system
it is as of not only the europe s biggest landfill with between and tons of waste deposited in it but also largest untreated landfill on the continent
since the city s plan on the waste management for the period authorities try to make a deal with investors in the form of the strategic partnership to manage the landfill
with layers of untreated garbage that reach m ft the landfill is considered to be the most problematic ecological spot in europe
in august city officials estimated that the landfill after years of existence contains million tonnes long tons short tons of garbage annually receives additional million tonnes long tons short tons and in total released over billion cubic metres cu ft of methane in the atmosphere
largest deposits are estimated to be metres ft deep
the devastating southeast europe floods triggered a mass wasting in one part of the landfill
as a result of the mass wasting which continued and of the fact that the waste is not being treated just piled on the top a pockets of methane formed deep under the garbage layers
on may several of these pockets on different locations and at the depths of to m to ft bursted into flames
being covered with dirt and earth fire above the ground was extinguished quickly but the smoldering in the deep continued
wide section of belgrade was covered in smoke and bad smell sometimes completely forcing citizens to use masks
smoggy neighborhoods included le e vi njica vi nji ka banja krnja a kote bor a rospi uprija karaburma slanci and veliko selo
by may the smoke reached downtown belgrade
as the methane fire can t be extinguished with water it has to be covered with earthy materials which are to isolate methane from oxygen all trucks bringing earth to the landfill were rerouted to cover the burning section
however as that area is located on the mass wasting ground it went slow preventing the quick damping of the fire
as the winds changed the smoke turned from spreading upstream the danube to belgrade to downstream in the direction of smederevo
in order to extinguish the fire completely for the first time was used a concentrated solution of the brown algae
the preparation acts like the fermentor organically decomposing the matter binding methane ammonia and oxygen thus preventing the spreading of the fire
in june smoky haze and bad smell continued to cover parts of belgrade especially in the mornings and evenings and to spread even further reaching the hilly dedinje and more distant mostar interchange and vidikovac
city institute for public health continuously issued statements that the levels of the basic pollutants in the air are not above the allowed levels but also admitted that the actions to extinguish the fire are not solving the problem and that sensitive groups should reduce time spent outdoors in the case of smoky haze
among the substances checked by the institute are carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide ground level ozone suspended particulate matter below m pm and phenols
however dean of the university of belgrade s faculty of chemistry ivan gr eti stated that the smoke is not that harmless since vin a is not a managed landfill but rather a plain unregulated dump
he said that the fire probably started years ago at the much deeper level to m to ft and that it is highly likely that the fumes contain polychlorinated dibenzofurans and dibenzodioxins but that serbia has no special measuring devices to check their levels
he asserted that those compounds are cancerogenic but a good thing is that the smoke is partially dispersed by wind before it reaches the city
he added that vin a is probably going to burn for years and suggested the piling of the porous pipes which would conduct the methane into the atmosphere
only then after almost a month city administration addressed the issue
mayor sini a mali stated that there is a problem but not that much of a problem as it is presented and that such things happen
in order to prove him that burning garbage is a problem a group of activists brought two metal barrels under the windows of the city hall and burned rubbish in them
commenting on the performance titled greetings from vin a mali said that it is irresponsible that some five people come to me in front of the city hall light fires and scare my people
acting ombudsman of serbia milo jankovi asked from all involved institutions to make public not only the results but also to disclose all information about the way they measure the fumes and a detailed list of all substances covered by those measurements
he was supported by rodoljub abi state commissioner for the information of public importance but the city administration called their initiative utterly pointless unjustified and malicious and that the intended purpose of their action is to scare the citizens and to raise panic
on june the city garbage managing company gradska isto a announced that after filling of the burning section of the landfill with over m cu ft of earth the fire was extinguished
only then the information that at one point the exploding methane burned on an area of ha acres or of the landfill was disclosed
still authorities stated that they can t be sure if the fire was really extinguished in the deep
in october smog began to engulf the city
several specialized foreign pollution and air quality sites reported belgrade as one of the most polluted cities in the world in this period ahead of traditionally most polluted asian cities like beijing jakarta and delhi
reasons were various warm above average autumn and high difference between daily and night temperatures high atmospheric pressure lack of rain and wind massive stubble burning around the city and traffic pollution but experts claimed there is no need for panicking
still health recommendations were issued for both the healthy and ill citizens including to spend more time indoors as the city was covered in dirty fog
citizens then began to report fire and smoke on the landfill claiming it s one of the sources of the smog but this was denied by the authorities
even after photos and videos of the fires were posted denials continued
when reporters and several groups of activists wanted to visit the landfill and check the situation the police blocked access to the facility
authorities then admitted that there are fires but not open ones while minister trivan added this is not a rare occurrence and that soon everything will be under control
ombudsman zoran pa ali began proceedings regarding the way public was notified on the vin a fire by the administration
in january citizens again reported smoke from the landfill which coincided with one of the worst periods of pollution and smog in belgrade s history
authorities this time admitted immediately that the smoke but not the fire is a normal appearance in such type of landfills
as the mass wasting is now constantly active during each landslide the cracks open which release methane which in turn produces fumes and smoke
it was stated that the mobile units on the non stop watch are organized to deal with the problem when it appears
as media reported of new fires in february the authorities threatened that this is fake news and spreading of panic saying again it is normal for the landfill to smother all the time
they also stated that the dam which cost million was built in to prevent the draining of the polluted water into the danube though no one mentioned this dam before nor reported its construction
few weeks later it was said that the dam was finished in march
company administration threatened to sue anyone who continue to claim that the landfill is burning
in march despite the massive reduction of traffic in belgrade due to the coronavirus outbreak pollution in belgrade skyrocketed followed again with smell and haze despite the strong ko ava wind
head of one of the trade unions in the company gradska isto a which manages the landfill eljko veselinovi named the latest fire in vin a as one of the sources of the pollution
being accused of spreading fear and panic with false information head of the company announced criminal complaint against veselinovi repeating that all landfill processes are results of natural occurrences
in november private investors behind the massive reconstruction of the landfill admitted that the fires are frequent and constant
on april city manager goran vesi announced that the private strategic partner will be chosen to clean upgrade modernize and operate the landfill
he said that by june or july the invitation for tender will be opened and that the partner will be known by the end of the year
june was announced as the date when the contract should be signed while january was set as the date when the new waste to energy plant should open
companies applied but in the later phases that number fell down to or and the city officials vesi mayor mali deputy mayor andreja mladenovi also couldn t agree on the amount of the investment ranging from to million or the duration of the deal or years
in february vesi stated that the selection of the bidders is in the finishing phase and that in the first half of the strategic partner will be selected
on june during the fire mayor mali said that the vin a problem will be solved on july when the bids from the largest world companies will be opened
the date was moved to july and the deadline for selecting the partner to august
when the bids were opened on july it turned out there is only one french japanese consortium of suez itochu
if accepted even in the best case scenario no work will begin before the second half of
the ne davimo beograd movement which opposes the politics of the city administration and continuously organizes the protests and performances stated that the strategy partnerships for the landfills in long terms proves inefficient and unprofitable citing barcelona as an example
the city accepted the offer and the contract was signed on september
mayor mali stated that the project as a good investment and that contract is transparent
political opposition claimed that the contract may be even more scandalous than the one on belgrade waterfront and openly accused the administration that the entire project is just a scheme to drain money from the city
partial documentation though not the full contract have been handed to the city deputies and was posted online by the transparency serbia
the analysis of the city defender s office needed for the city to adopt the contract wasn t positive
city defender stated translation of the contract has not been done in accordance with the rules of serbian language and in case of different interpretations of the serbian and english versions precedence has the english version per article section a of the contract
the english version was not analyzed by the defender s office and the majority of the contract is not susceptible to changes
we are also noting that one contractual part is also functioning as an arbitration and that text of the contract uses legal terms which are not provided by the positive law therefore we are not in a position to confirm with certainty whether they are in accordance with the positive law
the deal includes the construction of an incineration plant
according to ne davimo beograd and environmentalist vladimir radoji i the incineration will cost citizens obligatory billion in the next years or million per year which is the amount paid to suez itochu by the contract
instead of making much lesser investments in promotion and expansion of recycling and construction of smaller recycle units which would employ hundreds of the poorest citizens city administration decided to pour huge amount of money to private investor
also city is denouncing a valuable resource of recycled garbage this way and is additionally polluting the air
strategic documents on the garbage management never envisioned the incineration plant quite the opposite
according to the reports the garbage will not be sorted prior to incineration so everything from the paints batteries pvc etc
will be burned
despite constant claims by the opponents of the project that city at the expense of its citizens will pay to the investor now a deputy mayor goran vesi stated that the project won t cost citizens a dime
but already in manager of the suez in serbia philippe thiel stated that payments from the city of belgrade to the newly formed company owned by the suez and the itochu will be significantly financed from the new special tax for waste management and on october a new item on the communal bill was added regarding the management of the waste
also the city will now collect communal bills from all city municipalities instead of only central as until that date
on october vesi announced that the works on the landfill makeover began
the existing landfill will be sanitized re cultivated and closed as concurrently the new landfill will be built
the combined waste treatment incineration plant will be built which would also produce electricity and heat from the waste
the planned power capacity is kw with treatment of tons of waste per hour
the energy will be available for the belgraders but the city will have to pay higher prices than the average
capacity is planned to tons yearly
another plant will treat the construction waste and rubble with the capacity of tons per year
treatment products will be reused in building road construction etc
there are plans for third and fourth treatment plants for water treatment which will then be used as technical water and for collecting landfill gases which will be used for energy production
biogas will be primarily used for energy production needed for the facilities on the landfill and the surplus will be distributed to the city
construction of the heat pipeline from vin a to the heating plant in belgrade s neighborhood of konjarnik also began
it is planned for the gas produced by the secondary waste separation process from the incineration plant which will be used for heating
in october european investment bank eib announced it refused to fund the incineration plant
after the internal evaluation the eib decided to concur with the negative findings of the european commission and to withdraw from the project
the bank stated the project is going to affect both the citizens of belgrade as the health risk and all citizens of serbia as the project is not in accordance with the european union negotiations chapter no
which would prevent serbia to join the eu
minister of environmental protection goran trivan said this was not true that the plant will be built by the highest european standards but that eib withdrew because of the politics
eu delegation in serbia then explained that incineration should be allowed only for the small part of the waste which can t be recycled or treated in any other way while by this project much larger quantities of waste will be burnt and that government should adjust the project
private investors said they will continue the funding
investors rebutted the claims on bad technology claiming the process when finished will provide much cleaner air in belgrade
the waste burning technology is the same as in europe facilities in european union and japan in tokyo
the reverse acting grate martin used for incineration is used in of waste to energy facilities
the smoke will be filtered by the selective non catalytic reduction system and emitted into the atmosphere from the m ft tall chimneys
the air will be constantly monitored
several klometers long pipeline and canals grid is built which will drain and collect both atmospheric precipitation and wastewater channeling it to the foothills of old landfill
there it will be treated by the reverse osmosis process and as the clear water conducted via the creek of o ljanski potok into the danube
in february the schedule of the works was announced waste treatment facility will be finished by mid april construction of the power plant on waste energy will start in the mid finishing of the wastewater treatment facility is set for the end of the entire project will be finished by the end of
the new sanitation landfill should be opened in early when the recovery of the old one will start
ha acres will be covered with m ft in thick layer of mineral materials but also by the geo synthetic membrane which will prevent water to reach inside the landfill but also to prevent carbon gases to spread out of it
the reclamation should be finished in after several stages in months
opening of the sanitation landfill was again postponed from september to january then to march
the main issue is the landslide of the old landfill especially a massive one in december when part of the road was also destroyed
in landslide occurred in the section of the new still unfinished landfill
this caused changes in the project and additional works so the opening was postponed for the second quarter of the year
old landfill was officially declared closed in august
it was announced in november that metres ft wide and kilometres mi long green belt will be formed around the landfill
a recent motion as a result of big economic and demographic discrepancy between the western and eastern parts of the municipality mentions vin a of the possible seat of the future municipality formed from the western part of the municipality of grocka comprising kalu erica bole le tane and ritopek
