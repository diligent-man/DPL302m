beauty and the beast is a song written by lyricist howard ashman and composer alan menken for the disney animated feature film beauty and the beast
the film s theme song the broadway inspired ballad was first recorded by british american actress angela lansbury in her role as the voice of the character mrs
potts and essentially describes the relationship between its two main characters belle and the beast specifically how the couple has learned to accept their differences and in turn change each other for the better
additionally the song s lyrics imply that the feeling of love is as timeless and ageless as a tale as old as time
lansbury s rendition is heard during the famous ballroom sequence between belle and the beast while a shortened chorale version plays in the closing scenes of the film and the song s motif features frequently in other pieces of menken s film score
lansbury was initially hesitant to record beauty and the beast because she felt that it was not suitable for her aging singing voice but ultimately completed the song in one take
beauty and the beast was subsequently recorded as a pop duet by canadian singer celine dion and american singer peabo bryson and released as the only single from the film s soundtrack on november
disney first recruited solely dion to record a radio friendly version of it in order to promote the film
however the studio was concerned that the then newcomer would not attract a large enough audience in the united states on her own so they hired the more prominent bryson to be her duet partner
at first dion was also hesitant to record beauty and the beast because she had just recently been fired from recording the theme song of the animated film an american tail fievel goes west
first heard during the film s end credits the single was produced by walter afanasieff who also arranged it with robbie buchanan and included on dion s self titled album and bryson s album through the fire
the single was accompanied by a music video
directed by dominic orlando it combined footage of the singers recording the song at the power station with excerpts from the film
both versions of beauty and the beast were very successful garnering both a golden globe and academy award for best original song as well as grammy awards for best song written for visual media and best pop performance by a duo or group with vocals
the single was also nominated for the grammy award for record of the year and the grammy award for song of the year
lansbury s performance has been universally lauded by both film and music critics
while the dion bryson version received mixed reviews from critics who felt that it was inferior to lansbury s original the single became a commercial success peaking at number nine on the billboard hot and becoming the better known of the two renditions
in addition to returning disney songs to the pop charts after a thirty year absence the success of beauty and the beast also boosted dion s career and established her as a bankable recording artist
after beauty and the beast became the first disney song to undergo a complete pop transformation several contemporary artists were inspired to release their own radio friendly renditions of disney songs throughout the decade
considered to be among disney s best and most popular songs beauty and the beast has since been covered by numerous artists
in the american film institute ranked beauty and the beast at number on their list of the greatest songs in american film history
the song is also featured in the live action adaptation sung by emma thompson as mrs
potts during the film and also as a duet cover version by ariana grande and john legend during the end credits
grande and legend s version of the song is an homage to the cover performed by dion and bryson for the film
beauty and the beast was written by lyricist howard ashman and composer alan menken in
intending for the song to be the height of simplicity the songwriters drew much of its influence from broadway music
due to ashman s failing health some of beauty and the beast s pre production was relocated to a hotel in fishkill new york near ashman s residence
of the songs he wrote for beauty and the beast menken devoted the most time to the title song
the track was first recorded by british american actress angela lansbury who voices the character mrs
potts an enchanted teapot
the songwriters first introduced beauty and the beast to lansbury as a demo recording which was accompanied by a note asking her if she might possibly be interested in singing it
although a seasoned film and stage performer who had previously done her own singing for disney in the musical film bedknobs and broomsticks lansbury who was more accustomed to performing uptempo songs was hesitant to record the ballad because of its unfamiliar rock style
although she liked the song lansbury also worried that her aging singing voice was no longer strong enough to record beauty and the beast and was especially concerned about having to sustain its longer notes
lansbury suggested that the songwriters ask someone else to sing beauty and the beast but they insisted that she simply sing the song the way she envisioned it
on october beauty and the beast was recorded in a studio in new york city accompanied by a live orchestra the songwriters preferred to have all performers and musicians record together as opposed to separating the singers from the instrumentalists
on the day of her scheduled recording session lansbury s flight was delayed due to a bomb threat which prompted an emergency landing in las vegas
unaware of her whereabouts for several hours the filmmakers had begun making plans to reschedule the session until lansbury finally telephoned the studio once she arrived safely in new york
at the behest of one of the directors lansbury recorded a demo of the song for them to use in the event that no other actress was available to sing it on her behalf or no character other than mrs
potts was deemed suitable
ultimately lansbury recorded her version in one take which wound up being used in the final film
producer don hahn recalled that the actress simply sang beauty and the beast from beginning to end and just nailed it
we picked up a couple of lines here and there but essentially that one take is what we used for the movie
lansbury s performance moved everyone who was present in the recording studio at the time to tears
lansbury credited recording the song with ultimately helping her gain further perspective on mrs
potts s role in the film
some of ashman s cut lyrics from the film were reinstated for the version in the film
the scene in beauty and the beast during which the song is heard is the moment when belle and the beast s true feelings for each other are finally established
set in the ballroom of the beast s castle beauty and the beast is performed by the character mrs
potts an enchanted teapot midway through the film as she explains the feeling of love to her young teacup son chip referring to the emotion as a tale as old as time
according to armen karaoghlanian of interiors belle familiarizes the beast with the waltz and as soon he feels comfortable he gracefully moves her across the floor
afterwards the song continues to play instrumentally as belle and the beast retire to the balcony for a romantic candlelit dinner
believed to be the centerpiece that brings beauty and her beast together the sequence offers an insight into both characters psyches
from the beast s perspective it is the moment he realizes that he wants to confess his true feelings for belle to her and decides he wants to tell belle he is in love with her
meanwhile belle begins to fall in love with her captor
writing for the globe and mail jennie punter reviewed it as the scene in which romance finally blossoms
film critic ellison estefan writing for estefan films believes that the sequence is responsible for add ing another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other
explaining the song s role in the film director kirk wise described the scene as the culmination of their relationship while producer don hahn pegged it as the bonding moment of the film when the two main characters finally get together
the scene had long been envisioned as having a more live action feel to it than the rest of the film an idea that originated from story artists brenda chapman and roger allers who were the first to suggest that the ballroom be built using computers
as the film s executive producer former head of disney s film division jeffrey katzenberg recalled that he began working on beauty and the beast deciding what its wowie moment would be defining this as the moment in the movie where you see what s on the screen and go wow iee this ultimately became the film s ballroom sequence
according to hahn the scene was conceived out of the filmmakers desire to manipulate the camera in order to sweep the audience away
allers and chapman conceived the ballroom in order to provide the characters with an area in which they could linger and were surprised by the amount of artistic freedom with which they were provided by the animators who agreed to adjust to the changes in perspective that would result from the moving camera
while allers decided to raise the camera in order to view the dancing couple from the overhead chandelier chapman decided to rotate the camera around belle s skirt as the couple danced past it
regarded as an example of a pronounced use of height and of vertical movement in sets and settings in virtual camera movement
and in the actions of characters by epics spectacles and blockbusters a hollywood history author sheldon hall beauty and the beast was one of the first feature length animated films to use computer generated imagery which is prominently exhibited throughout the film s elaborate ballroom sequence
light science physics and the visual arts author thomas d
rossing believes that the filmmakers aimed to achieve a moving perspective that would follow the dancers around the room giving visual expression to the soaring emotions of the scene
cgi supervisor jim hillin was hired by hahn to oversee the design of the scene s graphics
however because the computer animation medium was so unfamiliar to the filmmakers at the time at one point they had considered having belle and the beast simply dance in complete darkness save for a single spotlight should the project be unsuccessful they jokingly referred to this idea as the ice capades version
first rendered as a simple cube the filmmakers used computers to design the ballroom as a production set making it the first full dimensional computer generated colored background in history
unlike disney s previous cgi ventures beauty and the beast s ballroom was a much more detailed task that required animators to work exclusively with computers to compose animate and color the scene
according to hillin the revolutionary use of computers allowed for a combination of theatrical lighting and sweeping perspectives which ultimately introduced live action techniques to animation
to make the scene a special moment for the characters a virtual camera was used to allow the animators to create the illusion of tracking panning and zooming that establish es the mood while helping audiences experience what the characters themselves are experiencing
imitating tracking shots the camera frequently soars and zooms around the couple
the camera first follows belle and the beast as they enter the ballroom before panning until it finally returns to focus on the two characters
in his book basics animation digital animation author andrew chong wrote that the sweeping camera move with a constantly shifting perspective during the ballroom sequence was a composition of traditionally drawn elements for the characters with digitally animated scenery
several computer animators layout artists art directors and background artists used their combined efforts to achieve the scene s end results the ballroom s official dimensions read feet high feet long and feet wide
the space also houses windows and a dome that measures by feet the dome s mural was first hand painted before it was texture mapped onto it using a computer
each element was carefully constructed individually
timothy wegner described the finished product in his book image lab as a huge and elegant ballroom in which the walls are decorated with elaborate moldings corinthian columns and hundreds of candles
writing for combustible celluloid jeffrey m
anderson believes that the animators understood that the new technology couldn t be used to represent organic beings so they simply used it for backgrounds i e
the swirling spinning ballroom during the beauty and the beast dance number
at first belle and the beast were vaguely represented by computer animated box and egg shaped stand ins in order to choreograph their dance while the ballroom was still little more than a chicken wire frame
andrew osmond author of animated feature films described this crude depiction of the characters as wire frames moving in staccato
the characters were eventually updated to stiff line drawn versions of themselves
because belle and the beast are so interconnected during this scene both characters were animated solely by belle s supervising animator james baxter the beast s supervising animator glen keane eventually traced over baxter s work
baxter prepared himself for animating the scene by studying ballet dancers in addition to taking dance lessons himself
throughout the entire film belle moves with a ballerina s turnout the los angeles times film critic charles solomon observed that belle looks liveliest and prettiest during this scene
at one point both baxter and keane plotted out their characters routine themselves under the guidance of a professional dance coach
a software created by pixar named caps computer animation production system allowed the animators to paint belle and the beast using computers as opposed to the more conventional and time consuming method of painting animated characters by hand
art director brian mcentee suggested a blue and gold colour scheme for the characters costumes at a late night meeting because he felt that the colors were compelling and regal
adhering to the ballroom s blue and gold color scheme belle s gold ballgown complements the trim on the beast s tuxedo as well as the color of the ballroom itself while the beast s royal blue attire complements his eyes the night sky the curtains and the floor tiles
meanwhile julia alexander of movie mezzanine wrote that the elegance of their costumes against the background of a golden hall and a star filled sky adds to the whimsical romanticism of the movie
the entire sequence took several months to complete much of which was spent syncing the traditionally animated couple with their computer animated environment which otherwise would have been virtually impossible had the filmmakers decided to use a more traditional method
when beauty and the beast was released many animators were impressed with the studio for pushing the envelope while some considered the scene to be a miserable failure accusing its new technology of distracting from the moment
describing the scene as an early experiment in computer animation josh larsen of larsen on film observed that the ballroom sequence features the camera swooping in and around to provide an expansive sense of space that d still isn t able to capture
in her book the beautiful ache author leigh mcleroy wrote that the scene represents one of those strange moments where love creeps in against all odds and insists on staying put
audiences tend to remember the ballroom sequence as the one in which belle and the beast share a romantic dance as the camera files and spins around them
angela lansbury recalled being astonished when she first saw the huge and unique scene
in moviepilot s chris lucas opinion the ballroom scene remains the one that truly symbolizes their adoration for each other
ign believes that the scene signals the completion of the beast s inner change from irascible recluse into belle s true love
the original film version of beauty and the beast performed by lansbury was written in the key of d flat major at a moderately slow tempo of beats per minute andante at a duration of two minutes and forty six seconds
an eloquent rock influenced pop song with a calm and lilting melody stephen whitty of nj com described beauty and the beast as a broadway ballad

writing for the chicago tribune gene siskel described lansbury s voice which spans two octaves from f to b as richly textured
meanwhile michael cheang of the star and bill gibron of popmatters wrote that lansbury performed using a fragile calm motherly tone
instrumentally beauty and the beast features several chord changes woodwinds and violins
gamesradar observed that beauty and the beast includes a key change during which the music swells and then the orchestra subsides to leave just trembling violins

shaffer of ign identified beauty and the beast as a tear jerking poetic ballad

we don t know we re in love until we spend time with someone and unforced adjustments make the pieces fall into place

without minimizing or mocking its inherently sweet description of true love

entertainment weekly s darren franich however admitted to preferring be our guest and belle over beauty and the beast
the ballroom sequence during which belle and the beast dance to beauty and the beast continues to be praised especially for its use of computer animation
the first time the beauty and the beast musical sequence was made available to the public it was in the form of an unfinished scene at the new york film festival in september to which disney had been invited to premiere an incomplete version of beauty and the beast that largely consisted of uncolored pencil tests and storyboards
the new york times janet maslin appreciated being previewed to the unfinished ballroom scene writing when the radiant sight of beauty and the beast waltzing together to the sound of the lilting theme song by alan menken and howard ashman stirs emotion even in this sketchy form then both the power and the artifice of animation make themselves felt

although boxoffice s todd gilchrist s response towards the film s d conversion overall was mixed the critic admitted that the times when the animators use computer animation to render the backgrounds including during the dance sequence between belle and beast
are effective immersive and maybe even memorable
contrastingly chris hicks of the deseret news felt that today the ballroom sequence no longer feels fresh and new after so many recent computer animated d efforts but that doesn t diminish the power of its gorgeous design
although james berardinelli of reelviews had originally reviewed the sequence as the best scene in the movie he felt that the d conversion diminishes the romance and emotion of the ballroom dance
to viewers at the time the computer effects in this climactic sequence were astonishing
the beauty and the beast ballroom sequence thematized marriage in the dance by illustrating a nuptial rehearsal which contrasts the now d animation with then d animation in a successful marriage of character and set
the studios after the studios explains this chronological fusion was itself classicised by mrs potts song she turns a moment of industrial novelty into balance

what a song
much to disney s surprise beauty and the beast received three separate academy award nominations for best original song
to avoid dividing academy voters and prevent a draw disney decided to promote the film s title song ahead of its fellow nominees belle and be our guest by releasing beauty and the beast as a single similar to the way in which universal pictures released somewhere out there from the animated film an american tail as a single in
coincidentally ashman and menken had written the song so that it could potentially experience success outside of the beauty and the beast film itself
although lansbury s rendition was very much appreciated it was considered to be unsuitable for a commercial release or radio airplay
thus the studio decided to make beauty and the beast the first disney song to be arranged into a pop version of itself for the film s end credits
menken referred to this experience as a turning point in his career because it was also the first time one of his own compositions had ever undergone such a transformation
the song was produced by walter afanasieff and arranged by musician robbie buchanan
menken commended afanasieff for successfully making the song his own
actress and singer paige o hara who voices belle was among the first artists to express interest in recording the pop version of beauty and the beast but disney dismissed her for being too broadway
unable to afford to hire a big singer at the time disney hired rising canadian recording artist celine dion
because she was relatively unknown to american audiences at the time the studio doubted that dion would have much of an impact in the united states on her own and subsequently hired the more well known american singer peabo bryson to perform the song alongside her as a duet
disney contacted dion s manager ren ang lil about having the singer record beauty and the beast while she was on tour in england
a fan of dion s music menken personally wrote the singer a letter of approval
hailing from the french canadian province of quebec dion had just begun to learn english
at first dion was hesitant to commit to the project due to having just recently been replaced from recording dreams to dream the theme song of the animated film an american tail fievel goes west in favor of american singer linda ronstadt who had previously experienced great success with her rendition of somewhere out there
ronstadt who was producer steven spielberg s first choice only agreed to record dreams to dream after hearing dion s demo
devastated by her termination dion eventually agreed to record beauty and the beast after listening to and being moved by lansbury s performance
meanwhile bryson became involved with the project via walt disney records senior vice president jay landers who was friends with walt disney pictures president of music chris montan at the time
the song s instruments were recorded first at the plant recording studios in california
the singers later quickly recorded their vocals at the power station in new york over the labor day long weekend while mixing was completed at the record plant in los angeles
the song was released as the only single from the film s soundtrack on which the song appears alongside lansbury s version on november by walt disney records sony music s labels columbia records and epic records
the single is a pop ballad that lasts a total of four minutes and three seconds
it begins in the key of f major at a moderately slow tempo of beats per minute before modulating to d major then g major and ending in e major
the orchestration of the conservatively rendered pop song as described by filmtracks includes an electric oboe keyboard synthesizer and acoustic guitar
additionally the song s jazzy instrumentation heavily relies on drums an instrument that is noticeably absent from the remainder of the soundtrack
according to molly lambert of grantland the track is a sweeping downtempo
ballad that evokes the early s gossamer high tech style while molly horan of refinery described it as a slow jam
according to the chicago tribune s brad webber dion and bryson s vocals are resonant and multiflavored
the opening line tale as old as time is preceded by dion ad libbing ooh
similarities have been drawn between the song and somewhere out there from the animated film an american tail
unlike lansbury s version the dion bryson single has earned generally mixed reviews critics generally voice their preference for lansbury s version over dion and bryson s
filmtracks com wrote that dion s performance made many fans wish that she had been given it as a solo
arion berger of entertainment weekly praised dion s vocals describing beauty and the beast as a perfect showcase for what she s best at
describing the duet as extremely effective sputnikmusic s irving tan lauded the single writing as the entirety of the film s poignancy is hinged on the chemistry between bryson and dion having the pair pull their assignment off beautifully is ultimately a fantastic conclusion to events
jeff benjamin of fuse described the song as a fantastic duet
however the chicago tribune s brad webber panned the rendition as a sickly sweet by the book
standard that belie s dion s talent while the star s michael cheang accused the single of being over wrought
critics have been vocal in their preference for lansbury s rendition while praising the film version spin s andrew unterberger dismissed the single as unbearably cloying
similarly kristian lin of fort worth weekly panned the single while complimenting lansbury s version advising audience members to clear out of the theater before celine dion and peabo bryson butcher the title song over the end credits while consequence of sound s dan caffrey felt that it s a shame that the most globally known version of beauty and the beast is the one sang by celine dion and peabo bryson as opposed to the one sung by lansbury
at the th grammy awards beauty and the beast won the award for best pop performance by a duo or group with vocals
additionally the song was nominated for record of the year and song of the year but lost both to eric clapton s tears in heaven
