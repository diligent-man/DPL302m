the history of washington d c is tied to its role as the capital of the united states
originally inhabited by an algonquian speaking people known as the nacotchtank the site of the district of columbia along the potomac river was first selected by president george washington
the city came under attack during the war of in an episode known as the burning of washington
upon the government s return to the capital it had to manage the reconstruction of numerous public buildings including the white house and the united states capitol
the mcmillan plan of helped restore and beautify the downtown core area including establishing the national mall along with numerous monuments and museums
unique among cities with a high percentage of african americans washington has had a significant black population since the city s creation
as a result washington became both a center of african american culture and a center of the civil rights movement
since the city government was run by the u s
federal government black and white school teachers were paid at an equal scale as workers for the federal government
it was not until the administration of woodrow wilson a southern democrat who had numerous southerners in his cabinet that federal offices and workplaces were segregated starting in
this situation persisted for decades the city was racially segregated in certain facilities until the s
today d c
is marked by contrasts
neighborhoods on the eastern periphery of the central city and east of the anacostia river tend to be disproportionately lower income
following world war ii many middle income whites moved out of the city s central and eastern sections to newer affordable suburban housing with commuting eased by highway construction
the assassination of martin luther king jr
in memphis tennessee on april sparked major riots in chiefly african american neighborhoods east of rock creek park
large sections of the central city remained blighted for decades
by contrast areas west of the park including virtually the entire portion of the district between the georgetown and chevy chase neighborhoods the latter of which spills into neighboring chevy chase maryland contain some of the nation s most affluent and notable neighborhoods
during the early th century the u street corridor served as an important center for african american culture in dc
the washington metro opened in
a rising economy and gentrification in the late s and early s led to the revitalization of many downtown neighborhoods
article one section of the united states constitution places the district which is not a state under the exclusive legislation of congress
throughout its history washington d c
residents have therefore lacked voting representation in congress
the twenty third amendment to the united states constitution ratified in gave the district three electoral votes thus implicitly authorised it to hold an election for president and vice president
the district of columbia home rule act provided the local government more control of affairs including direct election of the city council and mayor
archaeological evidence indicates american indians settled in the area at least years ago around the anacostia river
early european exploration of the region took place early in the th century including explorations by captain john smith in
at the time the patawomeck loosely affiliated with the powhatan and the doeg lived on the virginia side as well as on theodore roosevelt island while the piscataway also known as conoy tribe of algonquians resided on the maryland side
native inhabitants within the present day district of columbia included the nacotchtank at anacostia who were affiliated with the conoy
another village was located between little falls and georgetown and english fur trader henry fleet documented a nacotchtank village called tohoga on the site of present day georgetown
the first colonial landowners in the present day district of columbia were george thompson and thomas gerrard who were granted the blue plains tract in along with saint elizabeth and other tracts in anacostia capitol hill and other areas down to the potomac river in the following years
thompson sold his capitol hill properties in including duddington manor to thomas notley the duddington property was handed down over the generations to daniel carroll of duddington
as european settlers arrived they clashed with the native americans over grazing rights
in maryland authorities built a fort within what is now the district of columbia
in that same year the conoy relocated to the west near what is now the plains virginia and in they moved again to conoy island near point of rocks maryland
georgetown was established in when the maryland general assembly purchased sixty acres of land for the town from george gordon and george beall at the price of while alexandria virginia was founded in
situated on the fall line georgetown was the farthest point upstream to which oceangoing boats could navigate the potomac river
the strong flow of the potomac kept a navigable channel clear year round and the daily tidal lift of the chesapeake bay raised the potomac s elevation in its lower reach such that fully laden ocean going ships could navigate easily all the way to the bay
gordon had constructed a tobacco inspection house along the potomac in approximately
warehouses wharves and other buildings were added and the settlement rapidly grew
the old stone house located in georgetown was built in and is the oldest standing building in the district
it did not take long before georgetown grew into a thriving port facilitating trade and shipments of tobacco and other goods from colonial maryland
with the economic and population growth of georgetown also came the founding of georgetown university in at its founding drawing students from as far away as the west indies
the united states capital was originally located in philadelphia beginning with the first and second continental congress followed by the congress of the confederation upon ratification of the first federal constitution
in june a mob of angry soldiers converged upon independence hall to demand payment for their service during the american revolutionary war
congress requested that john dickinson the governor of pennsylvania call up the militia to defend congress from attacks by the protesters
in what became known as the pennsylvania mutiny of dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from philadelphia
as a result congress was forced to flee to princeton new jersey on june
on october while still in princeton congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole to take into consideration respecting a place for the permanent residence of congress
the following day elbridge gerry of massachusetts motioned that buildings for the use of congress be erected on the banks of the delaware near trenton or of the potomac near georgetown provided a suitable district can be procured on one of the rivers as aforesaid for a federal town
dickinson s failure to protect the institutions of the national government was discussed at the philadelphia convention in
the delegates therefore agreed in article one section of the united states constitution to give the congress the power
to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district not exceeding ten miles square as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of forts magazines arsenals dock yards and other needful buildings james madison writing in federalist no
also argued that the national capital needed to be distinct from the states in order to provide for its own maintenance and safety
the constitution however does not select a specific site for the location of the new district
proposals from the legislatures of maryland new jersey new york and virginia all offered territory for the national capital location
northern states preferred a capital located in one of the nation s prominent cities unsurprisingly almost all of which were in the north
conversely southern states preferred that the capital be located closer to their agricultural and slave holding interests
the selection of the area around the potomac river which was the boundary between maryland and virginia both slave states was agreed upon between james madison thomas jefferson and alexander hamilton
hamilton had a proposal for the new federal government to take over debts accrued by the states during the revolutionary war
however by southern states had largely repaid their overseas debts
hamilton s proposal would require southern states to assume a share of northern debt
jefferson and madison agreed to this proposal and in return secured a southern location for the federal capital
on december the maryland general assembly passed an act allowing it to cede land for the federal district
the virginia general assembly followed suit on december
the signing of the federal residence act on july mandated that the site for the permanent seat of government not exceeding ten miles square square miles be located on the river potomack at some place between the mouths of the eastern branch and connogochegue
the eastern branch is known today as the anacostia river
the connogocheque conococheague creek empties into the potomac river upstream near williamsport and hagerstown maryland
the residence act limited to the maryland side of the potomac river the location of land that commissioners appointed by the president could acquire for federal use
the residence act authorized the president to select the actual location of the site
however president george washington wished to include the town of alexandria virginia within the federal district
to accomplish this the boundaries of the federal district would need to encompass an area on the potomac that was downstream of the mouth of the eastern branch
the u s
congress amended the residence act in to permit alexandria s inclusion in the federal district
however some members of congress had recognized that president george washington and his family owned property in and near alexandria which was just seven miles km upstream from mount vernon washington s home and plantation
the amendment therefore contained a provision that prohibited the erection of the public buildings otherwise than on the maryland side of the river potomac
the final site was just below the fall line on the potomac the furthest inland point navigable by boats see atlantic seaboard fall line
it included the ports of georgetown and alexandria
the process of establishing the federal district however faced other challenges in the form of strong objections from landowners such as david burns who owned a large acre ha tract of land in the heart of the district
on march burns and eighteen other key landowners relented and signed an agreement with washington where they would be compensated for any land taken for public use half of the remaining land would be distributed among the proprietors and the other half to the public
pursuant to the residence act president washington appointed three commissioners thomas johnson daniel carroll and david stuart in to supervise the planning design and acquisition of property in the federal district and capital city
in september using the toponym columbia and the name of the president the three commissioners agreed to name the federal district as the territory of columbia and the federal city as the city of washington
on march washington issued a presidential proclamation that established jones s point the upper cape of hunting creek in virginia as the starting point for the federal district s boundary survey
the proclamation also described the method by which the survey should determine the district s boundaries
working under the general supervision of the three commissioners and at the direction of president washington major andrew ellicott assisted by his brothers benjamin and joseph ellicott isaac roberdeau isaac briggs george fenwick and initially an african american astronomer benjamin banneker then proceeded to survey the borders of the territory of columbia with virginia and maryland during and
the survey team enclosed within a square an area containing the full square miles km that the residence act had authorized
each side of the square was miles km long
the axes between the corners of the square ran north south and east west
the center of the square is within the grounds of the organization of american states headquarters west of the ellipse
the survey team placed forty sandstone boundary markers at or near every mile point along the sides of the square see boundary markers of the original district of columbia
thirty six of these markers still remain
the south cornerstone is at jones point
the west cornerstone is at the west corner of arlington county virginia
the north cornerstone is south of east west highway near silver spring maryland west of th street
the east cornerstone is east of the intersection of southern avenue and eastern avenue
on january andrew ellicott submitted to the commissioners a report that stated that the boundary survey had been completed and that all of the boundary marker stones had been set in place
ellicott s report described the marker stones and contained a map that showed the boundaries and topographical features of the territory of columbia
the map identified the locations within the territory of the planned city of washington and its major streets and the location of each boundary marker stone
in early president washington appointed pierre peter charles l enfant to devise a plan for the new city in an area of land at the center of the federal territory that lay between the northeast shore of the potomac river and the northwest shore of the potomac s eastern branch
l enfant then designed in his plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of the united states
the city s first layout a grid centered on the united states capitol which would stand at the top of a hill jenkins hill on a longitude designated as
the grid filled an area bounded by the potomac river the eastern branch now named the anacostia river the base of an escarpment at the atlantic seaboard fall line along which a street initially boundary street now florida avenue would later travel and rock creek
north south and east west streets formed the grid
wider diagonal grand avenues later named after the states of the union crossed the grid
where these grand avenues crossed each other l enfant placed open spaces in circles and plazas that were later named after notable americans
l enfant s broadest grand avenue was a foot wide m garden lined esplanade which he expected to travel for about mile km along an east west axis in the center of an area that the national mall now occupies
a narrower avenue pennsylvania avenue connected the congress house the capitol with the president s house the white house
in time pennsylvania avenue developed into the capital city s present grand avenue
l enfant s plan included a system of canals one of which would travel near the western side of the capitol at the base of jenkins hill
to be filled by the waters of tiber creek also named goose creek and james creek the canal system would traverse the center of the city and would enter both the potomac river and the eastern branch see washington city canal
on june l enfant presented his first plan for the federal city to the president
on august he appended a new map to a letter that he sent to the president
president washington retained one of l enfant s plans showed it to congress and later gave it to the three commissioners
the survey map may be one that l enfant appended to his august letter to the president
l enfant subsequently entered into a number of conflicts with the three commissioners and others involved in the enterprise
during a contentious period in february andrew ellicott who had been conducting the original boundary survey of the future district of columbia see boundary markers of the original district of columbia and the survey of the federal city under the direction of the commissioners informed the commissioners that l enfant had not been able to have the city plan engraved and had refused to provide him with the original plan of which l enfant had prepared several versions
ellicott with the aid of his brother benjamin ellicott then revised the plan despite l enfant s protests
ellicott s revisions which included the straightening of the longer avenues and the removal of square no
from l enfant s original plan created minor changes to the city s layout
ellicott stated in his letters that although he was refused the original plan he was familiar with l enfant s system and had many notes of the surveys that he had made himself
it is therefore possible that ellicott recreated the plan
shortly thereafter washington dismissed l enfant
ellicott gave the first version of his own plan to james thakara and john vallance of philadelphia who engraved printed and published it
this version printed in march was the first washington city plan that received wide circulation
after l enfant departed ellicott continued the city survey in accordance with his revised plan several larger and more detailed versions of which were also engraved published and distributed
as a result ellicott s revisions became the basis for the capital city s future development
in the seat of government was finally moved to the new city and on february the district of columbia organic act of placed the district under the jurisdiction of congress
the act also organized the unincorporated territory within the district into two counties the county of washington on the northeast bank of the potomac and the county of alexandria on the southwest bank
on may the city of washington was granted a municipal government consisting of a mayor appointed by the president of the united states
the district of columbia relied on congress to support capital improvements and economic development initiatives
however congress lacked loyalty to the city s residents and was reluctant to provide support
congress did provide funding for the washington city canal in after earlier private financing efforts were unsuccessful
construction began in and the canal opened in late connecting the anacostia river with tiber creek
construction of the chesapeake and ohio canal c o began in georgetown in
construction westward through maryland proceeded slowly
the first section from georgetown to seneca maryland opened in
in an extension was built from georgetown eastward connecting to the city canal
the c o reached cumberland maryland in although by that time it was obsolete as the baltimore and ohio railroad b o had arrived in cumberland in
the canal had financial problems and plans for further construction to reach the ohio river were abandoned
during the war of the british army conducted an expedition between august and that took and burned the capital city
in the battle of bladensburg on august the british routed an american militia which had gathered at bladensburg maryland to protect the capital
the militia then abandoned washington without a fight
president james madison and the remainder of the u s
government fled the capital shortly before the british arrived
the british then entered and burned the capital during the most notably destructive raid of the war
british troops set fire to the capital s most important public buildings including the presidential mansion the white house the united states capitol the arsenal the navy yard the treasury building and the war office as well as the north end of the long bridge which crossed the potomac river into virginia
the british however spared the patent office and the marine barracks
dolley madison the first lady or perhaps members of the house staff rescued the lansdowne portrait a full length painting of george washington by gilbert stuart as the british approached the mansion
the aftermath of the war kicked off a mild crisis with many northerners pushing for a relocation of the capitol with a vote brought to the floor of congress proposing the removal of the government to philadelphia
it was defeated to votes and the seat of government remained in washington d c
the b o opened a rail line from baltimore to washington in
passenger traffic on the washington branch had increased by the s as the company opened a large station in on new jersey avenue nw just north of the capitol
further railroad development continued after the civil war with a new b o line the metropolitan branch connecting washington to the west and the introduction of competition from the baltimore and potomac railroad in the s
in union station opened as the city s central terminal
almost immediately after the federal city was laid out north of the potomac some residents south of the potomac in alexandria county d c began petitioning to be returned to virginia s jurisdiction
over time a larger movement grew to separate alexandria from the district for several reasons
alexandria was a center for slave trading
there was increasing talk of abolition of slavery in the national capital
alexandria s economy would suffer if slavery were outlawed in the district of columbia
in congressman abraham lincoln submitted a bill to abolish slavery within the district which failed
there was an active abolition movement in virginia the pro slavery faction held a slim majority in the virginia general assembly
if alexandria and alexandria county were retroceded to virginia they would provide two new pro slavery representatives
alexandria s economy had stagnated as competition with the port of georgetown d c had begun to favor the north side of the potomac where most members of congress and local federal officials resided
the residence act prohibited federal offices from locating in virginia
the alexandria canal which connected the c o canal to alexandria needed repairs which the federal government was reluctant to fund after a referendum alexandria county s citizens petitioned congress and virginia to return the area to virginia
by an act of congress on july and with the approval of the virginia general assembly the area south of the potomac square miles or square kilometers was returned or retroceded to virginia effective in
the retroceded land was then known as alexandria county virginia and now includes a portion of the independent city of alexandria and all of arlington county the successor to alexandria county
a large portion of the retroceded land near the river was an estate of george washington parke custis who had supported the retrocession and helped develop the charter in the virginia general assembly for the county of alexandria virginia
the estate arlington plantation would be passed on to his daughter the wife of robert e
lee and would eventually become arlington national cemetery
a portion of the washington aqueduct opened in providing drinking water to city residents and reducing their dependence on well water
the aqueduct built by the us army corps of engineers opened for full operation in using the potomac river as its source
washington remained a small city of a few thousand residents virtually deserted during the summertime until the outbreak of the american civil war in
president abraham lincoln created the army of the potomac to defend the federal capital and thousands of soldiers came to the area
the significant expansion of the federal government to administer the war and its legacies such as veterans pensions led to notable growth in the city s population from in to in
slavery was abolished throughout the district on april eight months before lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation with the passage of the compensated emancipation act
the city became a popular place for freed slaves to congregate
throughout the war the city was defended by a ring of union army forts that mostly deterred the confederate army from attacking
one notable exception was the battle of fort stevens in july in which union soldiers repelled troops under the command of confederate general jubal a
early
this battle was only the second time a u s
president came under enemy fire during wartime when lincoln visited the fort to observe the fighting
the first had been james madison during the war of meanwhile over sick and injured union soldiers were treated in various permanent and temporary hospitals in the capital
on april just days after the end of the war lincoln was shot in ford s theatre by john wilkes booth during the play our american cousin
the next morning at am president lincoln died in the petersen house across the street the first american president to be assassinated
secretary of war edwin m
stanton said now he belongs to the ages
by the district s population had grown from the previous census to nearly residents
despite the city s growth washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation
the situation was so bad that some members of congress suggested moving the capital further west but president ulysses s
grant refused to consider such a proposal
in response to the poor conditions in the capital congress passed the organic act of which revoked the individual charters of the cities of washington and georgetown and created a new territorial government for the whole district of columbia
the act provided for a governor appointed by the president a legislative assembly with an upper house composed of eleven appointed council members and a member house of delegates elected by residents of the district as well as an appointed board of public works charged with modernizing the city
president grant appointed alexander robey shepherd an influential member of the board of public works to the post of governor in
shepherd authorized large scale municipal projects which greatly modernized washington
however the governor spent three times the money that had been budgeted for capital improvements
he ultimately bankrupted the city
in congress abolished the district s territorial government and replaced it with a three member board of commissioners appointed by the president of which one was a representative from the united states army corps of engineers
the three commissioners would then elect one of themselves to be president of the commission
an additional act of congress in made the three member board of commissioners the permanent government of the district of columbia
the act also had the effect of eliminating any remaining local institutions such as the boards on schools health and police
the commissioners would maintain this form of direct rule for nearly a century
the first motorized streetcars in the district began service in and spurred growth in areas beyond the city of washington s original boundaries
in congress required that all new developments within the district conform to the layout of the city of washington
the city of washington s northern border of boundary street was renamed florida avenue in reflecting growth of suburban areas in the county of washington
the city s streets were extended throughout the district starting in
an additional law passed in mandated that washington formally absorb georgetown which until then had maintained a nominal separate identity and renamed its streets
with a consolidated government and the transformation of suburban areas within the district into urban neighborhoods the entire city eventually took on the name washington d c
in the early s the washington city canal was covered over
originally an expansion of tiber creek the canal connected the capitol with the potomac running along the north side of the mall where constitution avenue is today
however as the nation transitioned over to railroads for its transport the canal had become nothing more than a stagnant sewer and so it was removed
some reminders of the canal still exist
south of the capitol a road named canal street connects independence avenue sw and e street se although the northernmost section of the street was renamed washington avenue to commemorate the state of washington
a lock keeper s house built in at the eastern terminal of the c o canal where the c o emptied into tiber creek and the potomac river remains at the southwest corner of constitution avenue nw formerly b street nw and th street nw see lockkeeper s house c o canal extension
the western end of the city canal emptied into the potomac and connected with the c o canal near the lock keeper s house
one of the most important washington architects of this period was the german immigrant adolf cluss
from the s to the s he constructed over public and private buildings throughout the city including the national museum the agriculture department sumner and franklin schools
the washington monument a tribute to george washington and the world s tallest stone structure was completed in
in the senate park improvement commission of the district of columbia the mcmillan commission which congress had formed the previous year formulated the mcmillan plan an architectural plan for the redevelopment of the national mall
the commission was inspired by l enfant s plan for the city which had not been fully realized
the members of the commission also sought to emulate the grandeur of european capitals such as paris london and rome
they were also strongly influenced by the city beautiful movement a progressive ideology that intended to build civic virtue in the poor through important monumental architecture
several of the commission members including daniel burnham and frederick law olmsted jr
had in fact participated in the world columbian exposition which was widely popular and helped to spread interest in the city beautiful movement
the mcmillan plan in many respects was an early form of urban renewal that removed many of the slums that surrounded the united states capitol replacing them with new public monuments and government buildings
the plan proposed a redesign of the national mall and the construction of the future burnham designed union station
world war i interrupted the execution of the plan but construction of the lincoln memorial in largely completed it
although the mcmillan plan resulted in the demolition of some slums in the federal triangle area substandard housing was a much larger problem in the city during the early s with large portions of the population living in so called alley dwellings progressive efforts eventually led to the creation of the alley dwelling authority in
the agency led by john ihlder was an early example of a public housing agency and was responsible for demolishing slum housing and building new units that were affordable modern and sanitary
during his first administration which started in president woodrow wilson introduced segregation into several federal departments for the first time since
he supported some cabinet appointees in their request to segregate employees and create separate lunchrooms and restrooms
he was highly criticized for this especially as he had attracted numerous votes from blacks
the policy held for decades
one advantage of federal rule over the district of columbia was that the public school teachers were considered federal workers
although the schools were segregated black and white teachers were paid on an equal scale
the system attracted highly qualified teachers especially for the m street school later called dunbar high school the academic high school for african americans
in july whites including uniformed u s
armed forces sailors and soldiers attacked blacks in washington during red summer when violence broke out in cities across the country
the catalyst in washington was the rumored arrest of a black man for rape in four days of mob violence white men randomly beat black people on the street and pulled others off streetcars for attacks
when police refused to intervene the black population fought back
troops tried to restore order as the city closed saloons and theaters but a summer rainstorm had a more dampening effect
fifteen people were killed whites including two police officers and five blacks
fifty people were seriously wounded and another less severely wounded
the naacp protested to president woodrow wilson
in washington was hit by its deadliest natural disaster when the knickerbocker storm dumped inches cm of snow causing the roof to collapse at the knickerbocker theater a silent movie house
ninety eight people were killed including a u s
congressman were injured
on july president herbert hoover ordered the united states army to forcibly evict the bonus army of world war i veterans who gathered in washington d c to secure promised veterans benefits early
troops dispersed the last of the bonus army the next day
during the great depression of the s the city s population grew rapidly with the creation of additional federal agencies under the new deal programs of president franklin d
roosevelt during which most of the federal triangle buildings were constructed
though washington was still administered by politicians uninterested in the well being of the local population in the late s the chairman of the house subcommittee on district appropriations ross a
collins from mississippi cut spending on local dc funds for welfare and education stating that my constituents wouldn t stand for spending money on niggers
world war ii brought further population increases more than between and and a significant housing shortage as existing residents were urged to rent rooms to the influx of federal staffers who arrived from throughout the country
it is a terrible place to live life magazine wrote in the city s infrastructure was unable to grow as fast as the population and residents had to wait in long lines for food transportation shopping entertainment and almost every other area of life
during the war as many as railroad passengers passed through union station in a single day
the pentagon was built in nearby arlington to efficiently consolidate federal defense offices under one roof
one of the largest office buildings in the world it was built rapidly during the early years of the war partially opening in and complete in
the city experienced a brief intensification of racial segregation in after the appointment of senator theodore g
bilbo a radical segregationist southern democrat from mississippi as chairman of the senate committee on the district of columbia in
bilbo who sought to transform the district into a model city strengthened segregation in the city s workplaces parks and national airport
president harry truman ended de jure racial discrimination in the armed forces and federal workplaces in
parks and recreation facilities in washington remained segregated until
public schools were desegregated soon after
when the city s board of education began building the john phillip sousa junior high a group of parents from the anacostia neighborhood petitioned to have the school admit black and white students
when it was constructed the board declared that only whites could enroll
the parents sued in a case decided in the landmark supreme court ruling bolling v
sharpe
partly due to the district s unique status under the constitution the court decided unanimously that all of d c s public schools had to be integrated
in the wake of this and the landmark supreme court case brown v
board of education the eisenhower administration decided to make d c
schools the first to integrate as an example to the rest of the nation
in washington became the first major city in the nation with a majority african american population
like many cities it had received thousands of black people from the south in the great migration starting during world war i and accelerating in the s and s
with the buildup of government and defense industries during world war ii many new residents found jobs
in the postwar years whites who were better established economically began to move to newer housing in adjoining states in the suburbanization movement that occurred around most major cities
they were aided by the extensive highway construction undertaken by federal and state governments
on august washington took center stage in the civil rights movement with the march on washington for jobs and freedom and dr
martin luther king jr s famed i have a dream speech at the lincoln memorial
following king s assassination on april in memphis washington was devastated by the riots that broke out in the u street neighborhood and spread to other black areas including columbia heights
the civil unrest drove many whites and middle class blacks to move out of the city core
there had already been a steady movement of some residents to suburban locations searching for newer housing and avoiding school integration
in the late s and early s many businesses left the downtown and inner city areas drawn to suburban malls and following residential development
marks of riots scarred some neighborhoods into the late s
the district elects a delegate to the house of representatives who has the usual rights of house membership such as seniority and committee membership except that the delegate cannot formally vote

the kennedy center opened and several new museums and historical monuments on and around the national mall
in congress sent the district of columbia voting rights amendment to the states for ratification
this amendment would have granted the district representation in the house senate and electoral college as if it were a state
the proposed amendment had a seven year limit for ratification and only sixteen states ratified it in this period
the city s local government particularly during the mayoralty of marion barry was criticized for mismanagement and waste
barry defeated incumbent mayor walter washington in the democratic party primary
barry was then elected mayor serving three successive four year terms
during his administration in the washington monthly magazine claimed that the district had the worst city government in america
after being imprisoned for six months on misdemeanor drug charges in barry did not run for reelection
in sharon pratt kelly became the first black woman to lead a major u s
barry was elected again in and by the next year the city had become nearly insolvent

however fenty lost a democratic party primary to former council chair vincent gray in august
mayor gray won the general election and assumed office in january with a pledge to bring economic opportunities to more of the city s residents and under served areas
the washington area was a main target of the september attacks
american airlines flight was hijacked by five islamist terrorists and flew into the pentagon in arlington county just across the potomac river from washington killing people inside the building as well as onboard the airliner including the five terrorists
united airlines flight which was also hijacked and which went down in an open field near shanksville pennsylvania supposedly intended to target either the white house or the united states capitol building
since september several high profile incidents and security scares have occurred in washington
in october anthrax attacks involving anthrax contaminated mail sent to numerous members of congress infected staff members and killed two u s
postal service employees who handled the contaminated mail at the brentwood sorting facility
an fbi and doj investigation determined the likely culprit of the anthrax attacks to be bruce edwards ivins a scientist but he committed suicide in july before formal charges were filed
during three weeks of october fear spread among residents of the washington area during the beltway sniper attacks
ten apparently random victims were killed with three others wounded before john allen muhammad and lee boyd malvo were arrested on october
in and a serial arsonist set over fires mainly in the district and the close in maryland suburbs with one fire killing an older woman
a local man was arrested in the serial arson case in april and pleaded guilty
the toxin ricin was found in the mailroom of the white house in november and in the mailroom of u s
senate majority leader bill frist in february
after the september attacks security was increased in washington
screening devices for biological agents metal detectors and vehicle barriers became more commonplace at office buildings as well as government buildings
after the madrid train bombings local authorities decided to test explosives detectors on the vulnerable washington metro subway system
