in nonstandard analysis a branch of mathematics overspill referred to as overflow by goldblatt p is a widely used proof technique
it is based on the fact that the set of standard natural numbers n is not an internal subset of the internal set n of hypernatural numbers
by applying the induction principle for the standard integers n and the transfer principle we get the principle of internal induction
for any internal subset a of n if
is an element of a and
for every element n of a n also belongs to a then
a nif n were an internal set then instantiating the internal induction principle with n it would follow n n which is known not to be the case
the overspill principle has a number of useful consequences
the set of standard hyperreals is not internal
the set of bounded hyperreals is not internal
the set of infinitesimal hyperreals is not internal in particular
if an internal set contains all infinitesimal non negative hyperreals it contains a positive non infinitesimal or appreciable hyperreal
if an internal set contains n it contains an unlimited infinite element of n these facts can be used to prove the equivalence of the following two conditions for an internal hyperreal valued function defined on r
displaystyle forall epsilon in mathbb r exists delta in mathbb r h leq delta implies f x h f x leq varepsilon
displaystyle forall h cong f x h f x cong
the proof that the second fact implies the first uses overspill since given a non infinitesimal positive
positive
displaystyle forall mbox positive delta cong h leq delta implies f x h f x varepsilon
applying overspill we obtain a positive appreciable with the requisite properties
these equivalent conditions express the property known in nonstandard analysis as s continuity or microcontinuity of at x
s continuity is referred to as an external property
the first definition is external because it involves quantification over standard values only
the second definition is external because it involves the external relation of being infinitesimal
