which wrote that the film has the same type of suspenseful action as the original and that Lee Montgomery plays his part to perfection Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film ⁄ stars out of and stated Ben succeeds as a horror show because it contains the requisite number of rat attacks with the camera holding on victims covered with perhaps two dozen clinging scratching and biting rodents
Eeeech But Ben goes beyond mere thrills into the realm of solid drama because of the superb performance of Lee Harcourt Montgomery as Danny Garrison who befriends Ben the leader of the rat pack terrorizing the city Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film is equally scary and diverting as Willard while being more serious and ambitious
However Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film ⁄ stars out of writing This isn't a thriller but a geek movie
In a thriller we're supposed to be scared by some awesome menace to mankind—the Green Blob maybe or Big Foot or the Invincible Squid and his implacable enemy red wine sauce
But in a geek movie the whole idea is to be disgusted because the actors have rats all over them Vincent Canby of The New York Times said The way in which you will respond to Ben will depend on a number of variables including how you feel about the possibility of Los Angeles shutting down trick photography dreadful acting by a dreadful cast the decline and fall of Phil Karlson The Phenix City Story as a director and a screenplay that never has the courage to acknowledge its comic impulses Gary Arnold of The Washington Post thought that the film is not much of an improvement on Willard and has no standout horror sequences Leonard Maltin's film guide also gave the film a negative review awarding it ⁄ out of stars and panning the film's gory visuals
