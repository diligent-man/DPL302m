frankincense also known as olibanum is an aromatic resin used in incense and perfumes obtained from trees of the genus boswellia in the family burseraceae
the word is from old french franc encens high quality incense
there are several species of boswellia that produce true frankincense boswellia sacra syn
bhaw dajiana syn
carteri b
frereana b
serrata b
thurifera indian frankincense and b
papyrifera
resin from each is available in various grades which depend on the time of harvesting
the resin is hand sorted for quality
the english word frankincense derives from the old french expression franc encens meaning high quality incense
the word franc in old french meant noble pure
although named frankincense the name is not referring to the franks
the name of frankincense in koine greek the language of the new testament l banos or liban t s is cognate with the name of lebanon greek the same can be said with regard to arabic phoenician hebrew and vulgar latin l b nus

medieval latin olibanum derived from or libanus
the leading o may have come from latin oleum lit oil or from the greek article o or arabic article al
other names include arabic al lub n persian kondoor syriac bisma hebrew levo na somali foox or somali lubaan classical latin t s
the trees start producing resin at about eight to years old
tapping is done two to three times a year with the final taps producing the best tears due to their higher aromatic terpene sesquiterpene and diterpene content
generally speaking the more opaque resins are the best quality
cheap resin is produced in the horn of africa which is the roman catholic church s major source
the main species in trade are
boswellia sacra south arabia
boswellia bhaw dajiana older spelling boswellia bhau dajiana horn of africa
it is a synonym of boswellia sacra

boswellia serrata synonym boswellia thurifera indian frankincense india
boswellia papyrifera ethiopia eritrea sudan
boswellia frereana horn of africa
resin is less bitter than and fragrance of incense is less heavy than boswellia sacra
contains no boswellic acids other notable species
boswellia occulta horn of africa
in it was discovered that somali harvesters considered boswellia occulta to be the same species with boswellia carteri even though their shapes are different and sold resins from both species as the same thing
however the chemical compositions of their essential oils are completely different recent studies indicate that frankincense tree populations are declining partly due to over exploitation
heavily tapped trees produce seeds that germinate at only while seeds of trees that had not been tapped germinate at more than
in addition burning grazing and attacks by the longhorn beetle have reduced the tree population
conversion clearing of frankincense woodlands to agriculture is also a major threat
these are some of the chemical compounds present in frankincense

frankincense trees are not covered by the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora but experts argue that boswellia species meet the criteria for protection
in a study an ecologist at wageningen university research claimed that by the late s boswellia papyrifera trees in eritrea were becoming hard to find
in a new paper predicted a reduction in boswellia papyrifera within the next two decades
this species found mainly in ethiopia eritrea and sudan accounts for about two thirds of global frankincense production
the paper warns that all boswellia species are threatened by habitat loss and overexploitation
most boswellia grow in harsh arid regions beset by poverty and conflict
harvesting and selling the tree s resin is one of the only sources of income for the inhabitants resulting in overtapping
