Serfs' Emancipation Day observed annually on March is a holiday in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China that celebrates the emancipation of serfs in Tibet The holiday was adopted by the Tibetan legislature on January and was promulgated that same year In modern Tibetan history March was the day that the Tibetan government was declared illegal by China which effectively marked an end to serfdom and the abolition of the hierarchic social system characterized by theocracy with the Dalai Lama as the core of the leadership
The holiday was announced to mark the th anniversary of the beginning of democratic reform of the Tibetan feudal theocratic social structure on March where according to China one million people were freed from serfdom The People's Republic of China had been established since and has had control over Tibet since Mao Zedong had entered into negotiations with the th Dalai Lama to initiate land reform but was told in that any reforms would have to be approved by the Tibetan nobility Mao was surprised by the Tibetan uprising which Chinese historians call an attempt by feudal lords to continue the system forever but the Dalai Lama calls a national uprising In retrospect the Dalai Lama also prefers the term poor people for Tibetans for which he says the designation serf is questionable He also alleges that the Government of Tibet had drawn up plans to gradually lower hereditary debts but that the central government was hesitant preferring to do things their own way
On March in what China Daily called the simultaneous end of serfdom and the abolition of the hierarchic social system characterized by theocracy Zhou Enlai issued a State Council Order declaring the dissolution of the government of Tibet The order also directed the People's Liberation Army to suppress the uprising confiscate the possessions of the rebels and give them to the serfs which by China's estimate comprised of the population in Tibet Reportedly serfs were burning their feudal contracts and dancing in the streets Anna Louise Strong marks July as the precise date when feudal debts were abolished by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region Warren W Smith concurs and further suggests that the government has chosen March instead as counter propaganda to the Tibetan unrest
In presenting it to the Tibetan legislature Pang Boyong Deputy Secretary General of the Tibetan Regional Congress Standing Committee said the bill is aimed at reminding all the Chinese people including Tibetans of the landmark 'democratic reform' initiated years ago since then millions of slaves under the feudal serfdom became masters of their own On January at the second annual session of the ninth regional People's Congress in legislators voted unanimously for the bill designating March annually as Serfs' Emancipation Day
