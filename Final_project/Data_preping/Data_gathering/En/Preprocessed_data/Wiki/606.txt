The Cleveland Browns were a charter member club of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) when the league was founded in 1946
From 1946 to 1949, the Browns won each of the league’s four championships
While the National Football League (NFL) does not recognize the Browns’ AAFC championships, the Pro Football Hall of Fame does recognize the team’s championships, which is reflected in this list
When the AAFC folded in 1949, the Browns were absorbed into the NFL in 1950
The Browns went on to win three NFL championships, nearly dominating the NFL in the 1950s, and won one more NFL championship in 1964
The team has yet to appear in a Super Bowl, however
Overall, the team has won eight championships: four in the AAFC, and four in the NFL.
In 1995, then-Browns owner Art Modell made the decision to move the team from Cleveland, Ohio to Baltimore, Maryland
An agreement between the city of Cleveland and the NFL kept the team’s history, name and colors in Cleveland, while Modell’s new team would be regarded as an expansion team
The Baltimore Ravens would begin play in 1996, and the Browns would return to the league in 1999
For record-keeping purposes, the Browns are considered to have suspended operations from 1996 to 1998, which is reflected in this list
In 2017, the Cleveland Browns became the second team in NFL history (2008 Detroit Lions) to suffer a 0-16 record
In 2020, the Browns won their first playoff game since their reactivation in 1999, defeating the division champion Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card Round.
