the fallacy of exclusive premises is a syllogistic fallacy committed in a categorical syllogism that is invalid because both of its premises are negative
example of an eoo type invalid syllogism
e proposition no cats are dogs
o proposition some dogs are not pets
o proposition therefore some pets are not cats explanation of example
this may seem like a logical conclusion as it appears to be logically derived that if some dogs are not pets then surely some are pets otherwise the premise would have stated no dogs are pets and if some pets are dogs then not all pets can be cats thus some pets are not cats
but if this assumption is applied to the final statement then we have drawn the conclusion some pets are cats
but this is not supported by either premise
cats not being dogs and the state of dogs as either pets or not has nothing to do with whether cats are pets
two negative premises cannot give a logical foundation for a conclusion as they will invariably be independent statements that cannot be directly related thus the name exclusive premises
it is made more clear when the subjects in the argument are more clearly unrelated such as the following additional example of an eoo invalid syllogism
e proposition no planets are dogs
o proposition some dogs are not pets
o proposition therefore some pets are not planets explanation of example
in this example we can more clearly see that the physical difference between a dog and a planet isn t causally linked to the domestication of dogs
the two premises are exclusive and the subsequent conclusion is nonsense as the transpose would imply that some pets are planets conclusion
the verisimilitude of the final statement is not relevant in this fallacy
the conclusions in both examples are uncontroversial however both are argued on fallacious logic and would not hold up as valid arguments affirmative conclusion from a negative premise in which a syllogism is invalid because the conclusion is affirmative yet one of the premises is negative
negative conclusion from affirmative premises in which a syllogism is invalid because the conclusion is negative yet the premises are affirmativesyllogistic fallacies exclusive premises
