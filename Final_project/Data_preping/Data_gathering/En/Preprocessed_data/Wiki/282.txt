oliver cromwell is a devout puritan a country squire magistrate and former member of parliament
king charles i s policies including the enclosing of common land for the use of wealthy landowners and the introduction of romish rituals into the church of england have become increasingly grating to many including cromwell
in fact charles regards himself as a devout anglican though permitting his french queen to practise roman catholicism in private and forbidding her to bring up the young prince of wales in that faith
cromwell plans to take his family to the new world but on the eve of their departure he is persuaded to stay and resume a role in politics
charles has unenthusiastically summoned parliament for the first time in twelve years as he needs money to fight wars against both the scots and the irish
although to appease the commons he agrees to execute his belligerent adviser the earl of strafford parliament will still not grant his requests unless he agrees to reforms that could lead to a constitutional monarchy
committed to belief in the divine right of kings and under pressure from his queen to stand firm charles refuses
when he enters the parliamentary chamber with an armed guard and attempts to arrest five members of parliament of which in reality cromwell was not one war breaks out in england with those who side with parliament arming against the king s supporters both parties convinced that god is on their side
when the parliamentary forces in which cromwell is a cavalry officer prove ineffective at the battle of edgehill he along with sir thomas fairfax sets up the new model army that eventually turns the tide against the king s forces
the army s discipline and training secure victory at the battle of naseby against superior numbers and cromwell s cavalry proves to be the deciding factor though one of his sons is killed in battle
the king is eventually encircled in his headquarters at oxford and has his fervent supporter and cousin prince rupert of the rhine banished after he fails to hold the port of bristol
he is finally defeated in a second conflict after attempting to negotiate for help from catholic nations with the help of the queen and his eldest son who are sent abroad for this purpose
cromwell later hears from sir edward hyde the king s once loyal adviser of charles secret plans to raise a wholly catholic army to support him obstinately refusing to give in to the demands of cromwell and his associates for a system of government in which parliament will have as much say in the running of the country as the king
cromwell therefore uses parliament to have charles tried for treason
at the resulting trial which takes place in the parliament building the king refuses to recognise any authority higher than his own but is found guilty and sentenced to death
after a farewell to his younger children he faces execution bravely and even his most ardent critics are moved by his dignity and the fact that he has forgiven his captors
there is little celebration or satisfaction over his death even on cromwell s part
in fact cromwell has retired moodily to his estate and reacts with anger to a request from his radical colleague henry ireton to become king himself
however parliament soon proves self serving in governing the country until like the late king cromwell is forced to undertake a coup d etat
but where charles failed cromwell succeeds his troops remove the mps from the house of commons leaving cromwell sitting symbolically alone in the chamber as virtual dictator where he outlines to the viewer his vision for the protectorate
the film ends with a voice over stating that cromwell served very successfully for five years as lord protector before charles i s son returned as king of an england never to be the same again

robin stewart as charles prince of walesin hughes read john buchan s biography oliver cromwell and more books before touring england and researching from historic sites to museums and archives
in september warwick purchased the screen rights to buchan s book and hughes was announced as writer and director
during the next few years it was reported peter finch and tony hancock were under consideration for the title role before richard harris was finally cast in
hughes originally wrote the script in
richard harris liked it and wanted to star but financiers did not consider him a big enough star at the time to finance the film
they wanted charlton heston but hughes did not think he was appropriate
heston wrote in his diaries on november that he turned down warwick s cromwell script
in april irving allen announced that john briley had rewritten ken hughes script and that peter hall was going to direct
allen hoped to get paul scofield to play charles i and albert finney to play cromwell
columbia were going to finance with filming to take place the following year
hughes had tried to get richard burton to read the script but burton was not interested
hughes later said he almost succeeded in making the film in but finance fell through at the last minute
in february it was announced hughes would write and direct for irving allen
in april it was reported ronald harwood was working on the script with ken hughes
hughes eventually succeeded in raising the money from columbia in the us
after had been spent they were tempted to pull out but changed their mind
the budget started at million and grew to million
most of the film was shot in england and london s parliament square was constructed at shepperton studios but the battle scenes were shot in spain
the original cut went for three hours fifteen minutes but hughes cut it down to two hours twenty four minutes
i think it s the best thing i ve ever done said hughes in
although publicity for the film boasted that it had been made after ten years of research the film has been criticised for its historical inaccuracies
in its defence george macdonald fraser has written inevitably there are historical queries all the way through as there are bound to be in a picture which takes its subject seriously and tries to cover so much in less than two and a half hours
the main thrust of cromwell is true it gets a great deal of history and the sense of history right
costumes locations e g
the layout of the house of commons and the appearance of actors were generally accurate but as in many historical films as much as for practical film making purposes as anything else liberties were taken with the course of events
the film was generally received unfavourably with criticism of the historical inaccuracies however the performances of its two leads production values and score were praised
filmink said the film does have some good things about it alec guinness is superb as charles i and the production design is amazing
but it s dull
so dull
every time richard harris walks on screen he looks as though he s about to give a speech and he does
the film was one of the most popular movies in at the british box office
