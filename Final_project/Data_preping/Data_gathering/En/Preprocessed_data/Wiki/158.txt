Gaetano Filangieri August July was an Italian jurist and philosopher
Filangieri was born in San Sebastiano al Vesuvio in the province of Naples Italy in the noble family of Filangieri His father Caesar prince of Arianiello intended him to pursue a military career which he commenced at the early age of seven but soon abandoned for the study of the law At the bar his knowledge and eloquence secured his success His defence of a royal decree reforming abuses in the administration of justice gained him the favor of the king Ferdinand IV of Naples and his prime minister Bernardo Tanucci and led to several honorable appointments at court
The first two books of his great work La Scienza della legislazione appeared in The first book contained an exposition of the rules on which legislation in general ought to proceed while the second was devoted to economic questions These two books showed him an ardent reformer and vehement in denouncing the abuses of his time He insisted on unlimited free trade and the abolition of the medieval institutions which impeded production and national well being Its success was great and immediate not only in Italy but throughout Europe at large
In he married resigned his appointments at court and retiring to Cava devoted himself steadily to the completion of his work In the same year appeared the third book relating entirely to the principles of criminal jurisprudence The suggestion which he made in it as to the need for reform in the Roman Catholic church brought upon him the censure of the ecclesiastical authorities and it was condemned by the congregation of the Index in In he published three additional volumes making the fourth book of the projected work and dealing with education and morals
In he was appointed a member of the supreme treasury council by Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies but his health impaired by close study and over work in his new office compelled his withdrawal to the country at Vico Equense He died somewhat suddenly of tuberculosis on July having just completed the first part of the fifth book of his Scienza He left an outline of the remainder of the work which was to have been completed in six books
