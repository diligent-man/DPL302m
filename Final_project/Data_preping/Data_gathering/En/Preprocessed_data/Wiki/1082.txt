Visigothic script was a type of medieval script that originated in the Visigothic kingdom in Hispania the Iberian Peninsula modern Spain and Portugal
Its more limiting alternative designations littera toletana and littera mozarabica associate it with scriptoria specifically in Toledo and with Mozarabic culture more generally respectively
The script which exists in book-hand and cursive versions was used from approximately the late seventh century until the thirteenth century mostly in Visigothic Iberia but also somewhat in southern France
It was perfected in the thth centuries and declined afterwards
It developed from uncial script and shares many features of uncial especially an uncial form of the letter ⟨g⟩
Other features of the script include an open-top ⟨a⟩ very similar to the letter ⟨u⟩ similar shapes for the letters ⟨r⟩ and ⟨s⟩ and a long letter ⟨i⟩ resembling the modern letter ⟨l⟩
There are two forms of the letter ⟨d⟩ one with a straight vertical ascender and another with an ascender slanting towards the left
The top stroke of the letter ⟨t⟩ by itself has a hook curving to the left ⟨t⟩ also has a number of other forms when used in ligatures and there are two different ligatures for the two sounds of ⟨ti⟩ hard or unassibilated and soft or sibilated as spoken in Hispano-Latin during this period
The letters ⟨e⟩ and ⟨r⟩ also have many different forms when written in ligature
Of particular interest is the special Visigothic z ⟨ꝣ⟩ which after adoption into Carolingian handwriting eventually transformed into the c-cedilla ⟨⟩
From the standard script a capital-letter display script was developed with long slender forms
There was also a cursive form that was used for charters and non-religious writings which had northern Leonese and southern Mozarabic forms
The Leonese cursive was used in the Christian north and the Mozarabic was used by Christians living in the Muslim south
The cursive forms were probably influenced by Roman cursive brought to Iberia from North Africa
Visigothic script has many similarities with Beneventan script and Merovingian script
