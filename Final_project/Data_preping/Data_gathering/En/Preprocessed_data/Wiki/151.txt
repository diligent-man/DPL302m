pepin the short king of the franks presented urbino to the papacy in
its commune later had some independence until around when it came into the possession of the house of montefeltro
these noblemen had no direct authority over the commune however they could pressure it to elect them to the position of podest
bonconte di montefeltro obtained this title in urbino s population rebelled and formed an alliance with the independent commune of rimini finally regaining independence in
eventually though the montefeltro noblemen took control once more and held it until
in the struggles between the guelphs and ghibellines when factions supported either the papacy or the holy roman empire respectively the th and th century montefeltro lords of urbino were leaders of the ghibellines of the marche and in the romagna region
the most famous member of the montefeltro family federico da montefeltro ruled as duke of urbino from to
he was a very successful condottiere a skillful diplomat and an enthusiastic patron of art and literature
he rose to power in as the son of guidantonio after a conspiracy and the murder of the legitimate heir oddantonio hated for his unbridled lust and excessive taxes
federico began a reorganization of the state which also included a restructuring of the city according to a modern conception comfortable efficient and beautiful
at his court piero della francesca wrote on the science of perspective francesco di giorgio martini wrote his trattato di architettura treatise on architecture and raphael s father giovanni santi wrote his poetical account of the chief artists of his time
federico s brilliant court according to the descriptions in baldassare castiglione s il cortegiano the book of the courtier published in set standards of what would characterize a modern european gentleman for centuries to come
cesare borgia dispossessed guidobaldo da montefeltro duke of urbino and elisabetta gonzaga in with the complicity of his father pope alexander vi
after the attempt of pope leo x to appoint a young medici as duke thwarted by the early death of lorenzo ii de medici in urbino was part of the papal states under the dynasty of the dukes della rovere
they moved the court to the city of pesaro in and urbino began a slow decline that would continue until the last decades of the seventeenth century
in pope urban viii definitively incorporated the duchy into the papal dominions the gift of the last della rovere duke in retirement after the assassination of his heir to be governed by the archbishop
the state was ruled thereafter by a papal legate generally belonging to high ecclesiastical hierarchy
following the annexation of the duchy by the papal states the rich artistic heritage including furniture of the ducal palace went to form for the most part the dowry of the last direct descendant of the della rovere vittoria della rovere who married ferdinand ii de medici
these works went on to form the core of the future uffizi gallery
among the works that went to florence is the diptych of the dukes of urbino by piero della francesca
other works of the ducal palace were brought to rome such as the barberini ex tables of fra carnevale and the famous library absorbed entirely by the vatican library in
the eighteenth century opened with the election to the papacy of cardinal giovan francesco albani urbino under the name of clement xi
this was a windfall for the city and was its last great era especially in terms of arts and culture thanks to funding by pope albani and his family
major renovation of several buildings churches and monasteries took place such as palazzo albani part of the fa ade of the town hall the archbishop s palace the chapel albani inside the convent of st
francis saint joseph s oratory and the internal structure of the churches of san francesco san domenico and saint augustine
in addition due to the patronage of the pope and of his family the duomo di urbino received many improvements like the new altar as did other religious institutions in the city
from july to november urbino hosted the court of james stuart the exiled pretender to the british throne who had the strong backing of the papacy
this new age of splendor for the city ended with the death of clement xi in placing the city in a long decline that has continued to the present day
after the pope s death the albani family remained the main patron of the most significant works until the first half of the nineteenth century
in the collapse of the cathedral dome following a massive earthquake led to the total renovation of the church
between and the city was occupied by french troops like much of northern and central italy
during the french occupation urbino and its territory suffered from the acquisitions of important works of art by the french which were moved to paris or milan in the nascent galleries of the louvre and brera
this event was a further cause of the impoverished local artistic heritage already tried by the loss of the works following the devolution of the duchy in the seventeenth century
the century opened with the consecration in of the new duomo di urbino as designed by the architect giuseppe valadier who restored the city s montefeltro era buildings such as the old seminary adjacent to the church of st
sergius now partly occupied by the hotel raffaello
following the construction of the new palace of alban designed by architect peter ghinelli which gave rise to the present piazza della repubblica that went on to form the first part of the future corso garibaldi the city experienced a number of urban improvements designed to change the face of the city
from the construction of the sanzio theater came the final realization of corso garibaldi with a covered walkway on the downhill side to that ensure theater goers were sheltered from rain and snow on their walk to the piazza della repubblica with construction that lasted until the early part of the twentieth century
in addition another important change was the destruction in of a part of the walls to create a customs barrier called porta nuova or barrier margherita in honor of princess margaret of savoy which was necessitated by a new road that ran along a stretch of the walls and was connected to corso garibaldi
this resulted in a new urban layout with the large spit of land below the doge s palace incorporated into the city called the pincio
these urban transformations brought about a change in access to the city
instead of passing through narrow winding streets through the gates of the walls now one could enter through the porta nuova in an easier and convenient way to arrive in the present piazza della repubblica and the palazzo ducale the city center
this urban renewal reflected many of the ideas of fulvio corboli but its design was largely done by the architect vincenzo ghinelli
on september the piedmontese troops entered urbino from port saint lucia forcing the surrender of the last resistance of the papal army under the portico of the childhood house of raphael
but it was not until september with the capture of ancona that the total conquest of the marche region was completed by the piedmont army
between and november the plebiscite was held for the annexation of the marche to the kingdom of sardinia which ended with votes in favor votes against and invalid ballots
in the province of urbino excluding the territory of pesaro the count was for and against with invalid ballots
subsequently on november the marche was included in the statuto albertino and then on december it was made official with the issuance of a royal decree
the new government began the confiscation of various ecclesiastical goods including good part of the convent of san francisco where a part of a botanical garden designed by vincenzo ghinelli was located the monastery of santa chiara that of san girolamo and many others
the century began as had the previous one
this period of quiet lasted for almost the entire first half of the twentieth century with no particular significant events
in this period the scuola del libro istituto per la decorazione e l illustrazione del libro was founded and expressed considerable talent both nationally and internationally
in addition to the artistic development from the scuola del libro urbino also began to grow as a university town with the elevation to university faculty of nineteenth century school of pharmacy and the birth of the department of education approximately
due to these changes in the university an increase in the student population led to housing shortages that highlighted the state of total unpreparedness of the city so much that for the first time many students were housed in the homes of private citizens
the problem was partly solved with the establishment of the male boarding school raphael at the beginning of the century and the female boarding school laura battiferri in approximately
this period was dominated by great events of national and international history which inevitably were expressed in urbino
the period of the fascist dictatorship left its mark on the city especially from an architectural point of view with a fascist elementary school giovanni pascoli built on the ancient garden of saint lucia part of the duke s private gardens the restoration of the palace mauruzi gherardi then the seat of the court as well as the student house to compensate for the shortage of accommodation as a result of the large increase in university population and housing for the maimed and disabled civilians
in the city was designated as the headquarters for the fledgling soprintendenza alle gallerie e alle opere d arte delle marche roughly translated as the organization of galleries and works of art of the marche
with the outbreak of world war ii the city suffered no bombing thanks to the large red cross painted on the roof of the ducal palace and an agreement between the germans and the allies
only towards the end of the war did the retreating german troops try to destroy all the ramparts of the walls but luckily the mines were tampered with by the workers the germans had hired from urbino
during the retreat the german army isolated the city with the destruction of rail and road links
in addition the germans planned to blow up a tunnel then under construction between urbino and the parish of schieti that was being used by the nazis to store weapons
because of its location at the foot of the historic center the population feared that an explosion would lead to the destruction of the village above but this did not happen
during the second world war the then superintendent of the galleries and works of art in urbino in the marche pasquale rotondi secretly placed around priceless works including those of giorgione piero della francesca paolo uccello titian mantegna raphael and many more from all the major museums in italy that were being stolen by the nazis into the rock of sassocorvaro
his actions gained worldwide recognition and to this day the rock of sassocorvaro is known as the ark of art
urbino was liberated from the nazi occupation on august thanks to the british v corps polish troops and the heroic actions of partisan groups in the area

immediately after that the genoese architect was commissioned by the city to prepare the general plan aimed at the recovery of the historical center which had been in poor condition and was in danger of losing several neighborhoods including the palazzo ducale to the land subsidence below
this problem was solved thanks to state funding derived from two special laws enacted for the city in and in
subsequently de carlo realized several projects for the university including the college s dormitories near the capuchin church outside the city center an interesting example of how architecture can merge with the surrounding landscape
he also completed projects like the construction of the department of magisterium the restructuring of the department of law and the battiferri building for the department of economics
they are three significant examples of the inclusion of a contemporary architecture in an ancient surrounding and are still studied today
the seventies were marked by a collaboration with the municipality for a project called operation mercatale which included the construction of a multi story underground car park under torricini s famous ducal palace and the restoration of the helical ramp under the theater by francesco di giorgio martini in collaboration with the city
they also developed the project of renovation of the sanzio theater and the renovation project much discussed of the ancient ducal stables
in addition thanks to the close relationship with de carlo the city has hosted twice and the laboratories of the ilaud founded and directed by the genoese architect
one of the last of de carlo actions was the preparation between and of the new general plan
the clay earth of urbino which still supports industrial brickworks supplied a cluster of earthenware manufactories botteghe making the tin glazed pottery known as maiolica
simple local wares were being made in the th century at urbino but after the della rovere dukes francesco maria i della rovere and his successor guidobaldo ii encouraged the industry which exported wares throughout italy first in a manner called istoriato using engravings after mannerist painters then in a style of light arabesques and grottesche after the manner of raphael s stanze at the vatican
other centers of th century wares in the duchy of urbino were at gubbio and castel durante
the great name in urbino majolica was that of nicolo pillipario s son guido fontana
