particulate inheritance pattern inheritance discovered mendelian genetics theorist william bateson ronald fisher gregor mendel showing phenotypic trait passed generation generation discrete particle known gene keep ability expressed always appearing descending generation
early century scientist already recognized earth ha inhabited living creature long time
also understand physical trait inherited one generation next
blending inheritance wa common ideal time wa later discredited experiment gregor mendel
mendel proposed theory particulate inheritance using pea plant pisum sativum explain variation inherited maintained time
modern term allele would blend together form completely new allele
variation maintained timesince mendel used experimental method devise particulate inheritance theory developed three basic law inheritance law segregation law independent assortment law dominance
mendel's experiment tall short pea plant demonstrates individual plant ha two particle called alleles
pea plant produce gamete reproductive cell segregate one allele one
law state parent differ two pair contrasting character inheritance one pair character independent pair characters
pea plant mendel observed allele dominant masked effect allele recessive
term dominant recessive used masking covered allele respectively
also tall allele tall mask allele short term phenotype
publication titled supposition mendelian inheritance among close relative ra
fisher showed particulate inheritance wa capable generating vast amount variation see among closely related individuals
helped reconcile biometric mendelian school thought time wa important step modern synthesis
