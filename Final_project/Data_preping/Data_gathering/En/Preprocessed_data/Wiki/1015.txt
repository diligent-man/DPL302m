he was elected first secretary in march at the age of
less than two years after the liberation of the country the monarchy of king zog was formally abolished and hoxha rose to power as albania s symbolic head of state
during his year rule he rebuilt the country which was left in ruins after world war ii building albania s first railway line raising the adult literacy rate from to more than wiping out epidemics electrifying the country and leading albania towards agricultural independence
he also outlawed religion travelling abroad and private proprietorship closed or converted to secular uses all of albania s religious facilities
under his regime thousands of perceived dissidents were executed and tens of thousands more were imprisoned in forced labour camps
hoxha s government was characterised by his proclaimed firm adherence to anti revisionist marxism leninism i e
stalinism from the mid late s onwards
after his break with maoism in the period numerous maoist parties around the world declared themselves hoxhaist
the international conference of marxist leninist parties and organisations unity struggle is the best known association of these parties
hoxha was born in gjirokast r in southern albania then a part of the ottoman empire the son of halil hoxha a muslim tosk cloth merchant who travelled widely across europe and the us and gjylihan gjylo hoxha n e u i
his surname hoxha in turkish hoca pronounced hodja means master or a teacher and is the most common one in albania
it is derived from the noun khawaja which when used specifically in the albanian language refers to a muslim priest given that some of his paternal ancestors have likely been the members of the muslim clergy ulema
he was named by his father after the renowned ottoman military officer and member of the young turks enver pasha
the hoxha family originated from the village of dropull and was attached to the bektashi order
in his father brought him to seek the blessing of baba selim of the zall teqe
after elementary school he followed his studies in the city senior high school liria
he started his studies at the gjirokast r lyceum in
after the lyceum was closed due to intervention of ekrem libohova hoxha was awarded a state scholarship for the continuation of his studies in kor at the french language albanian national lyceum until
in hoxha went to study at the university of montpellier in france on a state scholarship for the faculty of natural science but lost an albanian state scholarship for neglecting his studies
he later went to paris where he presented himself to anti zogist immigrants as the brother in law of bahri omari
from to he was employed as a secretary at the albanian consulate in brussels
after returning to albania he worked as a contract teacher in the gymnasium of tirana
hoxha taught french and morals in the kor a liceum from to and also served as the caretaker of the school library
on april albania was invaded by fascist italy
the italians established a puppet government the albanian kingdom under shefqet v rlaci
at the end of he was transferred to the gjirokastra gymnasium but he soon returned to tirana
he was helped by his best friend esat dishnica who introduced hoxha to dishnica s cousin ibrahim bi ak iu
hoxha started to sleep in bi ak iu s tobacco factory flora and after a while dishnica opened a shop with the same name where hoxha began working
he was a sympathiser of kor a s communist group
on november the communist party of albania later renamed the party of labour of albania in was founded
hoxha was chosen from the kor a group as a muslim representative by the two yugoslav envoys as one of the seven members of the provisional central committee
the first consultative meeting of activists of the communist party of albania was held in tirana from to april with hoxha himself delivering the main report on april
in july hoxha wrote call to the albanian peasantry issued in the name of the communist party of albania
the call sought to enlist support in albania for the war against the fascists
the peasants were encouraged to hoard their grain and refuse to pay taxes or livestock levies brought by the government
after the september conference at pez the national liberation movement was founded with the purpose of uniting the anti fascist albanians regardless of ideology or class
by march the first national conference of the communist party elected hoxha formally as first secretary
during wwii the soviet union s role in albania was negligible
on july the albanian partisans were organised in regular units of companies battalions and brigades and named the albanian national liberation army
the organization received military support from the british intelligence service soe
the general headquarters was created with spiro moisiu as the commander and hoxha as political commissar
the yugoslav partisans had a much more practical role helping to plan attacks and exchanging supplies but communication between them and the albanians was limited and letters often arrived late sometimes well after a plan had been agreed upon by the national liberation army without consultation from the yugoslav partisans
within albania repeated attempts were made during the war to remedy the communications difficulties which faced partisan groups
in august a secret meeting the mukje conference was held between the anti communist balli komb tar national front and the communist party of albania
the result of this was an agreement to
unite in a single struggle against the fascist invader
cease all attacks between the two parties signing the agreement
form a joint operational staff to coordinate military actions within albania
recognise that the democratically elected national liberations councils are the state power in albania
recognise that the goal for the post war era is an independent democratic albania where the people themselves will decide the form of government
recognise and respect the atlantic charter the london and washington treaties between the ussr great britain and the us in connection with the question of kosovo and am ria
be it resolved that the populations of kosovo and cam ria will themselves decide their future in accordance with their wishes
unite with any political group whatever their beliefs in a common military effort against the fascist invaders
however the communist party of albania will not collaborate with any group of the national front that continues to maintain contacts with the fascist invaders
the communist party of albania will unite with any group that used to have contacts with the fascist invaders but has now terminated those contacts and is willing to now fight against the fascist invaders provided those groups have not committed any crimes against the people to encourage the balli komb tar to sign the greater albania sections that included kosovo part of yugoslavia and cham ria were made part of the agreement
a problem developed when the yugoslav communists disagreed with the goal of establishing a greater albania and asked the communists in albania to withdraw their agreement
according to hoxha josip broz tito did not believe that kosovo was albanian and serbian opposition to the transfer made it an unwise option
after the albanian communists repudiated the greater albania agreement the balli komb tar condemned the communists who in turn accused the balli komb tar of siding with the italians
the balli komb tar however lacked support from the people
after judging the communists as an immediate threat the balli komb tar sided with nazi germany fatally damaging its image among those fighting the fascists
the communists quickly added to their ranks many of those disillusioned with the balli komb tar and took centre stage in the fight for liberation
the permet national congress held during that time called for a new democratic albania for the people
although the monarchy was not formally abolished zog i of albania was barred from returning to the country which further increased the communists control
the anti fascist committee for national liberation was founded chaired by hoxha
on october the committee became the democratic government of albania after a meeting in berat and hoxha was chosen as interim prime minister
tribunals were set up to try alleged war criminals who were designated enemies of the people and were presided over by ko i xoxe
after liberation on november several albanian partisan divisions crossed the border into german occupied yugoslavia where they fought alongside tito s partisans and the soviet red army in a joint campaign which succeeded in driving out the last pockets of german resistance
marshal tito during a yugoslavian conference in later years thanked hoxha for the assistance that the albanian partisans had given during the war for national liberation lufta nacional lirimtare
the democratic front dominated by the albanian communist party succeeded the national liberation front in august and the first post war election was held on december that year
the front was the only legal political organisation allowed to stand in the elections and the government reported that of albanians voted for it
on january zog was officially deposed and albania was proclaimed the people s republic of albania renamed the people s socialist republic of albania in
as first secretary of the party hoxha was de facto head of state and the most powerful man in the country
albanians celebrate their independence day on november which is the date on which they declared their independence from the ottoman empire in while in the former people s socialist republic of albania the national day was november the day the country was liberated from the italians
both days are currently national holidays
hoxha declared himself a marxist leninist and strongly admired soviet leader joseph stalin
during the period of the government adopted policies and actions intended to consolidate power which included extrajudicial killings and executions that targeted and eliminated anti communists
the agrarian reform law was passed in august
it confiscated land from beys and large landowners giving it without compensation to peasants
of all land was owned by large landowners before the law was passed this declined to after the law s passage
illiteracy which was in rural areas in fell to by and by it was equal to that of a western country
by the us and british intelligence organisations were working with the former king zog and the mountain men of his personal guard
they recruited albanian refugees and migr s from egypt italy and greece trained them in cyprus malta and the federal republic of germany west germany and infiltrated them into albania
guerrilla units entered albania in and but they were killed or captured by albanian security forces
kim philby a soviet double agent working as a liaison officer between mi and the cia had leaked details of the infiltration plan to moscow and the security breach claimed the lives of about infiltrators
on february a bombing occurred at the soviet embassy in tirana after which accused intellectuals were arrested and put in prison
one of them jonuz kaceli was killed by prime minister mehmet shehu during interrogation
subsequently the others were executed without trial under hoxha s orders
they were later found to be innocent
the state university of tirana was established in which was the first of its kind in albania
the medieval gjakmarrja blood feud was banned
malaria the most widespread disease was successfully fought through advances in health care the use of ddt and through the draining of swampland
from to no cases of malaria were reported whereas previously albania had the greatest number of infected patients in europe
no cases of syphilis had been recorded for years
in the number of physicians was per and there was only one hospital bed per people
in while the number of physicians had not increased there were four times as many hospital beds per head and health expenditures had risen to of the budget up from before the war
at this point relations with yugoslavia had begun to change
the roots of the change began on october at the second plenary session of the communist party of albania
the session considered the problems that the post independence albanian government would face
however the yugoslav delegation which was led by velimir stoini accused the party of sectarianism and opportunism and blamed hoxha for these errors
he also stressed the view that the yugoslav communist partisans spearheaded the albanian partisan movement
anti yugoslav members of the albanian communist party had begun to think that this was a plot by tito who intended to destabilize the party
ko i xoxe sejfulla mal shova and others who supported yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion
tito s position on albania was that it was too weak to stand on its own and that it would do better as a part of yugoslavia
hoxha alleged that tito had made it his goal to get albania into yugoslavia firstly by creating the treaty of friendship co operation and mutual aid in
in time albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards yugoslav interests much like the italian agreements with albania under zog that made the nation dependent upon italy
the first issue was that the albanian lek became revalued in terms of the yugoslav dinar as a customs union was formed and albania s economic plan was decided more by yugoslavia
albanian economists h
banja and v
to i stated that the relationship between albania and yugoslavia during this period was exploitative and that it constituted attempts by yugoslavia to make the albanian economy an appendage to the yugoslav economy
hoxha then began to accuse yugoslavia of misconduct
stalin advised hoxha that yugoslavia was attempting to annex albania we did not know that the yugoslavs under the pretext of defending your country against an attack from the greek fascists wanted to bring units of their army into the pra people s republic of albania
they tried to do this in a very secretive manner
in reality their aim in this direction was utterly hostile for they intended to overturn the situation in albania by june the central committee of yugoslavia began publicly condemning hoxha accusing him of taking an individualistic and anti marxist line
when albania responded by making agreements with the soviet union to purchase a supply of agricultural machinery yugoslavia said that albania could not enter into any agreements with other countries without yugoslav approval
ko i xoxe tried to stop hoxha from improving relations with bulgaria reasoning that albania would be more stable with one trading partner rather than with many
nako spiru an anti yugoslav member of the party condemned xoxe and vice versa
with no one coming to spiru s defense he viewed the situation as hopeless and feared that yugoslav domination of his nation was imminent which caused him to commit suicide in november
at the eighth plenum of the central committee of the party which lasted from february to march xoxe was implicated in a plot to isolate hoxha and consolidate his own power
he accused hoxha of being responsible for the decline in relations with yugoslavia and stated that a soviet military mission should be expelled in favor of a yugoslav counterpart
hoxha managed to remain firm and his support had not declined
when yugoslavia publicly broke with the soviet union hoxha s support base grew stronger
then on july tirana called on all yugoslav technical advisors to leave the country and unilaterally declared all treaties and agreements between the two countries null and void
xoxe was expelled from the party and on june he was executed by hanging
after the break with yugoslavia hoxha aligned himself with the soviet union
from to million in soviet aid was given to albania for technical and infrastructural expansion
albania was admitted to the comecon on february and served as a pro soviet force on the adriatic
a soviet submarine base was built on the albanian island of sazan near vlor posing a hypotethical threat to the u s
sixth fleet in the mediterranean
relations with the soviet union remained close until the death of stalin in march
it was followed by days of national mourning in albania more than in the soviet union
hoxha assembled the population of tirana in the capital s largest square featuring a stalin statue requested that they kneel take a word oath of eternal fidelity and gratitude to their beloved father and great liberator
under nikita khrushchev stalin s eventual successor aid was reduced and albania was encouraged to adopt khrushchev s specialisation policy
under it albania would develop its agricultural output in order to supply the soviet union and other warsaw pact countries while they would be developing products of their own which would in theory strengthen the warsaw pact
however this also meant that albanian industrial development which was stressed heavily by hoxha would be hindered
in may june nikolai bulganin and anastas mikoyan visited yugoslavia while khrushchev renounced the expulsion of yugoslavia from the communist bloc
khrushchev also began making references to palmiro togliatti s polycentrism theory
hoxha had not been consulted on this and was offended
yugoslavia began asking for hoxha to rehabilitate the image of ko i xoxe which hoxha steadfastly rejected
in at the twentieth party congress of the communist party of the soviet union khrushchev condemned the cult of personality that had been built up around joseph stalin and denounced his excesses
khrushchev then announced the theory of peaceful coexistence which angered the stalinist hoxha greatly
the institute of marxist leninist studies led by hoxha s wife nexhmije quoted vladimir lenin the fundamental principle of the foreign policy of a socialist country and of a communist party is proletarian internationalism not peaceful coexistence hoxha now took a more active stand against perceived revisionism
unity within the albanian party of labour began to decline as well with a special delegate meeting held in tirana in april composed of delegates and having unexpected results
the delegates criticized the conditions in the party the negative attitude toward the masses the absence of party and socialist democracy the economic policy of the leadership etc while also calling for discussions on the cult of personality and the twentieth party congress
in hoxha called for a resolution which would confirm the existing leadership of the party
the resolution was accepted and all of the delegates who had spoken against it were expelled from the party and imprisoned
hoxha claimed that yugoslavia had attempted to overthrow the leadership of albania
this incident increased hoxha s power effectively making khrushchev style reforms impossible there
in the same year hoxha travelled to the people s republic of china then embroiled in the sino soviet split and met mao zedong
chinese aid to albania rose sharply in the next two years
in an effort to keep albania in the soviet sphere increased soviet aid was given but relations with the soviet union remained at the same level until when khrushchev met sofoklis venizelos a liberal greek politician
khrushchev sympathised with the concept of an autonomous greek north epirus and he hoped to use greek claims to keep the albanian leadership in line
hoxha reacted by only sending hysni kapo a member of the albanian political bureau to the third congress of the romanian workers party in bucharest an event communist heads of state were normally expected to attend
as relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate in the course of the meeting khrushchev said
relations with the soviet union declined rapidly
a hardline policy was adopted and the soviets reduced grain shipments at a time when albania needed them due to the possibility of a flood induced famine
in july a plot to overthrow the albanian government was discovered
it was to be organised by soviet trained rear admiral teme sejko
after this two pro soviet members of the party liri belishova and ko o tashko were expelled
in august the party s central committee sent a protest to the central committee of the cpsu about having an anti albanian soviet ambassador in tirana
the fourth congress of the party held from to february was the last meeting that the soviet union or other eastern european nations attended in albania
during the congress mehmet shehu stated that while many members of the party were accused of tyranny this was a baseless charge and unlike the soviet union albania was led by genuine marxists
the soviet union retaliated by threatening dire consequences if the condemnations were not retracted
days later khrushchev and anton n novotn president of czechoslovakia threatened to cut off economic aid
in march albania was not invited to attend the meeting of the warsaw pact nations and in april all soviet technicians were withdrawn from albania
in may nearly all soviet troops at the soviet submarine base were withdrawn
on november hoxha made a speech in which he called khrushchev a revisionist an anti marxist and a defeatist
hoxha portrayed stalin as the last communist leader of the soviet union and alluded to albania s independence
by november the ussr and every other warsaw pact nation broke diplomatic relations with albania
albania was unofficially excluded from the warsaw pact and comecon
the soviet union also attempted to claim control of the submarine base
the albanian party then passed a law prohibiting any other nation from owning an albanian port
the soviet albanian split was now complete
as hoxha s leadership continued he took on an increasingly theoretical stance
he wrote criticisms which were based on theory and current events which occurred at the time his most notable criticisms were his condemnations of maoism after
a major achievement under hoxha was the advancement of women s rights
albania had been one of the most if not the most patriarchal countries in europe
the ancient code of lek which regulated the status of women states a woman is known as a sack made to endure as long as she lives in her husband s house women were not allowed to inherit anything from their parents and discrimination was even made in the case of the murder of a pregnant woman
women were forbidden from obtaining a divorce and the wife s parents were obliged to return a runaway daughter to her husband or else suffer shame which could even result in a generations long blood feud
during world war ii the albanian communists encouraged women to join the partisans and following the war women were encouraged to take up menial jobs as the education necessary for higher level work was out of most women s reach
in worked in various sectors of the economy
in this number had risen to and in to
during the cultural and ideological revolution discussed below women were encouraged to take up all jobs including government posts which resulted in of the people s councils and of the people s assembly being made up of women including two women in the central committee by
in times as many females attended eight year schools as had done so in and times as many females attended secondary schools
by times as many women attended higher schools as in
hoxha said of women s rights in the entire party and country should hurl into the fire and break the neck of anyone who dared trample underfoot the sacred edict of the party on the defense of women s rights in direct taxation was abolished and during this period the quality of schooling and health care continued to improve
an electrification campaign was begun in and the entire nation was expected to have electricity by
instead it achieved this on october making it the first nation with complete electrification in the world
during the cultural ideological revolution of the military changed from traditional communist army tactics and began to adhere to the maoist strategy known as people s war which included the abolition of military ranks which were not fully restored until
mehmet shehu said of the country s health service in
hoxha s legacy also included a complex of one man concrete bunkers across a country of million inhabitants to act as look outs and gun emplacements along with chemical weapons
the bunkers were built strong and mobile with the intention that they could be easily placed by a crane or a helicopter in a hole
the types of bunkers vary from machine gun pillboxes beach bunkers to underground naval facilities and even air force mountain and underground bunkers
hoxha s internal policies were true to stalin s paradigm which he admired and the personality cult which was developed in the s and organised around him by the party also bore a striking resemblance to that of stalin
at times it even reached an intensity which was as extreme as the personality cult of kim il sung which hoxha condemned with hoxha being portrayed as a genius commenting on virtually all facets of life from culture to economics to military matters
each schoolbook required one or more quotations from him on the subjects being studied
the party honored him with titles such as supreme comrade sole force and great teacher
he adopted a different type military salute for the people s army to render honors which was known as the hoxhaist salute which involves soldiers curling their right fist and raising it to shoulder level
it replaced the zogist salute which was used by the royal albanian army for many years
hoxha s governance was also distinguished by his encouragement of a high birthrate policy
for instance a woman who bore an above average number of children would be given the government award of heroine mother in albanian n n heroin along with cash rewards
abortion was essentially restricted to encourage high birth rates except if the birth posed a danger to the mother s life though it was not completely banned the process was decided by district medical commissions
as a result the population of albania tripled from million in to around million in
at the start of albania s third five year plan china offered albania a loan of million which would be used to build twenty five chemical electrical and metallurgical plants in accordance with the plan
however the nation discovered that the task of completing these building projects was difficult because albania s relations with its neighbors were poor and because matters were complicated by the long distance between albania and china
unlike yugoslavia or the ussr china had less economic influence on albania during hoxha s rule
during the previous fifteen years at least of albania s economy was dependent on foreign commerce
by the time the constitution was promulgated albania had mostly become self sufficient but it lacked modern technology
ideologically hoxha found that mao s initial views were in line with marxism leninism due to his condemnation of nikita khrushchev s alleged revisionism and his condemnation of yugoslavia
the financial aid which was provided by china was interest free and it did not have to be repaid until albania could afford to do so
china never intervened in albania s economic output and chinese technicians worked for the same wages as albanian workers
albanian newspapers were reprinted in chinese newspapers and they were also read on chinese radio and albania led the movement to give the people s republic of china a seat on the un security council
during this period albania became the second largest producer of chromium in the world which was considered important to the country
strategically the adriatic sea was attractive to china as it was hoped that more allies could be gained in eastern europe through albania which failed
zhou enlai visited albania in january
on january the sino albanian joint statement was signed in tirana
the statement said of relations between socialist countries
like albania china defended the purity of marxism by attacking us imperialism and soviet and yugoslav revisionism both of them were equally attacked as part of a dual adversary theory
yugoslavia was viewed as both a special detachment of u s
imperialism and a saboteur against world revolution
however these views began to change in china which was one of the major issues which albania had with the alliance
additionally unlike yugoslavia and the soviet union the sino albanian alliance lacked an organisational structure for regular consultations and policy coordination and it was also characterized by an informal relationship which was conducted on an ad hoc basis mao made a speech on november in which he claimed that albania was the only marxist leninist state in europe and in the same speech he also stated that an attack on albania will have to reckon with the great people s republic of china
if the u s
imperialists the modern soviet revisionists or any of their lackeys dare to touch albania in the slightest nothing lies ahead for them but a complete shameful and memorable defeat likewise hoxha stated that you may rest assured comrades that come what may in the world at large our two parties and our two peoples will certainly remain together
they will fight together and they will win together
during the cultural revolution china entered into a four year period of relative diplomatic isolation however its relations with albania were positive
on august the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia was condemned by albania along with the brezhnev doctrine
albania refused to send troops to czechoslovakia in support of the invasion and it officially withdrew from the warsaw pact on september
albania s relations with china began to deteriorate on july when united states president richard nixon agreed to visit china in order to meet with zhou enlai
hoxha believed that china had betrayed albania and on august the central committee of the pla sent a letter to the central committee of the ccp in which it called nixon a frenzied anti communist
the letter stated
the result of this criticism was a message from the chinese leadership in in which it stated that albania could not depend on an indefinite flow of aid from china and in albania was advised to curb its expectations about further chinese contributions to its economic development
by hoxha wrote in his diary reflections on china that china was no longer a socialist country
and in he wrote that the chinese leaders
in response trade with comecon although trade with the soviet union was still blocked and yugoslavia grew
trade with third world nations was million in but million in
trade rose from to
following mao s death on september hoxha remained optimistic about sino albanian relations but in august hua guofeng the new leader of china stated that mao s three worlds theory would become official foreign policy
hoxha viewed this as a way for china to justify having the u s
as the secondary enemy while viewing the soviet union as the main one thus allowing china to trade with the u s
he stated that
from august to september tito visited beijing and was welcomed by the chinese leadership
following this the pla declared that china was now a revisionist state akin to the soviet union and yugoslavia and that albania was the only marxist leninist state on earth
hoxha stated
on july china announced that it was cutting off all of its aid to albania
for the first time in modern history albania did not have an ally and it also did not have a major trading partner
certain clauses in the constitution circumscribed the exercise of political liberties which the government interpreted as being contrary to the established order
the government denied the population access to information other than that which was disseminated by government controlled media outlets
internally the sigurimi used the same repressive methods which were used by the nkvd the mgb kgb and the east german stasi
at one point every third albanian had either been interrogated by the sigurimi or been incarcerated in labour camps
the government imprisoned thousands of people in forced labour camps or it executed them for alleged crimes such as treachery or disrupting the proletarian dictatorship
after travel abroad was forbidden to all but those people who were on official business
western european culture was looked upon with deep suspicion resulting in bans on all unauthorised foreign materials and arrests
art was required to reflect the styles of socialist realism
beards were banned as unhygienic in order to curb the influence of islam many imams and babas had beards and the eastern orthodox faith
the justice system s legal proceedings regularly degenerated into show trials
an american human rights group described the proceedings of one trial in order to lessen the threat of political dissidents and other exiles relatives of the accused were often arrested ostracised and accused of being enemies of the people
political executions were common and at least people possibly as many as were killed by the regime
torture was often used to obtain confessions during hoxha s rule there were six institutions for political prisoners and fourteen labour camps where political prisoners and common criminals worked together
it has been estimated that there were approximately people imprisoned in albania in
article of the albanian criminal code stated that to escape outside the state as well as refusal to return to the fatherland by a person who has been sent to serve or has been permitted temporarily to go outside the state was an act of treason a crime punishable by a minimum sentence of ten years and a maximum sentence of death
the albanian government went to great lengths to prevent people from defecting by leaving the country an electrically wired metal fence stands meters to one kilometer from the actual border
anyone touching the fence not only risks electrocution but also sets off alarm bells and lights which alert guards stationed at approximately one kilometre intervals along the fence
two meters of soil on either side of the fence are cleared in order to check for footprints of escapees and infiltrators
the area between the fence and the actual border is seeded with booby traps such as coils of wire noise makers consisting of thin pieces of metal strips on top of two wooden slats with stones in a tin container which rattle if stepped on and flares that are triggered by contact thus illuminating would be escapees during the night albania the only predominantly muslim country in europe at that time largely owing to turkish influence in the region had not like the ottoman empire identified religion with ethnicity
in the ottoman empire muslims were classified as turks orthodox christians were classified as greeks and catholics were classified as latins
hoxha believed that this division of albanian society along religious and ethnic lines was a serious issue because it fueled greek separatists in southern albania in particular and it also divided the nation in general
the agrarian reform law of confiscated much of the church s property in the country
catholics were the earliest religious community to be targeted because the vatican was seen as being an agent of fascism and anti communism
in the jesuit order was banned and the franciscans were banned in
decree no
on religion sought the establishment of a national church and it also forbade religious leaders from associating with foreign powers
mother teresa a catholic nun whose relatives resided in albania during hoxha s rule was denied a chance to see them because she was considered a dangerous agent of the vatican
despite multiple requests and the fact that many countries made requests on her behalf she was not granted the opportunity to see her mother and sister
both mother teresa s mother and sister died during hoxha s rule and the nun herself was only able to visit albania five years after the communist regime collapsed
dom lush gjergji in his book our mother teresa describes one of her trips to the embassy where she was crying as she was leaving the building saying dear god i can understand and accept that i should suffer but it is so hard to understand and accept why my mother has to suffer
in her old age she has no other wish than to see us one last time
the party focused on atheist education in schools
this tactic was effective primarily as a result of the high birthrate policy which was encouraged after the war
during periods which are considered holy periods by religious people such as lent and ramadan many foods and non water beverages were distributed in schools and factories and religious people who refused to eat those foods and drink those beverages when they were offered to them during their fasting times were denounced
starting on february the party began to promote secularism in place of abrahamic religions
hoxha who had launched a cultural and ideological revolution after being partially inspired by china s cultural revolution encouraged communist students and workers to use more forceful tactics in order to discourage people from continuing their religious practices but the use of violence was initially condemned
according to hoxha the surge in anti theist activities began with the youth
the result of this spontaneous unprovoked movement was the demolition or conversion of all churches and mosques in albania
state atheism became official policy and albania was declared the world s first atheist state
town and city names which echoed abrahamic religious themes were abandoned for neutral secular ones as well as personal names
by hoxha stated in a speech in that religion is a fuel kindling fires of all evils
during this period religiously based names were also made illegal
the dictionary of people s names published in contained approved secular names
in monsignor dias the papal nuncio for albania appointed by pope john paul ii said that of the three hundred catholic priests present in albania prior to the communists coming to power only thirty were still active
the promotion of religion was banned and all clerics were labeled reactionaries and outlawed
those religious figures who refused to embrace the principles of marxism leninism were either arrested or carried on their activities in hiding
during the anti religious campaign enver hoxha declared that the only religion of albania is albanianism a quotation from the poem o moj shqiperi o albania by the th century albanian writer pashko vasa
muzafer korkuti one of the dominant figures in post war albanian archaeology and now the director of the institute of archaeology in tirana said this in an interview on july
efforts were focused on an illyrian albanian continuity issue
an illyrian origin of the albanians without denying pelasgian roots continued to play a significant role in albanian nationalism resulting in a revival of given names supposedly of illyrian origin at the expense of given names associated with christianity
at first albanian nationalist writers opted for the pelasgians as the forefathers of the albanians but as this form of nationalism flourished in albania under enver hoxha the pelasgians became a secondary element to the illyrian theory of albanian origins which could claim some support in scholarship
the illyrian descent theory soon became one of the pillars of albanian nationalism especially because it could provide some evidence of continuity of an albanian presence both in kosovo and southern albania i e
areas that were subject to ethnic conflicts between albanians serbs and greeks
