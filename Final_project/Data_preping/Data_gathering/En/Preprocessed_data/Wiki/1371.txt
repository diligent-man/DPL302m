Serapis Koinē Greek Σέραπις later form or Sarapis Σάραπις earlier form originally Demotic wsjr ḥp Osiris Apis or Sorapis Koinē Greek Σόραπις is a Graeco Egyptian deity The cult of Serapis was pushed forward during the third century BC on the orders of Greek Pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt as a means to unify the Greeks and Egyptians in his realm A serapeum Koinē Greek Σεραπεῖον serapeion was any temple or religious precinct devoted to Serapis The cultus of Serapis was spread as a matter of deliberate policy by the Ptolemaic kings Serapis continued to increase in popularity during the Roman Empire often replacing Osiris as the consort of Isis in temples outside Egypt
Serapis was depicted as Greek in appearance but with Egyptian trappings and combined iconography from a great many cults signifying both abundance and resurrection Though Ptolemy I may have created the official cult of Serapis and endorsed him as a patron of the Ptolemaic dynasty and Alexandria Serapis was a syncretistic deity derived from the worship of the Egyptian Osiris and Apis and also gained attributes from other deities such as chthonic powers linked to the Greek Hades and Demeter and benevolence linked to Dionysus
There is evidence that the cult of Serapis existed before the Ptolemies came to power in Alexandria a temple of Serapis in Egypt is mentioned in BC by both Plutarch Life of Alexander and Arrian Anabasis VII The common assertion that Ptolemy created the deity is derived from sources which describe him erecting a statue of Serapis in Alexandria this statue enriched the texture of the Serapis conception by portraying him in both Egyptian and Greek style
In a Christian mob led by Pope Theophilus of Alexandria destroyed the Serapeum of Alexandria but the cult survived until all forms of pagan religion were suppressed under Theodosius I in
The name of the deity is derived from the syncretic worship of Osiris and the bull Apis as a single deity under the Egyptian name wsjr ḥp This name was later written in Coptic as ⲟⲩⲥⲉⲣϩⲁⲡⲓ Userhapi Sarapis was the most common form in Ancient Greek until Roman times when Serapis became common
The most renowned serapeum was in Alexandria Under Ptolemy I Soter efforts were made to integrate Egyptian religion with that of their Hellenic rulers Ptolemy's policy was to find a deity that should win the reverence alike of both groups despite the curses of the Egyptian priests against the gods of the other previous foreign rulers eg Set who was lauded by the Hyksos Alexander the Great had attempted to use Amun for this purpose but he was more prominent in Upper Egypt and not as popular in Lower Egypt where the Greeks had stronger influence
The Greeks had little respect for animal headed figures and so a Greek style anthropomorphic statue was chosen as the idol and proclaimed as the equivalent of the highly popular Apis It was named Userhapi ie Osiris Apis which became Greek Sarapis and was said to be Osiris in full rather than just his ka life force
The earliest mention of a Sarapis occurs in the disputed death scene of Alexander BC Here Sarapis has a temple at Babylon and is of such importance that he alone is named as being consulted on behalf of the dying king The presence of Sarapis in Babylon would radically alter perceptions of the mythologies of this era the unconnected Babylonian god Ea Enki was titled Šar Apsi meaning king of the Apsu or the watery deep and perhaps he is the one meant in the diaries His significance in the Hellenic psyche due to its involvement in Alexander's death may have also contributed to the choice of Osiris Apis as the chief Ptolemaic god
According to Plutarch Ptolemy stole the cult statue from Sinope in Asia Minor having been instructed in a dream by the unknown god to bring the statue to Alexandria where the statue was pronounced to be Sarapis by two religious experts One of the experts was of the Eumolpidae the ancient family from whose members the hierophant of the Eleusinian Mysteries had been chosen since before history and the other was the scholarly Egyptian priest Manetho which gave weight to the judgement both for the Egyptians and the Greeks
Plutarch may not be correct however as some Egyptologists allege that the Sinope in the tale is really the hill of Sinopeion a name given to the site of the already existing Serapeum at Memphis Also according to Tacitus Serapis ie Apis explicitly identified as Osiris in full had been the god of the village of Rhakotis before it expanded into the great capital of Alexandria
The statue suitably depicted a figure resembling Hades or Pluto both being kings of the Greek underworld and was shown enthroned with the modius a basketgrain measure on his head since it was a Greek symbol for the land of the dead He also held a sceptre in his hand indicating his rulership with Cerberus gatekeeper of the underworld resting at his feet The statue also had what appeared to be a serpent at its base fitting the Egyptian symbol of rulership the uraeus
With his ie Osiris's wife Isis and their son Horus in the form of Harpocrates Serapis won an important place in the Greek world In his nd century AD Description of Greece Pausanias notes two Serapeia on the slopes of Acrocorinth above the rebuilt Roman city of Corinth and one at Copae in Boeotia
Serapis figured among the international deities whose cult was received and disseminated throughout the Roman Empire with Anubis sometimes identified with Cerberus At Rome Serapis was worshiped in the Iseum Campense the sanctuary of Isis built during the Second Triumvirate in the Campus Martius The Roman cults of Isis and Serapis gained in popularity late in the st century when Vespasian experienced events he attributed to their miraculous agency while he was in Alexandria where he stayed before returning to Rome as emperor in From the Flavian Dynasty on Serapis was one of the deities who might appear on imperial coinage with the reigning emperor
The main cult at Alexandria survived until the late th century when a Christian mob destroyed the Serapeum of Alexandria in The Theodosian decree of implicitly included the cult in its general proscription of religions other than approved forms of Nicene Christianity
Serapis is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud as Sar Apis an idol thought to have been named after the biblical Joseph
Serapis is the main antagonist of the Rick Riordan short story The Staff of Serapis which crosses over two of his major series The Kane Chronicles and Camp Half Blood Chronicles He is destroyed by Annabeth Chase and Sadie Kane after the former destroys the head representing the future on Serapis' staff In the follow up story The Crown of Ptolemy it's revealed that Serapis was awakened by the overall main antagonist Setne in order to test bringing Greek demigods and Egyptian magicians togetherSerapis Bey the Ascended Master in charge of the Ascension Temple
