She lowered the world record on all three occasions she raced Challenge Roth formerly Quelle Challenge Roth at Roth in Bavaria Germany Her current record of hours minutes seconds is more than minutes faster than the record which stood from to when Yvonne van Vlerken broke it by just over minutes Following her world record her former coach Brett Sutton described Wellington as a person of true international sporting excellence that is overshadowed by no one in any other sport
Paula Newby Fraser's course record at the Ironman World Championships had stood for years until Wellington broke it in At the time of her retirement Wellington held the four fastest times ever recorded by a woman over the ironman distance and had the greatest number of sub hour times nine five more than Newby Fraser's previous record In addition to the Ironman titles she was also the International Triathlon Union ITU Age Group World Champion and the ITU long distance World Champion
Before becoming a professional triathlete Wellington worked for the British government as an adviser on international development and for Rural Reconstruction Nepal on development projects in Nepal International development remains one of her passions She is actively involved in supporting charities relating to international development and supporting and encouraging women and girls to take up sport

Christine Wellington was born in Bury St Edmunds Suffolk and grew up in Feltwell a small village in Norfolk She was a competitive swimmer as a teenager when she swam for Thetford Dolphins and went on to swim for her university She describes herself as a sporty kid swimming playing hockey running but never excelling and always more interested in the social side of the sports scene She was educated at her local comprehensive school Downham Market High School and Sixth Form where she was a member of most school sports teams but focused more on my studies than I did on reaching my full potential on the pitch
After graduating with first class honours in geography from Birmingham University in Wellington travelled the world for two years which she described as opening her eyes to the many problems that exist in the world but also to the opportunity for positive change In supported by a £ scholarship from the Economic and Social Research Council she enrolled in an MA course in development studies at the University of Manchester Graduating with a Distinction in October she joined the UK government agency DEFRA in London to work on international development policy At DEFRA she was part of the team that negotiated for the UK at the World Summit on Sustainable Development and became involved in following up the UK government's commitments on water and sanitation She also worked on post conflict environmental reconstruction policy
Disillusioned with bureaucracy and paper pushing in September Wellington took sabbatical leave from DEFRA to work in Nepal for Rural Reconstruction Nepal RRN a Nepalese development NGO Based in the capital Kathmandu she managed a community led total sanitation scheme in Salyan a conflict affected district in the west of the country She also performed many other tasks for RRN including preparing project proposals editing books and writing papers
On leaving Nepal at the end of she travelled to New Zealand Tasmania and Argentina before returning to her old job at DEFRA in May She left this job in February in order to become a professional triathlete
Wellington's first triathlon race was at the Eton Super Sprints on May where she finished third In the following two months she won this race on both occasions In July and August she sampled two longer Olympic distance triathlons the Milton Keynes Triathlon and the Bedford Triathlon finishing fourth and third respectively In August she won the mixed team British triathlon sprint distance relay championship in Nottingham
She had to put her triathlon racing on hold for her sabbatical in Nepal where she was based in Kathmandu at an altitude of m ft Every morning before work she would cycle around the neighbouring countryside on her mountain bike with a group of foreign and Nepali cyclists known as the Mongolian Cycling Team She would also go running along the many hilly trails in the Kathmandu valley When riding around the outlying villages on her mountain bike she would often have to wait for male co workers to catch up with her During a religious holiday she spent two weeks cycling with friends some km from Lhasa the capital of Tibet to Kathmandu crossing mountain passes over m enduring sandstorms and blizzards and reaching Base Camp on the northern Tibetan side of Mount Everest at m ft Her coach Brett Sutton believes this experience to have been very useful altitude training for her later professional career while Wellington herself regards it as having given her lasting mental strength
Her friends in Nepal remarked on how she never missed a morning bike ride whether or not she was sick Chrissie saying 'Oh I have a stomach bug' was like saying hello every day but no matter how many bugs were inside her tummy she would always train and push herself every second said one friend adding We all wondered how fast she would be if she had no bugs and that thought was scary
In February she entered the Coast to Coast a km two day endurance race across the Southern Alps of New Zealand involving running cycling and kayaking She finished nd in this race despite having no previous kayaking experience apart from some brief training before the race
Shortly after her return to the UK she won the Shropshire Olympic Triathlon This qualified her to enter the ITU World Age Group Amateur Championships in Lausanne Switzerland a title which she won on September beating her nearest rival by minutes and seconds She later said she trained really hard for this race for weeks juggling hours a week of training with my full time job
During this period like most amateur triathletes she had also continued entering running races She had previously run the London Marathon for charity in finishing in making her the fastest woman from her running club in that race That result prompted her to get a running coach Frank Horwill whom she regarded as legendary and ever inspiring and to take her running training much more seriously She had hoped to improve her marathon time in the April London Marathon but in March she collided with a car while riding her commuter bike in Clapham The accident resulted in a haematoma in her left thigh causing in an example of myositis ossificans a cm spur of bone to grow from her femur Unable to run the marathon she took up swimming again leading her to try triathlon racing in After her ITU victory she took up cross country racing for the first time as a means of building strength for her triathlon races She enjoyed some success in B and C grade cross country events around London winning several races including the South of Thames Championship in December
After winning the world amateur title Wellington began to consider taking the risk of giving up her job in order to become a professional triathlete In January on the recommendation of a friend she travelled to Switzerland to ask the opinion of the Australian triathlon coach Brett Sutton Within days she had handed in her notice at DEFRA and in February flew out to Thailand to join Sutton's teamTBB at their base in Phuket
She turned professional with the intention of racing standard distance events and enjoyed early success winning Olympic distance events in Bangkok and Subic Bay then returned to the UK where she won the sprint distance event at Bleinheim Later the same month she entered her first longer distance event the UK half Ironman race at Wimbleball but suffered mechanical problems with her bicycle forcing her to climb the steep Exmoor hills in too high a gear and finished in th place She returned to winning form only six days later at the shorter Zürich triathlon
On August Wellington took on her toughest challenge to date the long distance Alpe d'Huez Triathlon known for its difficult summer heat its altitude and its hard climbs on both the bike and running stages Despite a puncture and being forced off the road by an oncoming vehicle during a fast descent she finished the bike stage mins sec in front of her nearest rival Sione Jongstra and extended her lead on the running stage to win the race by over minutes in th place overall
Towards the end of July her coach had suggested that she was ready for an Ironman despite the relatively low volume of her training She said of Sutton my training was more geared to standard distance with not much high volume I don't seem to need high volume work like three hour runs I've done none of these since I've been with Brett Some of the other girls will This is why he is so special he has an ability to spot potential even if the athlete can't He said I was ready even on the training I was doing
After days of acclimatisation at her team's base in Thailand Wellington won Ironman Korea in very hot conditions finishing over minutes ahead of nd placed Yasuko Miyazaki in th place overall By winning this race she earned a slot to race at the Ironman world championships in Hawaii
On October October UTC Wellington won the Ironman world championship title at Kailua Kona Hawaii together with US prize money She finished in five minutes ahead of Samantha McGlone running the marathon leg in the second fastest time recorded to date by a woman on the Hawaii course Her victory was described as the biggest upset in Ironman Hawaii history a remarkable feat deemed to be a near impossible task for any athlete racing as a rookie at their first Ironman World Championships and one of the biggest shocks in the sport's history
At the Ironman Australia Triathlon in April her first Ironman since Hawaii Wellington again won by a margin of five minutes finishing th overall Her marathon time of was beaten by only two men Only twenty days later she attempted her first World Cup race the Tongyeong BG Triathlon in Korea but could only finish in nd place She wrote If I judged every day by whether I win or lose yesterday would be considered a 'bad day' But I need to have these days because the 'defeats' expose my weaknesses and enable me to grow learn and develop as an athlete
At the Ironman European Championship race held in Frankfurt Germany on July in perfect weather conditions Wellington recorded the second fastest time to date by a woman over the Ironman distance just seconds outside Paula Newby Fraser's world record of set in the Ironman Europe race which was then held in Roth Spectators were aware throughout the race that Wellington was close to breaking the world record but she did not know exactly what it was and in any case preferred to slow down to celebrate her victory over the last few kilometres exchanging greetings and hi fives with the crowd Her coach said that her plan was to do it as easy as possible once she had got to the front Other factors affecting her time were that she lost some of her nutrition on the bike having to rely on the aid stations instead and that the bike course was km too long
Later that month she retained her title at the long distance Alpe d'Huez Triathlon finishing second overall more than minutes ahead of second placed Aléxandra Louison and only minute seconds behind the winning man Marcus Ornellas She recorded the fastest overall time for the ascent of les virages pictured right
At her previous two attempts on the half Ironman distance Wellington had finished th Wimbleball mechanical difficulties and rd Singapore less than three weeks after her first Ironman On August she achieved her first win at the half Ironman distance at the Timberman triathlon in Gilford New Hampshire placing sixth overall minutes ahead of runner up Amanda Stevens
Two weeks after her Timberman win Wellington met the ironman distance world record holder Yvonne van Vlerken on the latter's home ground at Almere in an eagerly awaited clash for the ITU long distance World Championship title Wellington won with a dominating performance more than minutes in front of Denmark's Charlotte Kolters Van Vlerken finished in third place minutes behind Wellington
In October Wellington returned to Kona as defending champion and retained her title setting a new Hawaii marathon course record of Despite losing around minutes because of a flat tyre a delay which would have been greater if fellow competitor Rebekah Keat had not given her a spare CO cartridge she finished some minutes ahead of second placed Yvonne van Vlerken
On October Wellington announced that together with Hilary Biscay and Belinda Granger she would be leaving teamTBB and their coach Brett Sutton to train under new coach Cliff English She said
I owe so much to Brett and teamTBB It was Brett that advised me to turn pro he told me to do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships Not only that the Team framework enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible and for that I am truly grateful teamTBB is focused on helping development athletes who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon I no longer fit into their framework and hence the time has come for me to move on
Two weeks later Wellington announced that instead of Cliff English fiancé and coach of her rival Samantha McGlone her new coach would be Simon Lessing
Despite suffering from shingles Wellington set a new record for ironman distance triathlon races of on July at the Quelle Challenge Roth beating Yvonne van Vlerken's record set a year earlier over the same course by minutes and seconds Rebekah Keat who finished second minutes seconds behind Wellington also beat van Vlerken's time Wellington's bike split was a new world record Commentator Timothy Carlson wrote Superwoman Chrissie Wellington didn't just break it she obliterated the one year old women's Iron distance world record today

Commenting on Wellington's record Newby Fraser said But the revelation I had was watching how hard she worked for it and it was clear she was going to the well And I am certain she had to leave a little bit of herself out there to get it done She didn't take a moment to enjoy until she crossed the line Part of me was gratified by that I know what she had to do to get it and I hope she realizes it's not that easy I know it wasn't that easy for her A race like that takes a piece of herself out there A year later her coach Dave Scott revealed that she had an upper hamstring injury and that Deep down inside she had a bit of a struggle in Even though she had broken the long standing course record Scott said But I knew and she knew and I told her in my ever candid callous style that she didn't have her best day
On Saturday January during an intended hour training ride in the Surrey Hills with her boyfriend and two other friends Wellington fell from her bicycle when it slipped on black ice She fractured her radius two metacarpals and two fingers in her right arm and hand She required surgery under general anaesthetic to insert wires later removed into her arm and wrist and had to wear a cast on her arm for six weeks
The injury severely limited her training but once the cast was removed she was able to train intensively with her friend Catriona Morrison near Águilas in south east Spain She later acknowledged that the crash had a positive outcome enforcing a mental and physical break and enabling her to focus on other areas of improvement such as her strength and to properly resolve her hamstring problems which had been hampering her running

After this race her former coach Brett Sutton wrote The triathlon world should be rejoicing For the first time in the women's sport and second time in this sport they have a true champion not just a champion of the sport like Erin Baker and Paula Newby Fraser but also a champion on the level of a Kieren Perkins a 'Thorpedo' or a Michael Phelps if we look at swimming If we take a look at running a Haile Gebrselassie a Paula Radcliffe He added You have in Chrissie a person of true international sporting excellence that is overshadowed by no one in any other sport
In August Wellington set a new course record in her third consecutive victory at Timberman but at the last minute on the day of the Ironman World Championship October she decided not to start the race because of illness describing it as the hardest decision of her life to date Subsequent blood tests which also included an anti doping control showed that she had or had had bacterial strep throat bacterial pneumonia and West Nile virus
On November having allowed herself six weeks to recover from her illness Wellington set a new world record for an Ironman branded race over the full Ironman distance in Tempe Arizona of Her time was the third fastest female ironman distance time to date beaten only by her two records in Roth Despite riding the last two miles of the bike course on a flat tyre she beat the previous course record by minutes and runner up Linsey Corbin's time by minutes Her marathon time was only slower than the fastest men's run and her swim time only seconds slower than the men's winner Timo Bracht Commentator Timothy Carlson quoted Wellington's boyfriend as saying It's a sign of a true champion that she can pick herself up after something as painful as her withdrawal at Hawaii Six weeks later all the issues from Hawaii were behind her and today she was phenomenal to which Carlson added Phenomenal might have been an understatement
Having trained in Stellenbosch since mid February Wellington won Ironman South Africa on April in a new M dot world record time of lowering her own record by a little over minutes She finished in th place overall nearly minutes ahead of runner up Rachel Joyce who in turn broke the previous course record by minutes Not only did Wellington set new female bike run and course records but her marathon time of was also faster than all of the men

On a routine training ride near Boulder Wellington suffered a serious bike crash on Saturday September exactly two weeks before the World Championships in Kona She received severe road rash equivalent to second or third degree burns on her left leg and injuries to her left elbow and hip Wellington described the pain as intense much worse than the fractures she had suffered earlier in the year but X rays showed no broken bones Her first attempt at training after the accident was on the following Tuesday when despite a swollen infected leg she tried swimming She could manage no more than two lengths in pain she later described as excruciating She had to be lifted out of the pool and given crutches to enable her to walk her boyfriend Tom Lowe and coach Dave Scott had to carry her back to her car The next day Wednesday she was due to fly to Kona but she preferred to remain in Boulder close to the experts treating her The infection was causing her fever and night sweats and the hip pain had disturbed her running gait
By Saturday the infection had died down and she flew to Kona On Sunday Wellington published a blog post in which she referred to Sun Tzu's book The Art of War and elaborated on how war strategy could be applied to triathlon saying that she hadn't lost her fight because of her injuries and quoting Bella Bayliss's dictum that It's not a race it's war The flight had caused her leg to swell up again but she was still able to do some bike and run training On Monday she tried a four kilometre swim her first hard swim since the crash this produced pain in her pectoral muscle which worsened over subsequent training sessions On Tuesday she tried another swim session after km she had to stop and again had to be lifted out of the pool by Lowe She later wote I was 'crying into my goggles' and described the pain as 'unbearable' adding I was convinced I'd broken my rib Every breath hurt and I couldn't move my arm properly The previous day Mike Leahy had begun treating Wellington using his Active Release Therapy ART he instructed her to go to the hospital for tests not wanting to continue ART treatment if the problem was a fracture The hospital's first concern from the swollen state of her leg was that she might have a pulmonary embolism Six hours of tests showed that she had no fractures nor any embolism but that she did have damaged pectoral and intercostal muscles the badly infected state of her leg was obvious from the appalling smell when the bandages were removed
Welliington's condition improved over the remaining three days before the race thanks in part to a new course of antibiotics and continued ART and acupuncture treatments In public consistent with her mantra of never give your opponents anything Wellington admitted to little more than road rash but journalists at the pre race press conference were correctly able to detect a different less confident attitude in Wellington before the race
Her coach had advised her to hold back on her swim speed otherwise she might not be able to complete the race together with the lack of power in her left arm that meant her swim was much slower than usual at minutes In contrast with her previous races at Kona where Wellington had dominated on the bike she started the marathon stage with five women still in front of her Wellington's main concern though was Mirinda Carfrae the champion who was only a little over three minutes behind her and the only woman who had run faster than her on this course a serious worry given Wellington's injuries
Her hip had been in constant pain during the bike stage but once she started on the marathon her hamstrings began seizing up as well She wrote I saw my family at mile three and gave them a smile but inside the pain was unbearable She described the pain on the marathon as the worst I'd ever known 'You are going to hurt like hell' I said to myself because this is just the start She ran the first half of the marathon in hour minutes her fastest ever at Kona increasing her lead over Carfrae to five minutes Her body slowed down in the intense heat approaching the Energy Lab where she passed Caroline Steffen to gain the lead She crossed the finish line with a marathon time of winning in an overall time of Her marathon time was a course record until Carfrae crossed the line in second place minutes seconds later in turn setting a new marathon course record of Her overall time was second only to the course record she had set in
After the race her coach Dave Scott told journalist T J Murphy that Wellington was traumatised by the effects of her injuries and that despite her stoic attitude her injuries were worse than any of us might have imagined adding I don't think Chrissie will appreciate me telling you this but it's important Murphy described her performance as inspirational but added it was more than that It was chilling It was chilling to watch because you could see Wellington racing her way right to the hospital paying literally no heed to her brain's internal governor one that has been wired into the human body through millions of years of evolution
Leaving open the possibility that she might return to triathlon racing Wellington formally announced on January that she would be taking a one year break from professional Ironman racing in in order to spend more time in the UK with her friends and family and to explore new opportunities which she would otherwise be unable to undertake with the necessary focus and dedication Two exceptional opportunities arising in were promoting her book A Life Without Limits due to be published the following month and the London Olympics She would also be able to devote more time to her charity work to raising the profile of triathlon in the UK and to representing her sponsors Among the charities she hoped to spend more time supporting were Jane's Appeal the Blazeman Foundation for ALS Girls Education Nepal and Challenged Athletes Foundation Having missed the Olympics when she was in Australia she was keen to experience the Olympics in her home country in any capacity whether as a spectator as a volunteer or in the media In August she joined the BBC's television commentary team for both the men's and women's Olympic triathlon events
On December Wellington announced that she had decided to make her retirement from professional triathlon racing permanent She referred to the World Ironman Championships in with the enormous difficulties she overcame on that occasion as her perfect race the race which completed her She would continue to be associated with the sport but not as a professional racer
Chrissie Wellington first discovered Parkrun when she came across people lining up in Richmond Park on a Saturday morning and spontaneously decided to take part In February Chrissie joined Parkrun's staff as Head of Participation She later became its Head of Health and Wellbeing
In June Chrissie completed the Comrades Marathon one of the world's toughest ultra marathons She finished th in the women's age category
Chrissie Wellington has said she has two passions in life sport and development In her victory speech at the Hawaii Ironman she referred to her experience teaching at Beaver Country Day School near Boston where she first noticed the difference that sport can make to children's lives She also noted from her experience in Nepal how sport can bring conflict affected communities together In an interview her coach Brett Sutton said She has kicked around for years through South East Asia working for underprivileged people That's why she was in Nepal Already this year she has done clinics in Thailand and the Philippines and now sponsors a young Filipino athlete to attend our group for the coach to work some magic I think her win could be the catalyst for the sport in South East Asia
To give you an insight into Chrissie Wellington's mind her first talk to me about the media and the frenzy around her was Boss I don't want us to lose sight of what we discussed about my goal I want to be able to use my triathlon result to help develop social programs for underprivileged kids in South East Asia Any sponsor who does not believe this is a priority we can do without If it costs me a little money I am at ease with that This is the real Chrissie the one people don't see behind the flashy smile
Reflecting on her victory three weeks later Wellington wrote
Anyone that knows me has probably been on the receiving end of one of my rants Like a stuck record I ramble on about development to anyone that will pretend to listen It is my passion and has been for a long time Poverty conflict violence crime exclusion and so forth are not givens They happen for a reason We have the power to change things And sport is one vehicle for doing so It has the power to build bridges to empower to teach to heal this is what triathlon and every other sport should be about I hope that I can in a small way help to inspire people to take up sport realise their own dreams and their full potential
