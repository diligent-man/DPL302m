from the bps s inception to ven
nyanaponika thera was the bps s english editor
from until ven
bhikkhu bodhi was the editor
since ven
bhikkhu nyanatusita is the editor
the bps s english language publications fall into three classes two series of booklets called the wheel and bodhi leaves and full size books
the wheel consists of booklets issued in a format x inches typically ranging from to pages
since the inception of bps in about titles have been published though not all have been maintained in print
the booklets cover a wide range of topics and can be categorized as introductory booklets specific teachings on the main topics of buddhist doctrine such as the four noble truths the noble eightfold path dependent origination the three marks of existence kamma and rebirth and so forth meditation and mind training dhamma reflections more personal explorations of the relevance of buddhist principles for spiritual understanding and practice philosophy and psychology faith and devotion monastic life comparative studies buddhist history and culture buddhism and the world today translations from the pali canon non canonical buddhist literature
all wheel publications have been digitalised and are being reissued in bound volumes as well as put on the bps website
bodhi leaves is a series of smaller booklets hand sized between and pages in length
its range of categories is similar to that of the wheel but the tone is less expository and more conversational
bodhi leaves are intended to offer personal insights into the buddha s teachings detailed focus on specific ethical and social problems and practical guidelines to living by the light of the dhamma
this series was discontinued but the issues are being made available in digital format on the bps website
the bps s line of full size books includes both basic introductions and advanced texts on the finer points of buddhist doctrine and practice
books on basic buddhism include several comprehensive surveys that have been regarded as essential reference works
narada thera s the buddha and his teachings is an account of the master s life and teaching highlighting the doctrines of kamma and rebirth meditation the nature of nibb na and the way to enlightenment
for a complete biography bhikkhu anamoli s the life of the buddha is unique a vivid portrait of the enlightened one composed primarily from texts of the pali canon
bhikkhu anamoli s the life of the buddha is the most popular title and though in print for over twenty five years it is still constantly in demand
for an account of the buddha s path two authoritative works can be recommended
one is piyadassi thera s popular the buddha s ancient path the other is bhikkhu bodhi s the noble eightfold path
both works contain detailed explanations of each of the eight factors of the path offering interpretations on how buddhism can be practiced as a way of life
for elementary original source material on the dhamma two compilations by the great german scholar monk nyanatiloka thera ven
nyanaponika s teacher are still unsurpassed
the more elementary is the word of the buddha first compiled in and reprinted sixteen times
this book arranges the buddha s sayings around the framework of the four noble truths
the more advanced title is the buddha s path to deliverance which documents the buddha s own instructions on all the different methods of meditation both for concentration and insight and arranges them according to the pattern of the seven stages of purification
the bps also publishes translations of several small classics from the pali canon including achariya buddharakkhita s the dhammapada and in one volume the ud na and the itivuttaka translated by john ireland
for more advanced students the present writer has issued translations of four major pali suttas along with their commentaries and excerpts from the subcommentaries
the first of these is the best one to start with the discourse on the all embracing net of views a translation of the brahmajala sutta and its commentaries
the others are the discourse on the root of existence the mulapariyaya sutta the great discourse on causation the mahanidana sutta and the discourse on the fruits of recluseship the sama aphala sutta
bps books on meditation give guidance in both the practical methods of meditation and the underlying theory
an informative survey is amadeo sole leris s tranquillity and insight which systematically explores both samatha and vipassan meditation according to the classical sources and their modern adaptations
a modern classic is nyanaponika thera s the heart of buddhist meditation
basic instructions in insight meditation are found in mahasi sayadaw s practical insight meditation while jack kornfield s modern buddhist masters collects tracts from a range of contemporary theravada meditation masters from burma and thailand
a work with a unique flavour is the seven stages of purification by the late matara sri an r ma mahathera one of sri lanka s most respected meditation masters of recent times
the bps also publishes several books on the abhidhamma a systematic arrangement of the buddha s philosophical and psychological teachings defining the theory that lies behind his pragmatically oriented discourses a comprehensive manual of abhidhamma a translation of the abhidhammattha sangaha with an explanatory guide by the burmese sayadaw u rewatadhamma and bhikkhu bodhi
nyanaponika thera s abhidhamma studies demonstrates the practical relevance of the abhidhamma to the spiritual life
to find one s way through the seven books of the canonical abhidhamma nyanatiloka thera s guide through the abhidhamma pitaka is of great use
the visuddhimagga discusses the full range of classical theravada thought achariya buddhaghosa s masterpiece
this is a virtual encyclopedia of buddhist doctrine and meditation which gives detailed coverage to all the meditation subjects and a survey of the abhidhamma
this is published by bps in the outstanding translation by bhikkhu anamoli under the title the path of purification
the bps also publishes the translation of an earlier shorter work the vimuttimagga or path of freedom which served as the example for the visuddhimagga and which is only completely extant in a chinese translation

ehara soma thera and kheminda thera
a new translation of this work is currently being done by bhikkhu nyanatusita
