the nus was formed on february at a meeting held at the university of london
at this meeting the inter varsity association and the international students bureau which organised student travel and had been lobbying for a national body agreed to merge
founding members included the unions of university of birmingham birkbeck university of london london school of economics imperial college who first left in and have subsequently rejoined and left three times the last time being in june king s college london who supplied the first president sir ivison macadam and the university of bristol
in the aftermath of the second world war and with the onset of the cold war the national union of students had adopted a no politics clause in its charter in an attempt to distance itself from its s flirtations with communism
during the s it had thus concerned itself with collective bargaining over student grants teaching salaries and education
this apolitical consensus was challenged in concert with the international protests of and as the cold war intensified
at the nus conference then president trevor fisk came up against jack straw then close to bert ramelson of the communist party of great britain but much later foreign secretary under the new labour government of tony blair over the issue
straw supported student protests against us military involvement in the vietnam war while fisk advocated neutrality straw s side won and the no politics clause was removed
a new era began for the nus where political agitation and protest became institutionalized
straw was followed up as president by digby jacks also representing the radical student alliance formed in by fergus nicholson and a member of the communist party of great britain
according to contemporary british government reports the rsa was connected to the trotskyist led vietnam solidarity campaign and had close links with the sozialistischer deutscher studentenbund organising a protest following rudi dutschke s shooting
the government report stated if they have an ideological bible it consists of the work of professor herbert marcuse one dimensional man in line with the marcusian viewpoint of championing politicised minority groups throughout the s the nus came to support what it called liberation campaigns including homosexual rights the first national group to do so in radical feminism and black nationalism
at the same time the nus adopted a no platform policy a concept pioneered by the img in to stifle the campus organisation and speech of nationalistic british groups that it declared to be racist or fascist
at the time this was aimed at the national front and the monday club a faction in the federation of conservative students
the union was also involved in affairs in northern ireland where most higher education establishments there were members of both the nus and the union of students in ireland though this differed from case to case
indeed two presidents of the nus earlier on in the s were from queen s university belfast t
william savage and t
geoff martin
the unrest in northern ireland saw the onset of the troubles and a sectarian divisiveness come to the fore
after members of the qubsu organised a protest against politician bill craig some members such as bernadette devlin eamonn mccann and michael farrell decided to found the trotskyist group people s democracy in which played a role in the northern ireland civil rights movement
following a meeting in galway in to combat divisions it was agreed that a group called the nus usi would be founded with dual membership to cover northern ireland
one of the nus protest campaigns which was of particular significance during the s and the s was the boycott campaign against national party governed south africa as part of the anti apartheid movement
in nus vice president tony klug visited south africa and met with steve biko of the saso among others
members also attempted to disrupt south african rugby and cricket matches in the united kingdom during the s
in the s the nus played a significant role in getting barclay s bank to divest from south africa attacking it as boerclay bank
throughout this period the nus presidency was dominated by the broad left within which the communist party of great britain where eurocommunism was most popular among students rather than the pro soviet tankie anti revisionists predominated and usually supplied the president but were backed up labour and the liberals
they did so to work as a voting bloc against both the conservatives and militant
the first of these broad left presidents was charles clarke later a home secretary under blair who as a member of the clause four group won the national organisation of labour students back from militant influence
other presidents included sue slipman who began on the eurocommunist wing on the communist party of great britain but ended up a founding member of the social democratic party by trevor phillips a broad left independent and the first black nus president who later led the race relations group the runnymede trust and david aaronovitch who was then a eurocommunist but later a journalist aligned to neoconservatism
from with the election of neil stewart until andrew pakes stood down in the presidency of the national union of students was controlled by the national organisation of labour students which shortened its name to labour students in
the fairtrade nus campaign was started by students at the university of edinburgh in autumn
the campaign which has now been joined by numerous other students unions in britain is calling for of the hot beverages tea coffee hot chocolate etc sold by member unions of the nus to be accredited with the fairtrade markchart
the campaign has since been extended into students organising for sustainability sos uk an educational charity responding to the climate emergency and ecological crisis
the fairtrade foundation collaborated with the nus in awarding the fairtrade universities and colleges award which started as a pilot in
as of twelve universities had achieved fairtrade status
under the leadership of wes streeting the nus abandoned its long standing commitment to free education and backed a graduate tax as its preferred outcome of the browne review into higher education funding
before the general election the nus invited candidates sign a pledge not to raise tuition fees receiving over signatories from prospective parliamentary candidates
this became a very high profile campaign when many liberal democrat mps who all signed individual nus pledges stating they would vote against any rise in tuition fees if elected had to abstain or do the opposite as part of their coalition agreement
the nus under new leader aaron porter organised a national protest attended by thousands in november demanding an end to education cuts
the march route passed whitehall and the conservative party headquarters at millbank tower
as they marched past the building some protesters diverted in to the courtyard of millbank tower and began an occupation of the building
with an attendance of over people it was the largest british demonstration since the iraq war protest
this led to various more demos until the rise in tuition fees was passed
the day before the vote to allow a rise in tuition fees the daily telegraph reported that they had seen emails that suggested aaron porter had supported rather than increase tuition fees cuts of up to should be made to student support packages including grants and loans
porter responded to the claims on nus connect that in all of these meetings and communications we stated our firm and clear opposition to cuts and that the distortion of the discussions was political desperation from a coalition government losing the arguments on its own policies
on april the national union of students passed policy at its national conference to reverse its position on education funding
the call for a graduate tax was abandoned in favour of calls for free education funded through progressive taxation
the conference in blackpool was dominated by the governance review debate and vote
the proposals were for a restructuring of the running of the union but the vote was lost by votes a two thirds majority was required
the review was criticised for what was felt by detractors to be an attack on the organisation s democratic accountability
its supporters however defended the review as providing a more innovative corporate structure which was hoped to make it more credible in negotiating policy rather than simply reactive
this was not well received by many in the executive with president gemma tumelty vowing to press ahead with reform
the perceived lack of progress on governance reform also prompted imperial college union to hold a referendum on disaffiliation
in october nus national executive committee rejected a motion to condemn the militant group islamic state because some executive members felt that the wording of the motion being presented would unfairly demonise all muslims rather than solely the group of people it set out to rightfully condemn nus received criticism for this stance given its previous condemnation of the ukip political party
despite a statement from nus confirming that a new motion will be taken to the next nus national executive committee meeting which will specifically condemn the politics and methods of isis and offer solidarity for the kurdish people media coverage of the vote caused some students union members to speculate that the nus itself has been infiltrated by extremist sympathisers
at the following executive meeting on december a similar motion which condemned isis expressed solidarity with the kurdish people and called on nus to challenge islamophobia and all forms of racism being whipped up was resubmitted and easily passed
at the nus conference malia bouattia was elected president with of the vote defeating megan dunn who had sought relection
bouattia was soon subject to several allegations of antisemitism an october report by the house of commons home affairs select committee described her comments as outright racism and said that she was not taking issues of antisemitism on university campuses seriously enough
bouattia was condemned by over jewish student leaders the union of jewish students and oxford university student union
in response to her election students at durham loughborough hull aberystwyth oxford cambridge manchester essex york king s college london nottingham uwe leicester queen mary university of london and reading university began campaigning to disaffiliate from the nus
newcastle portsmouth hull and loughbrough disaffiliated the remainder maintained affiliation although nus reportedly broke campaigning rules at oxford cambridge and christ church
in april bouattia was defeated in her re election by shakira martin the union s vice president for further education who received of the vote
martin pledged unity pragmatism and putting nus back into the hands of its membership
moderate groups such as the organised independents and union of jewish students sought to reform the organisation to prevent further disaffiliations passing major democratic reform motions
the changes developed from two years of consultation with hundreds of students unions as well as legal and expert advice were described as the most comprehensive and wide ranging structural reforms in nus history
on november it was reported that the nus faced bankruptcy
the reforms had not been delivered and several years of financial mismanagement had created a significant decline in resources
martin wrote to members that the union would be taking urgent action to stabilise with reforms being developed for consideration and refinement with the help of our members
martin faced criticism for developing a drastic programme of financial governance and campaigning reforms for approval by the national conference however after around five hours of debate delegates voted in favour of the package
martin welcomed the vote calling it a momentous decision to endorse reform and deliver the vision of members
in nus official split into two organisations nus uk and nus charity
nus uk focuses on campaigning with students while nus charity focuses on supporting students unions
in may the uk government announced it would sever all ties with the nus on the basis claiming that it had failed to tackle antisemitic rot at the heart
the nus holds national conferences once a year
national conference is the sovereign body of nus and is where nus policy is decided
regional conferences are run to enhance the representation of members from scotland wales and northern ireland
prior to the reforms other conferences such as women s conference lesbian gay bisexual trans students conference changed as of disabled students conference black students conference mature and part time students conference and the international students conference created in were run to enhance the representation of the specific members they included
post the women s lgbt trans disabled and black students conferences have been merged into a single liberation conference and the mature and part time postgraduate and international students conferences are no longer in operation
in july due to the creation of a new nus london area the first nus london conference was held
most of these conferences and in particular the elections held at them are contested by factions including conservative labour students the young liberals national campaign against fees and cuts the organised independents young independence socialist students socialist workers student society student respect and liberation left
in addition to these political factions interest groups such as the federation of student islamic societies and the union of jewish students are deeply involved in the internal democratic processes of the nus
nus services provides collective purchasing support and marketing services to nus affiliated students unions
its shareholders consist of over nus affiliated students unions and it is directed by a board and committees composed of volunteers from these shareholder unions
the association for managers in students unions voted to merge with nus and nus services in
totum formerly known as nus extra is a discount card which can be purchased by students
it is produced by nus services in conjunction with nus and affiliated students unions receive a commission on every card sold to their members however the card is available to all students regardless of whether they are members of an affiliated student union or not
totum users are also eligible to apply for a nus pass approved identification card
nus has established a new charity to drive improvement in students unions
it will focus on students union quality talent management equality and diversity strategic development and turnaround ethical and environmental work and fundraising
ethical and environmental work
nus s ethical and environmental department originated in forming a committee tasked with investigating allegations of environmental bad practice at bass breweries
as of the department employs over members of staff delivering far reaching behavioural change programmes among staff and students such as green impact student switch off and student eats
in the department managed the pilot year of nus students green fund a million grant from hefce supporting student led transformative sustainability projects at students unions across england
in this department became an independent organisation called students organisation for sustainability uk
the nus has come in for criticism from those students unions who are not affiliated
sen ganesh then president of imperial college union said in that nus s claim to be representative of students is not borne out by their work especially as the nus is dominated by labour students and this diminishes the ability to address student issues in an impartial fashion
another criticism leveled at nus is the absence of direct democracy in electing national offices
officers of nus are elected at conferences by delegates chosen by affiliated unions of nus
critics from both within and outside the student movement have argued that consultation by unions with their members over who should represent the students union at national conferences is often minimal and some have argued in favour of changes to the nus constitution that would result in a one member one vote policy
the nus has also been criticised for prioritisation of nus extra over campaigning on issues which affect students
despite it being nus policy that none of the discounts on the original free nus card would be moved to nus extra proposed by cambridge university students union nus treasurer dave lewis did not follow policy and removed the discounts from the original free nus card
other critics have focussed on the organisation s perceived failure to campaign effectively on student issues such as tuition fees and prescription costs and have advocated that students and unions coordinate independently of the nus to campaign on the national stage
in the mid s nus faced a financial crisis caused by a coinciding of spiraling expenditure and decreasing income
a series of measures were proposed to address this of which the most controversial included a series of changes to the constitutional and democratic processes
in two emergency conferences passed some of the changes proposed albeit not without fierce dispute between those claiming the proposals were necessary reforms to maintain the existence of the organisation and those arguing that they were aimed at curbing democracy and involvement
the nus conference passed a policy which enabled nus to launch nus extra in september
in february the nus came under criticism after two of its officers forced a proposed debate on multiculturalism at the university of durham to be cancelled
the debate organised by the durham union society a debating society entirely separate from durham students union was to have featured two prominent british national party members yorkshire and the humber mep andrew brons and leeds city councillor chris beverley
upon hearing of bnp involvement in the debate nus black students officer bell ribeiro addy and nus lgbt officer daf adley jointly sent a letter to both the durham union society and the university demanding its cancellation
the pair stated that the debate would be illegal and threatened to organise a colossal demonstration in tandem with unite against fascism adding that if any students are hurt in and around this event responsibility will lie with you
the subsequent cancellation of the debate by durham union society president anna birley on safety grounds was met with fierce backlash
nus president wes streeting was prompted to personally appear before the durham union society to apologise for the actions of the officers concerned though outrage among durham students was sufficient that a significant number protested outside the debating chamber at the time
a protest group on facebook quickly amassed over members
an official petition was lodged with durham students union to call for a referendum on disaffiliation from nus
on march the referendum concluded with a majority of voting students choosing to disaffiliate
another referendum by those in favour of nus membership was called shortly following the no result and in january of durham students taking part in the referendum voted to reaffiliate with the nus on a turnout of compared with turnout to disaffiliate the previous year
in the run up to the general election the nus launched its liar liar campaign aimed at unseating mps who broke promises regarding the cost of education
at an estimated cost of and consisting of a social media campaign alongside billboards the campaign was well received by many students however also came under criticism for being politically motivated specifically against liberal democrat mps as opposed to members of all parties
posters promoting the campaign were also removed from several railway stations on the grounds that network rail is an arms length public sector body and must therefore remain politically neutral
the nus claimed that the removal of the posters was an attempt to gag the union
nus president toni pearce defended the union s actions saying that the breach of a promise regarding tuition fees wasn t a minor misdemeanour
it was an outright lie
we have an obligation to hold them to account for this and we will
