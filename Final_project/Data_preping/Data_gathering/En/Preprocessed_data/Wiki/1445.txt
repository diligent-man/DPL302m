the frankfurt school german frankfurter schule is a school of social theory and critical philosophy associated with the institute for social research at goethe university frankfurt in
founded in the weimar republic during the european interwar period the frankfurt school initially was comprised by intellectuals academics and political dissidents dissatisfied with the contemporary socio economic systems capitalist fascist communist of the s
the frankfurt theorists proposed that social theory was inadequate for explaining the turbulent political factionalism and reactionary politics occurring in th century liberal capitalist societies
critical of both capitalism and of marxism leninism as philosophically inflexible systems of social organization the school s critical theory research indicated alternative paths to realizing the social development of a society and a nation
the frankfurt school perspective of critical investigation open ended and self critical is based upon freudian marxist and hegelian premises of idealist philosophy
to fill the omissions of th century classical marxism which did not address th century social problems they applied the methods of antipositivist sociology of psychoanalysis and of existentialism
the school s sociologic works derived from syntheses of the thematically pertinent works of immanuel kant georg wilhelm friedrich hegel and karl marx of sigmund freud and max weber and of georg simmel and georg luk cs
like karl marx the frankfurt school concerned themselves with the conditions political economic societal that allow for social change realized by way of rational social institutions
their emphasis on the critical component of social theory derived from their attempts to overcome the ideological limitations of positivism materialism and determinism by returning to the critical philosophy of kant and his successors in german idealism principally the philosophy of hegel which emphasized dialectic and contradiction as intellectual properties inherent to the human grasp of material reality
since the s the critical theory work of the institute for social research has been guided by j rgen habermas s work in communicative rationality linguistic intersubjectivity and the philosophical discourse of modernity more recently the third generation critical theorists nikolas kompridis raymond geuss and axel honneth have opposed habermas s propositions claiming he has undermined the original social change purposes of critical theory problems such as what should reason mean analysis of the conditions necessary to realize social emancipation and critiques of contemporary capitalism
the term frankfurt school describes the works of scholarship and the intellectuals who were the institute for social research institut f r sozialforschung an adjunct organization at goethe university frankfurt founded in by carl gr nberg a marxist professor of law at the university of vienna
it was the first marxist research center at a german university and was funded through the largesse of the wealthy student felix weil
weil s doctoral dissertation dealt with the practical problems of implementing socialism
in he organized the first marxist workweek erste marxistische arbeitswoche in effort to synthesize different trends of marxism into a coherent practical philosophy the first symposium included gy rgy luk cs karl korsch karl august wittfogel and friedrich pollock
the success of the first marxist workweek prompted the formal establishment of a permanent institute for social research and weil negotiated with the ministry of education for a university professor to be director of the institute for social research thereby formally ensuring that the frankfurt school would be a university institution
korsch and luk cs participated in the arbeitswoche which included the study of marxism and philosophy by karl korsch but their communist party membership precluded their active participation in the institute for social research frankfurt school yet korsch participated in the school s publishing venture
moreover the political correctness by which the communists compelled luk cs to repudiate his book history and class consciousness indicated that political ideological and intellectual independence from the communist party was a necessary work condition for realizing the production of knowledge
the philosophical tradition of the frankfurt school the multi disciplinary integration of the social sciences is associated with the philosopher max horkheimer who became the director in and recruited intellectuals such as theodor w
adorno philosopher sociologist musicologist erich fromm psychoanalyst and herbert marcuse philosopher
in the weimar republic the continual political turmoils of the interwar years much affected the development of the critical theory philosophy of the frankfurt school
the scholars were especially influenced by the communists failed german revolution of which marx predicted and by the rise of nazism a german form of fascism
to explain such reactionary politics the frankfurt scholars applied critical selections of marxist philosophy to interpret illuminate and explain the origins and causes of reactionary socio economics in th century europe a type of political economy unknown to marx in the th century
the school s further intellectual development derived from the publication in the s of the economic and philosophical manuscripts of and the german ideology in which karl marx showed logical continuity with hegelianism as the basis of marxist philosophy
as the anti intellectual threat of nazism increased to political violence the founders decided to move the institute for social research out of nazi germany
soon after adolf hitler s rise to power in the institute first moved from frankfurt to geneva and then to new york city in where the frankfurt school joined columbia university
the school s journal the zeitschrift f r sozialforschung magazine of social research was renamed studies in philosophy and social science
thence began the period of the school s important work in marxist critical theory the scholarship and the investigational method gained acceptance among the academy in the u s and in the u k
by the s the paths of scholarship led horkheimer adorno and pollock to return to west germany whilst marcuse l wenthal and kirchheimer remained in the u s
in the institute for social research frankfurt school was formally re established in frankfurt west germany
as a term the frankfurt school usually includes the intellectuals max horkheimer theodor adorno herbert marcuse leo l wenthal and friedrich pollock
initially within the fs s inner circle j rgen habermas was the first to diverge from horkheimer s research program
the works of the frankfurt school are understood in the context of the intellectual and practical objectives of critical theory
in traditional and critical theory max horkheimer defined critical theory as social critique meant to effect sociologic change and realize intellectual emancipation by way of enlightenment that is not dogmatic in its assumptions
critical theory analyzes the true significance of the ruling understandings the dominant ideology generated in bourgeois society in order to show that the dominant ideology misrepresents how human relations occur in the real world and how capitalism justifies and legitimates the domination of people
in the praxis of cultural hegemony the dominant ideology is a ruling class narrative story which explains that what is occurring in society is the norm
nonetheless the story told through the ruling understandings conceals as much as it reveals about society
the task of the frankfurt school was sociological analysis and interpretation of the areas of social relation that marx did not discuss in the th century especially the base and superstructure aspects of a capitalist society
horkheimer opposed critical theory to traditional theory wherein the word theory is applied in the positivistic sense of scientism in the sense of a purely observational mode which finds and establishes scientific law generalizations about the real world
social sciences differ from natural sciences because their scientific generalizations cannot be readily derived from experience
the researcher s understanding of a social experience is always filtered through biases in the researcher s mind
the researcher does not understand is that he or she operates within an historical and ideological context
the results for the theory being tested would conform to the ideas of the researcher rather than the facts of the experience proper in traditional and critical theory horkheimer said
for horkheimer the methods of investigation applicable to the social sciences cannot imitate the scientific method applicable to the natural sciences
in that vein the theoretical approaches of positivism and pragmatism of neo kantianism and phenomenology failed to surpass the ideological constraints that restricted their application to social science because of the inherent logico mathematic prejudice that separates theory from actual life i e
such methods of investigation seek a logic that is always true and independent of and without consideration for continuing human activity in the field under study
he felt that the appropriate response to such a dilemma was the development of a critical theory of marxism
horkheimer believed the problem was epistemological saying we should reconsider not merely the scientist but the knowing individual in general unlike orthodox marxism which applies a template to critique and to action critical theory is self critical with no claim to the universality of absolute truth
as such it does not grant primacy to matter materialism or consciousness idealism because each epistemology distorts the reality under study to the benefit of a small group
in practice critical theory is outside the philosophical strictures of traditional theory however as a way of thinking and of recovering humanity s self knowledge critical theory draws investigational resources and methods from marxism
the frankfurt school reformulated dialectics into a concrete method of investigation derived from the hegelian philosophy that an idea will pass over into its own negation as the result of conflict between the inherently contradictory aspects of the idea
in opposition to previous modes of reasoning which viewed things in abstraction each by itself and as though endowed with fixed properties hegelian dialectics considers ideas according to their movement and change in time according to their interrelations and interactions
in hegel s perspective human history proceeds and evolves in a dialectical manner the present embodies the rational aufheben sublation the synthesis of past contradictions
it is an intelligible process of human activity the weltgeist which is the idea of progress towards a specific human condition the realization of human freedom through rationality
however the problem of future contingents considerations about the future did not interest hegel for whom philosophy cannot be prescriptive and normative because philosophy understands only in hindsight
the study of history is limited to descriptions of past and present human realities
for hegel and his successors the right hegelians dialectics inevitably lead to approval of the status quo as such dialectical philosophy justifies the bases of christian theology and of the prussian state
karl marx and the young hegelians strongly criticized that perspective hegel had over reached in his abstract conception of absolute reason and had failed to notice the real i e
undesirable and irrational life conditions of the proletariat
marx inverted hegel s idealist dialectics and advanced his own theory of dialectical materialism arguing that it is not the consciousness of men that determines their being but that their social being that determines their consciousness marx s theory follows a materialist conception of history and geographic space where the development of the productive forces is the primary motive force for historical change
the social and material contradictions inherent to capitalism lead to its negation thereby replacing capitalism with communism a new rational form of society
marx used dialectical analysis to uncover the contradictions in the predominant ideas of society and in the social relations to which they are linked exposing the underlying struggle between opposing forces
only by becoming aware of the dialectic i e
class consciousness of such opposing forces in a struggle for power can men and women intellectually liberate themselves and change the existing social order through social progress
the frankfurt school understood that a dialectical method could only be adopted if it could be applied to itself if they adopted a self correcting method a dialectical method that would enable the correction of previous false interpretations of the dialectical investigation
accordingly critical theory rejected the historicism and materialism of orthodox marxism
the epistemological aspects of the frankfurt school are linked to the presence of karl popper on the scene of philosophical and scientific thought of the th century
popper s response to philosophy indicates a link between critical theory and the crisis of scientific thought in the face of falsificationism
the boundaries of social disciplines are also involved in the revision of the debate on critical knowledge and dialectical reason
the bequests of authors such as adorno hans albert and j rgen habermas are also the text of the debate culminating with the affirmation of the second methodenstreit see guglielmo rinzivillo passato e presente nello sviluppo della teoria critica della societ su sociologia

the second phase of frankfurt school critical theory centres principally on two works adorno and horkheimer s dialectic of enlightenment and adorno s minima moralia
the authors wrote both works during the institute s exile in america
while retaining much of a marxian analysis these works critical shifted emphasis from a critique of capitalism to a critique of western civilization as seen in dialectic of enlightenment which uses the odyssey as a paradigm for their analysis of bourgeois consciousness
in these works horkheimer and adorno present many themes that have come to dominate social thought
their exposition of the domination of nature as a central characteristic of instrumental rationality in western civilization was made long before ecology and environmentalism became popular concerns
the analysis of reason now goes one stage further the rationality of western civilization appears as a fusion of domination and technological rationality bringing all of external and internal nature under the power of the human subject
in the process the subject gets swallowed up and no social force analogous to the proletariat can be identified that enables the subject to emancipate itself
hence the subtitle of minima moralia reflections from damaged life
in adorno s words
consequently at a time when it appears that reality itself has become the basis for ideology the greatest contribution that critical theory can make is to explore the dialectical contradictions of individual subjective experience on the one hand and to preserve the truth of theory on the other
even dialectical progress is put into doubt its truth or untruth is not inherent in the method itself but in its intention in the historical process this intention must be oriented toward integral freedom and happiness the only philosophy which can be responsibly practiced in face of despair is the attempt to contemplate all things as they would present themselves from the standpoint of redemption adorno distanced himself from the optimism of orthodox marxism beside the demand thus placed on thought the question of the reality or unreality of redemption i e
human emancipation itself hardly matters
from a sociological point of view horkheimer s and adorno s works contain an ambivalence concerning the ultimate source or foundation of social domination an ambivalence that gave rise to the pessimism of the new critical theory over the possibility of human emancipation and freedom
this ambivalence was rooted in the historical circumstances in which the work was originally produced in particular the rise of national socialism state capitalism and mass culture as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained within the terms of traditional marxist sociology
for adorno and horkheimer state intervention in the economy had effectively abolished the tension in capitalism between the relations of production and material productive forces of society a tension that according to traditional marxist theory constituted the primary contradiction within capitalism
the previously free market as an unconscious mechanism for the distribution of goods and irrevocable private property of marx s epoch gradually have been replaced by the more central role of management hierarchies at the firm level and macroeconomic interventions at the state level in contemporary western societies
the dialectic through which marx predicted the emancipation of modern society is suppressed effectively being subjugated to a positivist rationality of domination
about this second phase of the frankfurt school philosopher and critical theorist nikolas kompridis wrote
kompridis argues that this sceptical cul de sac was arrived at with a lot of help from the once unspeakable and unprecedented barbarity of european fascism and could not be gotten out of without some well marked exit or ausgang showing the way out of the ever recurring nightmare in which enlightenment hopes and holocaust horrors are fatally entangled however this ausgang according to kompridis would not come until later purportedly in the form of j rgen habermas s work on the intersubjective bases of communicative rationality
adorno a trained classical pianist wrote the philosophy of modern music in which he polemicized against popular music because it has become part of the culture industry of advanced capitalist society and the false consciousness that contributes to social domination
he argued that radical art and music may preserve the truth by capturing the reality of human suffering
hence
this view of modern art as producing truth only through the negation of traditional aesthetic form and traditional norms of beauty because they have become ideological is characteristic of adorno and of the frankfurt school generally
it has been criticized by those who do not share its conception of modern society as a false totality that renders obsolete traditional conceptions and images of beauty and harmony
in particular adorno despised jazz and popular music viewing it as part of the culture industry that contributes to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it aesthetically pleasing and agreeable
critics have highlighted several aspects of critical theory the alleged comfort of the early frankfurt school theorists the lack of a promise of a better future in adorno and horkheimer s works or the undue emphasis on psychiatric categories in their political criticism
habermas s reformulation of critical theory has been criticized as well as the frankfurt school s analysis of popular culture
in the theory of the novel georg luk cs criticized the leading german intelligentsia including some members of the frankfurt school adorno is named explicitly as inhabiting the grand hotel abyss a metaphorical place from which the theorists comfortably analyze the abyss the world beyond
luk cs described this contradictory situation as follows they inhabit a beautiful hotel equipped with every comfort on the edge of an abyss of nothingness of absurdity
and the daily contemplation of the abyss between excellent meals or artistic entertainments can only heighten the enjoyment of the subtle comforts offered
the seeming lack of a promise of a better future and the lack of a positive outlook on society in the works of adorno and horkheimer was criticized by karl popper in his addendum the frankfurt school
for popper marx s own condemnation of our society makes sense
for marx s theory contains the promise of a better future any theory becomes vacuous and irresponsible if the promise of a better future is omitted or not present in the theory
habermas s reformulation of critical theory has been accused by philosopher nikolas kompridis as solving too well the dilemmas of the philosophy of the subject and the problem of modernity s self reassurance while creating a self understanding of critical theory that is too close to liberal theories of justice and the normative order of society
he contended that while this has produced an important contemporary variant of liberal theories of justice different enough to be a challenge to liberal theory but not enough to preserve sufficient continuity with critical theory s past it severely weakened the identity of critical theory and inadvertently initiated its premature dissolution
the historian christopher lasch criticized the frankfurt school for their initial tendency to automatically reject opposing political criticisms based upon psychiatric grounds this procedure excused them from the difficult work of judgment and argumentation
instead of arguing with opponents they simply dismissed them on psychiatric grounds
during the s anti authoritarian socialists in the united kingdom and new zealand criticized the rigid and determinist view of popular culture deployed within the frankfurt school theories of capitalist culture which precluded any prefigurative role for social critique within such work
they argued that ec comics often did contain such cultural critiques
