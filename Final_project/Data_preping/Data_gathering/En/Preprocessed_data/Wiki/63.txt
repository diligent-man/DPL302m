During the s whenever Hollywood celebrities with vocal talents attended parties they were expected to perform songs In Loesser wrote Baby It's Cold Outside to sing with his wife Lynn Garland at their housewarming party in New York City at the Navarro Hotel They sang the song to indicate to guests that it was time to leave Garland has written that after the first performance We became instant parlor room stars We got invited to all the best parties for years on the basis of 'Baby' It was our ticket to caviar and truffles Parties were built around our being the closing act In after years of performing the song Loesser sold it to MGM for the romantic comedy Neptune's Daughter Garland was furious I felt as betrayed as if I'd caught him in bed with another woman
According to Esther Williams the producers of Neptune's Daughter had planned to use a different Loesser song I'd Like to Get You on a Slow Boat to China but studio censors thought it was too suggestive and replaced it with Baby

Since the song has faced criticism among some listeners for the alleged implications of its lyrics with elements such as the line Say what's in this drink and the Wolf's unrelenting pressure for the Mouse to remain in spite of her repeated suggestions that she should go home being described as suggestive of sexual harassment or even date rape
However others have noted that cultural expectations at the time of the song's writing were such that women were not socially permitted to spend the night with a boyfriend or fiancé and that the woman states that she wants to stay while What's in this drink was a common idiom of the period used to sidestep social expectations by blaming one's actions on the influence of alcohol Susan Loesser the daughter of songwriter Frank Loesser attributed the controversy to the song being associated with Bill Cosby after television programs such as Saturday Night Live and South Park satirically depicted it being performed by the comedian who had been accused of sexually assaulting numerous women and was convicted in one case that would eventually be overturned
In the airing of the song was cancelled by a number of radio stations including Canada's CBC streaming service after social media criticism and public pressure regarding the song's lyrics On November Cleveland Ohio radio station WDOK Star announced that it had removed the song from its playlist due to its lyric content based on listener input amid the Me Too movement On December the Canadian radio broadcasters Bell Media CBC Radio and Rogers Media followed suit The decision was divisive among critics and the general public with supporters arguing that the song's possible implications of date rape did not align with current societal norms and others arguing that the decision was an appeal to political correctness Station KOIT in San Francisco having placed the song on hold pending listener feedback returned it to the playlist after of respondents opposed its removal CBC Radio subsequently reinstated the song as well Following the controversy the song rose to the top of Billboard's digital sales list for the week of December with a increase in downloads
In vocalists John Legend and Kelly Clarkson also recorded the song with modified lyrics written by Legend and Natasha Rothwell for an expanded edition of Legend's A Legendary Christmas album The lyrical changes which included lines from the Wolf emphasizing sexual consent became a new source of controversy in their own right Deana Martin whose father Dean Martin had recorded a popular version of the song in criticized the new interpretation as absurd saying her father would not have approved of altering the lyrics which she maintained to be more sexually explicit in the new version than in Loesser's original in order to appease contemporary sensibilities
