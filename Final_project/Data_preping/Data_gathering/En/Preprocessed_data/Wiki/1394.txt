monty python s flying circus also known as simply monty python sometimes abbreviated mpfc is a british surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring graham chapman john cleese eric idle terry jones michael palin and terry gilliam who became known as monty python or the pythons
the first episode was recorded at the bbc on september and premiered on october on bbc with episodes airing over four series from to plus two episodes for german tv
the series stands out for its use of absurd situations mixed with risqu and innuendo laden humour sight gags and observational sketches without punchlines
live action segments were broken up with animations by gilliam often merging with the live action to form segues
the overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by spike milligan in his groundbreaking series q rather than the traditional sketch show format
the pythons play the majority of the series characters themselves along with supporting cast members including carol cleveland referred to by the team as the unofficial seventh python connie booth cleese s first wife series producer ian macnaughton ian davidson musician neil innes and fred tomlinson and the fred tomlinson singers for musical numbers
the programme came about as the six pythons having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the s sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on british television at the time
much of the humour in the series various episodes and sketches targets the idiosyncrasies of british life especially that of professionals as well as aspects of politics
their comedy is often pointedly intellectual with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works
the team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise and succeeded although by their perspective failed so completely that the adjective pythonesque was invented to define it and later similar material
however their humour was not always seen as appropriate for television by the bbc leading to some censorship during the third series
cleese left the show following that series and the remaining pythons completed a final shortened fourth series before ending the show
the show became very popular in the united kingdom and after initially failing to draw an audience in the united states gained american popularity after public broadcasting service member stations began airing the show in
the success on both sides of the atlantic led to the pythons going on live tours and creating three additional films while the individual pythons flourished in solo careers
monty python s flying circus has become an influential work on comedy as well as the ongoing popular culture
monty python s flying circus is a sketch comedy show though it does not adhere to any regular format
the sketches include live action skits performed by graham chapman john cleese eric idle terry jones michael palin and terry gilliam along with animations created by gilliam frequently used as linking devices or interstitial between skits
the show s introductory theme which varied with each series was also based on gilliam s animations its theme music set to the liberty bell march by john philip sousa and ending with a shot of the show s title before being crushed by a giant foot
gilliam selected the rendition of the march performed by the band of the grenadier guards published in as under the berne convention and united states copyright law the work had fallen into the public domain allowing them to avoid royalty payments
the title monty python s flying circus was partly the result of the group s reputation at the bbc
michael mills the bbc s head of comedy wanted their name to include the word circus because the bbc referred to the six members wandering around the building as a circus in particular baron von took s circus after barry took who had brought them to the bbc
the group added flying to make it sound less like an actual circus and more like something from world war i
the group was coming up with their name at a time when the royal guardsmen song snoopy vs
the red baron had been at a peak
freiherr manfred von richthofen the world war i german flying ace known as the red baron commanded the jagdgeschwader squadron of planes known as the flying circus
the words monty python were added because they claimed it sounded like a really bad theatrical agent the sort of person who would have brought them together with john cleese suggesting python as something slimy and slithery and eric idle suggesting monty
they later explained that the name monty made us laugh because monty to us means lord montgomery our great general of the second world war
the bbc had rejected some other names put forward by the group including whither canada the nose show ow it s colin plint a horse a spoon and a basin the toad elevating moment and owl stretching time
several of these titles were later used for individual episodes
compared with many other sketch comedy shows flying circus had fewer recurring characters many of whom were involved only in titles and linking sequences
continuity for many of these recurring characters was frequently non existent from sketch to sketch with sometimes even the most basic information such as a character s name being changed from one appearance to the next
the most frequently returning characters on the show include
the it s man palin a robinson crusoe type castaway with torn clothes and a long unkempt beard who would appear at the beginning of the programme
often he is seen performing a long or dangerous task such as falling off a tall jagged cliff or running through a mine field a long distance towards the camera before introducing the show by just saying it s before being abruptly cut off by the opening titles and terry gilliam s animation sprouting the words monty python s flying circus
it s was an early candidate for the title of the series
a bbc continuity announcer in a dinner jacket cleese seated at a desk often in highly incongruous locations such as a forest or a beach
his line and now for something completely different was used variously as a lead in to the opening titles and a simple way to link sketches
though cleese is best known for it idle first introduced the phrase in episode where he introduced a man with three buttocks
it eventually became the show s catchphrase and served as the title for the troupe s first movie
in series the line was shortened to simply and now and was often combined with the it s man in introducing the episodes the gumbys a dim witted group of identically attired people all wearing gumboots from which they take their name high water trousers braces fair isle tanktops white shirts with rolled up sleeves round wire rimmed glasses toothbrush moustaches and knotted handkerchiefs worn on their heads a stereotype of the english working class holidaymaker
gumbys always stand in a hunched square posture holding their arms stiffly at their sides with their balled hands curled inwards
they speak slowly in loud throaty voices punctuated by frequent grunts and groans display a poor understanding of everything they encounter and have a fondness for pointless violence
all of them are surnamed gumby d p
gumby r s
gumby etc
even though all pythons played gumbys in the show s run the character is most closely associated with michael palin
the knight with a raw chicken gilliam who would hit characters over the head with the chicken when they said something particularly silly
the knight was a regular during the first series and made another appearance in the third
a nude organist played in his first two appearances by gilliam later by jones who provided a brief fanfare to punctuate certain sketches most notably on a sketch poking fun at sale of the century or as yet another way to introduce the opening titles
this character was addressed as onan by palin s host character in the ersatz game show sketch blackmail
the pepper pots are screeching middle aged lower middle class housewives played by the pythons in frocks and frumpy hats and engage in surreal and inconsequential conversation
the pepper pots was the in house name that the pythons used to identify these characters who were never identified as such on screen
on the rare occasion these women were named it was often for comic effect featuring such names as mrs
scum mrs
non gorilla mrs
thing mrs
entity or the duo mrs
premise and mrs
conclusion
pepper pot refers to what the pythons believed was the typical body shape of middle class british housewives as explained by john cleese in how to irritate people
terry jones is perhaps most closely associated with the pepper pots but all the pythons were frequent in performing the drag characters
brief black and white stock footage lasting only two or three seconds of middle aged women sitting in an audience and applauding
the film was taken from a women s institute meeting and was sometimes presented with a colour tint other characters appearing multiple times include
the colonel chapman a british army officer who interrupts sketches that are too silly or that contain material he finds offensive
the colonel also appears when non bbc broadcast repeats need to be cut off for time constraints in syndication
arthur pewtey palin a socially inept extremely dull man who appears most notably in the marriage guidance counsellor and ministry of silly walks sketches
his sketches all take the form of an office appointment with an authority figure usually played by cleese which are used to parody the officious side of the british establishment by having the professional employed in the most bizarre field of expertise
the spelling of pewtey s surname is changed sometimes being spelled putey
the reverend arthur belling is the vicar of st loony up the cream bun and jam known for his deranged behaviour
in one sketch within series played by chapman he makes an appeal to the insane people of the world to drive sane people insane
in another sketch within series played by palin which is among the pantheon of fan favourites the vicar politely joins a honeymooning couple at an outdoor caf repeatedly insisting he does not wish to disturb them he then sits down opens a suitcase full of props and calmly proceeds to smash plates on the table shake a baby doll in their faces bounce a rubber crab from a ping pong paddle and spray shaving cream all over his face all whilst loudly chanting nonsense syllables
belling s odd version of not being disturbing serves to convert the couple to his bizarre sect of christianity
a somewhat disreputable shopkeeper played by palin is a staple of many a two person sketch notably dead parrot sketch
he often speaks with a strong cockney accent and has no consistent name
badger idle a scotsman whose specialty was interrupting sketches i won t ruin your sketch for a pound
he was once interviewed in a sketch opposite cleese regarding his interpretation of the magna carta which badger believes was actually a piece of chewing gum on a bedspread in dorset
he has also been seen as an aeroplane hijacker whose demands grow increasingly strange
eric praline a disgruntled man played by cleese and who often wears a pac a mac
his most famous appearance is in the dead parrot sketch
his name is only mentioned once on screen during the fish licence sketch but his attire together with cleese s distinctive nasal performance distinguishes him as a recognisable character who makes multiple appearances throughout the first two series
an audio re recording of fish licence also reveals that he has multiple pets of wildly differing species all of them named eric
arthur nudge a well dressed mustachioed man referred to in the published scripts as mr
nudge idle who pointedly annoys uptight characters usually jones
he is characterised by his constant nudging gestures and cheeky innuendo
his most famous appearance is in his initial sketch nudge nudge though he appears in several later sketches too including the visitors where he claimed his name was arthur name
biggles chapman and in one instance jones a world war i pilot
derived from the famous series of fiction stories by w
johns
luigi vercotti palin a mafioso entrepreneur and pimp featured during the first series accompanied in his first appearance by his brother dino jones
he appears as the manager for ron obvious the owner of la gondola restaurant and as a victim of the piranha brothers
with his brother he attempts to talk the colonel into paying for protection of his army base
the spanish inquisition would burst into a previously unrelated sketch whenever their name was mentioned
their catchphrase was nobody expects the spanish inquisition they consist of cardinal ximinez palin cardinal fang gilliam and cardinal biggles jones
they premiered in series two and ximinez had a cameo in the buzz aldrin show
frenchmen cleese and palin would sometimes dress in stereotypical french garb e g
striped shirt tight pants beret and speak in garbled french with incomprehensible accents
they had one fake moustache between them and each would stick it onto the other s lip when it was his turn to speak
they appear giving a demonstration of the technical aspects of the flying sheep in episode sex and violence and appear in the ministry of silly walks sketch as the developers of la marche futile
they also make an appearance in monty python and the holy grail
the comp re palin a sleazy nightclub emcee in a red jacket
he linked sketches by introducing them as nightclub acts and was occasionally seen after the sketch passing comment on it
in one link he was the victim of the knight with a raw chicken
spiny norman a gilliam animation of a giant hedgehog
he is introduced in episode of series in piranha brothers as an hallucination experienced by dinsdale piranha when he is depressed
later spiny norman appears randomly in the background of animated cityscapes shouting dinsdale
cardinal richelieu palin is impersonated by someone or is impersonating someone else
he is first seen as a witness in court but he turns out to be ron higgins a professional cardinal richelieu impersonator
he is later seen during the historical impersonations sketch as himself impersonating petula clark
ken shabby palin an unkempt disgusting man who cleaned public lavatories appeared in his own sketch in the first series attempting to get approval from another man chapman to marry his daughter booth
in the second series he appeared in several vox populi segments
he later founded his own religion as part of the crackpot religions sketch and called himself archbishop shabby
raymond luxury yacht chapman is described as one of britain s leading skin specialists

he proudly proclaims that his name is spelled raymond luxury yach t but it is pronounced throat wobbler mangrove
a madman chapman often appears in vox pops segments

he appears in the naked ant the buzz aldrin show and it s a living other returning characters include a married couple often mentioned but never seen ann haydon jones and her husband pip
in election night special pip has lost a political seat to engelbert humperdinck
several recurring characters are played by different pythons
both palin and chapman played the insanely violent police constable pan am
both jones and palin portrayed police sergeant harry snapper organs of q division
various historical figures were played by a different cast member in each appearance such as mozart cleese then palin or queen victoria jones then palin then all five pythons in series
some of the pythons real life targets recurred more frequently than others
reginald maudling a contemporary conservative politician was singled out for perhaps the most consistent ridicule
then secretary of state for education and science and well after the programme had ended prime minister margaret thatcher was occasionally mentioned in particular referring to thatcher s brain as being in her shin received a hearty laugh from the studio audience
then us president richard nixon was also frequently mocked as was conservative party leader edward heath prime minister for much of the series run
the british police were also a favourite target often acting bizarrely stupidly or abusing their authority frequently in drag
there were a total of episodes of monty python s flying circus made across four series
two episodes were produced in german for wdr westdeutscher rundfunk both entitled monty python s fliegender zirkus the literal german translation of the english title
while visiting the uk in the early s german entertainer and tv producer alfred biolek caught notice of the pythons
excited by their innovative absurd sketches he invited them to germany in and to write and act in two special german episodes
the first episode advertised as monty python s fliegender zirkus bl deln f r deutschland monty python s flying circus clowning around for germany was produced in and performed in german
the second episode advertised as monty python s fliegender zirkus bl deln auf die feine englische art monty python s flying circus clowning around in the distinguished english way produced in was recorded in english and dubbed into german for its broadcast in germany
the original english recording was transmitted by the bbc in october
prior to the show the six main cast members had met each other as part of various comedy shows jones and palin were members of the oxford revue while chapman cleese and idle were members of cambridge university s footlights and while on tour in the united states met gilliam
in various capacities the six worked on a number of different british radio and television comedy shows from to as both writers and on screen roles
the six began to collaborate on ideas together blending elements of their previous shows to devise the premise of a new comedy show which presented a number of skits with minimal common elements as if it were comedy presented by a stream of consciousness
this was aided through the use of gilliam s animations to help transition skits from one to the next
although there were few recurring characters and the six cast members played many diverse roles each perfected some character traits
graham chapman often portrayed straight laced men of any age or class frequently authority figures such as military officers policemen or doctors
his characters could at any moment engage in pythonesque maniacal behaviour and then return to their former sobriety
he was also skilled in abuse which he brusquely delivered in such sketches as argument clinic and flying lessons
he adopted a dignified demeanour as the leading straight man in the python feature films holy grail king arthur and life of brian the title character
john cleese played ridiculous authority figures
gilliam claims that cleese is the funniest of the pythons in drag as he barely needs to be dressed up to look hilarious with his square chin and cm frame see the mr
and mrs
git sketch
cleese also played intimidating maniacs such as an instructor in the self defence against fresh fruit sketch
his character mr
praline the put upon consumer featured in some of the most popular sketches most famously in dead parrot
one star turn that proved most memorable among python fans was the ministry of silly walks where he worked for the eponymous government department
the sketch displays the notably tall and loose limbed cleese s physicality in a variety of silly walks
despite its popularity particularly among american fans cleese himself particularly disliked the sketch feeling that many of the laughs it generated were cheap and that no balance was provided by what could have been the true satirical centrepoint
another of his trademarks is his over the top delivery of abuse particularly his screaming you bastard
cleese often played foreigners with ridiculous accents especially frenchmen most of the time with palin
sometimes this extended to the use of actual french or german such as the funniest joke in the world mr
hilter or la marche futile at the end of the ministry of silly walks but still with a very heavy accent or impossible to understand as for example hilter s speech
many python sketches were linked together by the cut out animations of terry gilliam including the opening titles featuring the iconic giant foot that became a symbol of all that was pythonesque
gilliam s unique visual style was characterised by sudden dramatic movements and deliberate mismatches of scale set in surrealist landscapes populated by engravings of large buildings with elaborate architecture grotesque victorian gadgets machinery and people cut from old sears roebuck catalogues
gilliam added airbrush illustrations and many familiar pieces of art
all of these elements were combined in incongruous ways to obtain new and humorous meanings
the surreal nature of the series allowed gilliam s animation to go off on bizarre imaginative tangents features that were impossible to produce live action at the time
some running gags derived from these animations were a giant hedgehog named spiny norman who appeared over the tops of buildings shouting dinsdale further petrifying the paranoid dinsdale piranha and the foot of cupid the giant foot that suddenly squashed things
the latter is appropriated from the figure of cupid in the agnolo bronzino painting venus cupid folly and time and appeared in the opening credits
notable gilliam sequences for the show include conrad poohs and his dancing teeth the rampage of the cancerous black spot the killer cars and a giant cat that stomps its way through london destroying everything in its path
initially only hired to be the animator of the series gilliam was not thought of even by himself as an on screen performer at first being american and not very good at the deep and sometimes exaggerated english accent of his fellows
the others felt they owed him something and so he sometimes appeared before the camera usually in the parts that no one else wanted to play generally because they required a lot of make up or involved uncomfortable costumes
the most recurrent of these was the knight who hits people with a chicken a knight in armour who would walk on set and hit another character on the head with a plucked chicken either to end a sketch or when they said something really corny
some of gilliam s other on screen portrayals included
a man with a stoat through his head
cardinal fang in the spanish inquisition
a dandy wearing only a mask bikini underwear and a cape in the visitors
a hotel clerk in the cycling tour episode
a trouser less man with a multi coloured wig and a goat on a lead asking for mrs
rogers at the start of the new gas cooker sketch
a fat and appallingly flatulent young man obsessed with and covered in baked beans in the most awful family in britain sketch
a wheelchair using security guard sporting an enormous sword through his head
percy bysshe shelley in the michael ellis episodegilliam soon became distinguished as the go to member for the most obscenely grotesque characters
this carried over into the holy grail film where gilliam played king arthur s hunchbacked page patsy and the bridgekeeper at the bridge of death as well as the deaf and mad jailer in life of brian
it has also been claimed that he was originally asked by terry jones to play mr
creosote in the meaning of life but turned it down
eric idle is known for his roles as a cheeky suggestive playboy nudge nudge a variety of pretentious television presenters such as his over the top portrayal of philip jenkinson in the segments connecting the cheese shop and salad days sketches a crafty slick salesman door to door joke salesman encyclopedia salesman and the merchant who loves to haggle in monty python s life of brian
he is acknowledged as the master of the one liner by the other pythons
he is also considered the best singer songwriter in the group for example he wrote and performed always look on the bright side of life from the life of brian
unlike jones he often played female characters in a more straightforward way only altering his voice slightly as opposed to the falsetto shrieking used by the others
several times idle appeared as upper class middle aged women such as rita fairbanks reenactment of the battle of pearl harbor and the sexually repressed protestant wife in the every sperm is sacred sketch in the meaning of life
because he was not from an already established writing partnership prior to python idle wrote his sketches alone
although all of the pythons played women terry jones is renowned by the rest to be the best rat bag woman in the business
his portrayal of a middle aged housewife was louder shriller and more dishevelled than that of any of the other pythons
examples of this are the dead bishop sketch his role as brian s mother mandy in life of brian mrs linda s c u m in mr neutron and the caf proprietor in spam
also recurring was the upper class reserved men in nudge nudge and the it s a man s life sketch and incompetent authority figures harry snapper organs
he also played the iconic nude organist that introduced all of series three
generally he deferred to the others as a performer but proved himself behind the scenes where he would eventually end up pulling most of the strings
jones also portrayed the tobacconist in the hungarian translation sketch and the enormously fat and bucket vomiting mr
creosote in meaning of life
michael palin was regarded by the other members of the troupe as the one with the widest range equally adept as a straight man or wildly over the top character
he portrayed many working class northerners often portrayed in a disgusting light the funniest joke in the world sketch and the every sperm is sacred segment of monty python s the meaning of life
in contrast palin also played weak willed put upon men such as the husband in the marriage guidance counsellor sketch or the boring accountant in the vocational guidance counsellor sketch
he was equally at home as the indefatigable cardinal ximinez of spain in the spanish inquisition sketch
another high energy character that palin portrays is the slick tv show host constantly smacking his lips together and generally being over enthusiastic blackmail sketch
in one sketch he plays the role with an underlying hint of self revulsion where he wipes his oily palms on his jacket makes a disgusted face then continues
one of his most famous creations was the shopkeeper who attempts to sell useless goods by very weak attempts at being sly and crafty which are invariably spotted by the customer often played by cleese as in the dead parrot and cheese shop sketches
palin is also well known for his leading role in the lumberjack song
palin also often plays heavy accented foreigners mostly french la marche futile or german hitler in minehead usually alongside cleese
in one of the last episodes he delivers a full speech first in english then in french then in heavily accented german
of all the pythons palin played the fewest female roles
among his portrayals of women are queen victoria in the michael ellis episode debbie katzenberg the american in monty python s the meaning of life a rural idiot s wife in the idiot in rural society sketch and an implausible english housewife who is married to jean paul sartre
the first five episodes of the series were produced by john howard davies with davies serving as studio director and ian macnaughton acting as location director
from the sixth episode onwards macnaughton became the producer and sole director on the series
other regular team members included hazel pethig costumes madelaine gaffney makeup and john horton video effects designer
maggie weston who worked on both makeup and design married gilliam in and they remain together
the series was primarily filmed in london studios and nearby locations although location shooting to take in beaches and villages included filming in somerset norwich and the island of jersey
pre production of the series had started by april
documents from the bbc showed that the viability of the show had been threatened around this time when cleese reminded the bbc that he was still under contract from david frost s david paradine productions who wanted to co produce the show
the bbc memos indicated the potential of holding off the show until when cleese s contract with paradine expired but ultimately the situation was resolved though the details of these negotiations have been lost
the first episode aired on the bbc on sunday october at p m
the bbc had to reassure some of its workers who were considering going on strike and who thought the show was replacing a late night religious devotional programme by asserting that it was using the alternative programming to give clergymen time off on their busiest day
the first episode did not fare well in terms of audience capturing only about of the total uk population roughly million compared to dad s army that had on the thursday of that same week
in addition to the lowest audience figures for shows during that week the first episode has had the lowest appreciation index for any of the bbc s light entertainment programmes
while public reception improved over the course of the first series certain bbc executives had already conceived a dislike for the show with some bbc documents describing the show as disgusting and nihilistic
some within the bbc had been more upbeat on how the first series had turned out and had congratulated the group accordingly but a more general dislike for the show had already made an impact on the troupe with cleese announcing that he would be unlikely to continue to participate after the making of the second series
separately the bbc had to re edit several of the first series episodes to remove the personal address and phone number for david frost that the troupe had included in some sketches
the second series while more popular than the first further strained relations between the troupe and the bbc
two of the sketches from the series finale royal episode were called out by bbc executives in a december meeting the queen will be watching in which the troupe mocks the uk national anthem and the undertakers sketch which took a comedic turn on how to dispose of the body of a loved one
the bbc executives criticised producer macnaughton for not alerting them to the content prior to airing
according to palin via his published diary the bbc started to censor the programme within the third series following this
cleese remained for the third series but left afterwards
cleese cited that he was no longer interested in the show believing most of the material was rehashes of prior skits
he also found it more difficult to work with chapman who was struggling with alcoholism at the time
the remaining pythons however went on to produce a shortened fourth series of which only six episodes were made prior to their decision to end the show prematurely the final episode being broadcast on december
the first cut that the bbc forced on the show was the removal of david frost s phone number from re airings of the second episode of the first season sex and violence in the sketch the mouse problem
the pythons had slipped in a real contact number for david frost to the initial airing which resulted in numerous viewers bothering him
some material originally recorded went missing later such as the use of the word masturbating in the summarize proust sketch which was muted during the first airing and later cut out entirely or what a silly bunt in the travel agent sketch which featured a character idle who has a speech impediment that makes him pronounce c s as b s which was cut before the sketch ever went to air
however when this sketch was included in the album monty python s previous record and the live at the hollywood bowl film the line remained intact
both sketches were included in the danish dr k re airing of all episodes episode aired november pm
some sketches were deleted in their entirety and later recovered
one such sketch is the party political broadcast choreographed where a conservative party spokesman cleese delivers a party political broadcast before getting up and dancing being coached by a choreographer idle and being joined by a chorus of spokesmen dancing behind him
the camera passes two labour party spokesmen practising ballet and an animation featuring edward heath in a tutu
once deemed lost a home recorded tape of this sketch captured from a broadcast from buffalo new york pbs outlet wned tv turned up on youtube in
another high quality recording of this sketch broadcast on wttw in chicago has also turned up on youtube
the buffalo version can be seen as an extra on the new region eight disc the complete monty python s flying circus dvd set
the region dvd of before the flying circus which is included in the complete monty python s flying circus collector s edition megaset and monty python the other british invasion also contains the buffalo version as an extra
another lost sketch is the satan animation following the crackpot religion piece and the cartoon religion ltd animation and preceding the how not to be seen sketch this had been edited out of the official tape
six frames of the animation can be seen at the end of the episode wherein that particular episode is repeated in fast forward
a black and white mm film print has since turned up found by a private film collector in the us showing the animation in its entirety
at least two references to cancer were censored both during the second series
in the sixth episode it s a living or school prizes carol cleveland s narration of a gilliam cartoon suddenly has a male voice dub gangrene over the word cancer although this word was used unedited when the animation appeared in the movie and now for something completely different the special terry gilliam s personal best uses this audio to restore the censored line
another reference was removed from the sketch conquistador coffee campaign in the eleventh episode how not to be seen although a reference to leprosy remained intact
this line has also been recovered from the same mm film print as the above mentioned satan animation
a sketch from episode of series subtitled the attila the hun show featured a parody of michael miles the s tv game show host played by cleese and was introduced as spot the braincell
this sketch was deleted shortly afterwards from a repeat broadcast as a mark of respect following miles death in february
also the controversial undertaker sketch from episode of the same series was removed by the bbc after negative reviewer response
both of these sketches have been restored to the official tapes although the only source for the undertaker sketch was an ntsc copy of the episode duplicated before the cut had been made
animation in episode of series was cut out following the initial broadcast
the animation was a parody of a german commercial and the original owners complained about the music use so the bbc simply removed part of the animation and replaced the music with a song from a python album
terry gilliam later complained about the cut thinking it was because producer ian mcnaughton just didn t get what it was and he cut it
that was a big mistake
music copyright issues have resulted in at least two cuts
in episode graham chapman as a pepperpot sings the girl from ipanema but some versions use jeanie with the light brown hair which is public domain
in the bus conductor sketch in episode a brief parody of tonight from west side story has been removed from recent releases
there have also been reports of substituting different performances of classical music in some uses presumably because of performance royalties
a region dvd release of series was released by sony in
this included certain things which had been cut from the us a e releases including the masturbation line but failed to reinstate most of the long lost sketches and edits
a blu ray release of the series featuring every episode restored to its original uncut broadcast length was released by network for the show s th anniversary in
rediscovered sketch ursula hitler once deemed impossible to find was rereleased with the th issue in
at the time of the original broadcasting of monty python in the united kingdom the bbc used time life television to distribute its shows in the united states
for monty python time life had been concerned that the show was too british in its humour to reach american audiences and did not opt to bring the programme across
however the show became a fixture on the canadian broadcasting corporation beginning in the fall of and hence was also seen in some american markets
the python s first film and now for something completely different a selection of skits from the show released in the uk in and in the united states in was not a hit in the usa
during their first north american tour in the pythons performed twice on us television firstly on the tonight show hosted by joey bishop and then on the midnight special
the group spoke of how badly the first appearance went down with the audience idle described the tonight show performance we did thirty minutes thirty minutes worth of material in fifteen minutes to no laughs whatsoever
we ran out onto the green grass in burbank and we lay down and laughed for minutes because it was the funniest thing ever
in america they didn t know what on earth we were talking about
despite the poor reception on their live appearances on american television the pythons american manager nancy lewis began to push the show herself into the states
in the pbs member station kera in dallas was the first television station in the united states to broadcast episodes of monty python s flying circus and is often credited with introducing the programme to american audiences
many other pbs stations acquired the show and by it was often the most popular show on these stations
and now for something completely different was re released to american theaters in and had a much better box office take that time
that would also set the stage for the pythons next film monty python and the holy grail released near simultaneously in the uk and the united states in april to also perform well in american theaters
the popularity of monty python s flying circus helped to open the door for other british television series to make their way into the united states via pbs and its member stations
one notable american fan of monty python was singer elvis presley
billy smith presley s cousin noted that during the last few months of elvis life in when elvis was addicted to prescription drugs and mainly confined to his bedroom at his mansion graceland elvis would sit at his room and chat with smith for hours about various topics including among other things presley s favourite monty python sketches
with the rise in american popularity the abc network acquired rights to show select episodes of monty python s flying circus in their wide world of entertainment showcase in mid
however abc re edited the episodes thus losing the continuity and flow intended in the originals
when abc refused to stop treating the series in this way the pythons took them to court
initially the court ruled that their artistic rights had indeed been violated but it refused to stop the abc broadcasts
however on appeal the team gained control over all subsequent us broadcasts of its programmes
the case also led to their gaining the master tapes of the series from the bbc once their original contracts ended at the end of
the show also aired on mtv in during the network s infancy monty python was part of a two hour comedy block on sunday nights that also included another bbc series the young ones
in april monty python s flying circus returned to non cable american television directly through pbs
in connection with this pbs commissioned monty python s personal best a six episode series featuring each python s favourite sketches plus a tribute to chapman who died in
bbc america has aired the series on a sporadic basis since the mid s in an extended minute time slot in order to include commercials
ifc acquired the rights to the show in though not exclusive as bbc america still airs occasional episodes of the show
ifc also presented a six part documentary monty python almost the truth the lawyers cut produced by terry jones s son bill
the members of monty python embarked on a series of stage shows during and after the television series
these mostly consisted of sketches from the series though they also revived material which predated it
one such sketch was the four yorkshiremen sketch written by cleese and chapman with marty feldman and tim brooke taylor and originally performed for at last the show the sketch subsequently became part of the live python repertoire
the shows also included songs from collaborator neil innes

in a troupe of actors headed by r my renoux translated and adapted a stage version of monty python s flying circus into french
usually the original actors defend their material very closely but given in this case the adaptation and also the translation into french with subtitles the group supported this production
the adapted material sticks close to the original text mainly deviating when it comes to ending a sketch something the python members themselves changed many times over the course of their stage performances
language differences also occur in the lyrics of several songs
for example sit on my face which translated into french would be asseyez vous sur mon visage becomes cum in my mouth
