The emergence of anti Russian sentiment in the Danubian Principalities the precursors to unified Romania which became independent of the Ottoman Empire with the Treaty of Adrianople concluding the Russo Turkish War arose from the post relationship of the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia to Russia and was caused by mutually economic and political grievances of two influential classes that were often odds also with each other As per the treaty Russia was named the protector of the two principalities allowed to occupy them and also drafted a quasi constitution known as the Organic Regulations which formed a powerful assembly of boyars the local landowning economic elite nominally under the authority of the less nominal prince the document crafted with strong support from the boyars The boyars a reactionary oligarchy as described by Misha Glenny stopped short any hint of liberal reform and the growing urban elite began to associate Russia with the slow progress of reform and the obstacles they faced in building an industrial base On the other hand the boyars themselves began to sour on Russia during the s and s due to their economic conflict of interest with Russia After the Ottomans withdrew from the three forts along the Danube basin the boyars exploited the highly fertile land to drastically increase Romanian wheat production such that eventually future Romania consisting of Wallachia unified with Moldavia would become the fourth largest wheat producer in the world Whereas before Wallachian and Moldavian wheat had been limited to Ottoman markets Russia increasingly felt threatened by growing competition in its jurisdiction that it feared could drive down the price of Russian wheat Accordingly Russia exploited its role as protector of the Principalities to let the Danube silt up sabotaging the possible market competitor As a result of this as well as Russian foot dragging on the economy the boyars too became increasingly resentful of Russian domination The rapid erosion of public relations with Russia led to a revolution in in which the newly emerging Romanian intellectual and political class sought the help of the Ottomans their old hegemon to drive out Russian influence although after pressure applied by Russia the Russian and Ottoman armies joined forces to squash the movement
