according to estonian philosopher jaan kaplinski the birth of anti russian sentiment in estonia dates back to as there was little or none during the czarist and first independence period when anti german sentiment predominated
kaplinski states the imposition of soviet rule under joseph stalin in and subsequent actions by soviet authorities led to the replacement of anti german sentiment with anti russian sentiment within just one year and characterized it as one of the greatest achievements of the soviet authorities
kaplinski supposes that anti russian sentiment could disappear as quickly as anti german sentiment did in however he believes the prevailing sentiment in estonia is sustained by estonia s politicians who employ the use of anti russian sentiments in political combat together with the tendentious attitude of the estonian media kaplinski says that a rigid east west attitude is to be found to some degree in estonia when it comes to russia in the form that everything good comes from the west and everything bad from the east this attitude in kaplinski s view probably does not date back further than and presumably originates from nazi propaganda
according to the moscow times latvia s fears of russia are rooted in recent history including conflicting views on whether latvia and other baltic states were occupied by the ussr or joined it voluntarily as well as the june and march deportations that followed and most recently the annexation of crimea that fueled a fear that latvia could also be annexed by russia
russian american journalist and broadcaster vladimir pozner believed the fact that many russians who had migrated to the latvian ssr did not learn latvian and expected the local population to speak russian also had contributed to an accumulation of anti russian sentiment
ever since latvia regained its independence in various russian officials journalists academics and pro russian activists have criticised latvia for its latvian language law and latvian nationality law and repeatedly accused it of ethnic discrimination against russians anti russian sentiment and russophobia
as early as boris yeltsin president of russia and andrei kozyrev minister of foreign affairs declared that latvia is preparing for an ethnic cleansing and even in co chairman of the latvian russian union and former mep tatjana danoka likened the situation of russians and russian speakers and their alleged persecution in latvia to jews before the world war ii
however no russians have ever been killed or even wounded for political nationalistic or racist reasons in latvia ever since it regained its independence and in a poll only of the russian minority in latvia reported having experienced a racially motivated hate crime as compared to an average of among immigrants and minorities in eu
an earlier research ethnic tolerance and integration of the latvian society by the baltic institute of social sciences found that latvian respondents on average rated their relations with russians out of whereas non latvian respondents rated their relationship with latvians out of
both groups believed that the ties between them were satisfactory had not changed in the last five years and were to either remain the same or improve in the next five years
of non russian respondents said they would also support their son or daughter marrying an ethnic russian
respondents did mention some conflicts on an ethnic basis but all of them were classified as psycholinguistic such as verbal confrontations
russians in latvia at times had been targeted by anti russian rhetoric from some of the more radical members of both the mainstream and radical right parties in latvia
in civic union s internal e mail correspondence between minister for foreign affairs of latvia irts valdis kristovskis and latvian american doctor and party member aivars slucis was leaked
in one of the e mails titled do latvians surrender slucis complained of the current situation in latvia and being unable to return and work in latvia because he would not be able to treat russians in the same way as latvians
kristovskis agreed with his opinion and evaluation but warned against hysterical responses cautioning party members to avoid discussions counterproductive to the party s political goals
after the leak the civic union ousted slucis from the party for views unacceptable to the party and returned his financial contributions while the opposition parties harmony centre and for a good latvia initiated an unsuccessful vote of no confidence against kristovskis
on the other hand the results of a yearly poll by the research agency skds show that the population of latvia was more split on its attitude towards the russian federation
in percent of respondents had a positive view of russia and had a negative one while the remaining percent found it hard to define their opinion
it peaked in when percent of respondents felt positive towards russia in comparison with the percent that felt negative
in following the annexation of crimea by the russian federation however it dropped to the lowest level since and for the first time the people with a negative attitude towards russia surpassed people with a positive attitude

ever since the independence of moldova russia has been repeatedly accused by various local politicians and elected officials of meddling in moldovan politics notably by andrian candu a moldovan senator
russia s involvement with pro russian separatists in transnistria further strained the relations between russia and moldova and prime minister of moldova pavel filip demanded russia to quit the region
in the parliament of moldova unanimously adopted a declaration condemning what it called russian attacks on national informational security and meddling in internal politics
anti russian sentiment dates back to the conflict between the russian and ottoman empires in the th and early th centuries and the ceding of part of the moldavian principality to russia by the ottoman empire in after its de facto annexation and to the annexations during world war ii and after by the soviet union of northern bukovina and bessarabia and the policies of ethnic cleansing russification and deportations that have taken place in those territories against ethnic romanians
following wwii romania a former ally of nazi germany was occupied by soviet forces
soviet dominance over the romanian economy was manifested through the so called sovroms exacting a tremendous economic toll ostensibly as war time reparations
the emergence of anti russian sentiment in the danubian principalities the precursors to unified romania which became independent of the ottoman empire with the treaty of adrianople concluding the russo turkish war arose from the post relationship of the danubian principalities of wallachia and moldavia to russia and was caused by mutually economic and political grievances of two influential classes that were often odds also with each other
as per the treaty russia was named the protector of the two principalities allowed to occupy them and also drafted a quasi constitution known as the organic regulations which formed a powerful assembly of boyars the local landowning economic elite nominally under the authority of the less nominal prince the document crafted with strong support from the boyars
the boyars a reactionary oligarchy as described by misha glenny stopped short any hint of liberal reform and the growing urban elite began to associate russia with the slow progress of reform and the obstacles they faced in building an industrial base
on the other hand the boyars themselves began to sour on russia during the s and s due to their economic conflict of interest with russia
after the ottomans withdrew from the three forts along the danube basin the boyars exploited the highly fertile land to drastically increase romanian wheat production such that eventually future romania consisting of wallachia unified with moldavia would become the fourth largest wheat producer in the world
whereas before wallachian and moldavian wheat had been limited to ottoman markets russia increasingly felt threatened by growing competition in its jurisdiction that it feared could drive down the price of russian wheat
accordingly russia exploited its role as protector of the principalities to let the danube silt up sabotaging the possible market competitor
as a result of this as well as russian foot dragging on the economy the boyars too became increasingly resentful of russian domination
the rapid erosion of public relations with russia led to a revolution in in which the newly emerging romanian intellectual and political class sought the help of the ottomans their old hegemon to drive out russian influence although after pressure applied by russia the russian and ottoman armies joined forces to squash the movement

the ultranationalist party svoboda once prominent but now marginal has invoked radical anti russian rhetoric and has electoral support enough to garner majority support in local councils as seen in the ternopil regional council in western ukraine
analysts explained svoboda s victory in eastern galicia during the ukrainian local elections as a result of the policies of the azarov government who were seen as too pro russian by the voters of svoboda
according to andreas umland senior lecturer in political science at the national university of kyiv mohyla academy svoboda s increasing exposure in the ukrainian media has contributed to these successes
according to british academic taras kuzio the presidency of viktor yanukovich fabricated this exposure in order to discredit the opposition
since the euromaidan revolution the svoboda party lost a lot of its support
in the ukrainian parliamentary election svoboda formed a united party list with the governmental initiative of yarosh right sector and national corps
the united list received only of the votes less than half of the election threshold and thus no parliamentary seats via the national party list

depictions of russia by british travel writers and newspaper correspondents described the country as a semi barbaric and despotic country an image which ingrained itself in the british public consciousness as such depictions were frequently published in the uk media these depictions had the effect of increasing russophobia in britain despite growing economic and political ties between the two countries

california based international relations scholar andrei tsygankov has remarked that anti russian political rhetoric coming from washington circles has received wide echo in american mainstream media asserting that russophobia s revival is indicative of the fear shared by some u s

in practice anti russian political rhetoric usually puts emphasis on highlighting policies and practices of the russian government that are criticised internally corruption abuse of law censorship violence and intervention in ukraine
western criticism in this aspect goes in line with russian independent anti government media such as dozhd novaya gazeta echo of moscow the moscow times and opposition human rights activists memorial
