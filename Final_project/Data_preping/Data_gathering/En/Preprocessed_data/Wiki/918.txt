John Wesley Coombs (November 18, 1882 – April 15, 1957), nicknamed "Colby Jack" after his alma mater, was an American professional baseball player
He played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Philadelphia Athletics (1906–14), Brooklyn Robins (1915–18), and Detroit Tigers (1920)
In 1910, Coombs won 31 games during the regular season and three games in the World Series to lead the Athletics to the championship
A two-way player, he also occasionally played as an outfielder.
Born in LeGrand, Iowa, Coombs moved to Kennebunk, Maine with his family at the age of four
He played baseball in high school in Freeport, Maine, and in 1901–02 for Coburn Classical prep school in Waterville
Coombs was a 1906 graduate of Colby College in Waterville, where he was a chemistry major and a member of Delta Upsilon
He also participated in football, track, and tennis
Colby's baseball field is named for him.
Three weeks after graduating, Coombs pitched in his first major league game for the Philadelphia Athletics, a seven-hit shutout, defeating the Washington Senators 3–0
He finished 1906 with a 10–10 record and 2.50 earned run average
In 1906, he pitched the longest complete game in the American League, 24 innings against Boston, winning 4–1
The following year, Coombs went 6–9 with a 3.12 ERA
In 1908 and 1909, his record was only 19–16 despite his ERA being 2.00 and 2.32 those years.
Coombs' best season was 1910, which is still one of the best pitching seasons in MLB history
Besides his record of 31–9, he had an ERA of 1.30 and led the American League in wins (31), games played (45), and shutouts (13), which is still the single-season AL record
He won 18 of 19 starts that July and racked up 53 consecutive scoreless innings, which stood as the major league record until Walter Johnson broke it three years later
Don Drysdale and Orel Hershiser later surpassed Johnson's mark
Coombs became one of only 13 pitchers to win 30 games in a season since 1900
He then won three games in the 1910 World Series, in which the Athletics defeated the Chicago Cubs.
In 1911, Coombs led the AL in wins again with 28, even though his ERA went up to 3.53
He won one game in the 1911 World Series, as the Athletics repeated as champions
The following year, he won 21 games.
Coombs did not play much in 1913 and 1914
The Athletics released him, and he signed with the Brooklyn Robins, for whom he played from 1915 to 1918
In the 1916 World Series, he won a game, but the Robins lost the series.
In 1919, Coombs was the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies for 62 games, going 18–44 before being replaced by Gavvy Cravath
He returned to play one final year in 1920 for the Detroit Tigers before retiring
Coombs finished his MLB career with a 158–110 record, a 2.78 ERA, and 1,052 strikeouts.

He played 62 games in the outfield during his career
In six World Series games, he hit .333 (8-for-24) with 4 RBI.
