in britain a workhouse welsh tloty was a total institution where those unable to support themselves financially were offered accommodation and employment
in scotland they were usually known as poorhouses the earliest known use of the term workhouse is from in an account by the mayor of abingdon reporting that we have erected wthn sic our borough a workhouse to set poorer people to work
the origins of the workhouse can be traced to the statute of cambridge which attempted to address the labour shortages following the black death in england by restricting the movement of labourers and ultimately led to the state becoming responsible for the support of the poor
however mass unemployment following the end of the napoleonic wars in the introduction of new technology to replace agricultural workers in particular and a series of bad harvests meant that by the early s the established system of poor relief was proving to be unsustainable
the new poor law of attempted to reverse the economic trend by discouraging the provision of relief to anyone who refused to enter a workhouse
some poor law authorities hoped to run workhouses at a profit by utilising the free labour of their inmates
most were employed on tasks such as breaking stones crushing bones to produce fertiliser or picking oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike
as the th century wore on workhouses increasingly became refuges for the elderly infirm and sick rather than the able bodied poor and in legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals
although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in many continued under their new appellation of public assistance institutions under the control of local authorities
it was not until the introduction of the national assistance act that the last vestiges of the poor law finally disappeared and with them the workhouses
the statute of cambridge was an attempt to address the labour shortage caused by the black death a devastating pandemic that killed about one third of england s population
the new law fixed wages and restricted the movement of labourers as it was anticipated that if they were allowed to leave their parishes for higher paid work elsewhere then wages would inevitably rise
according to historian derek fraser the fear of social disorder following the plague ultimately resulted in the state and not a personal christian charity becoming responsible for the support of the poor
the resulting laws against vagrancy were the origins of state funded relief for the poor
from the th century onwards a distinction was legally enshrined between those who were willing to work but could not and those who were able to work but would not between the genuinely unemployed and the idler
supporting the destitute was a problem exacerbated by king henry viii s dissolution of the monasteries which began in
they had been a significant source of charitable relief and provided a good deal of direct and indirect employment
the poor relief act of went on to establish the principle that if the able bodied poor needed support they had to work for it
the act for the relief of the poor made parishes legally responsible for the care of those within their boundaries who through age or infirmity were unable to work
the act essentially classified the poor into one of three groups
it proposed that the able bodied be offered work in a house of correction the precursor of the workhouse where the persistent idler was to be punished
it also proposed the construction of housing for the impotent poor the old and the infirm although most assistance was granted through a form of poor relief known as outdoor relief money food or other necessities given to those living in their own homes funded by a local tax on the property of the wealthiest in the parish
the workhouse system evolved in the th century allowing parishes to reduce the cost to ratepayers of providing poor relief
the first authoritative figure for numbers of workhouses comes in the next century from the abstract of returns made by the overseers of the poor which was drawn up following a government survey in
it put the number of parish workhouses in england and wales at more than about one parish in seven with a total capacity of more than places
this growth in the number of workhouses was prompted by the workhouse test act by obliging anyone seeking poor relief to enter a workhouse and undertake a set amount of work usually for no pay a system called indoor relief the act helped prevent irresponsible claims on a parish s poor rate
the growth was also bolstered by the relief of the poor act proposed by thomas gilbert
gilbert s act was intended to allow parishes to share the cost of poor relief by joining together to form unions known as gilbert unions to build and maintain even larger workhouses to accommodate the elderly and infirm
the able bodied poor were instead either given outdoor relief or found employment locally
relatively few gilbert unions were set up but the supplementing of inadequate wages under the speenhamland system did become established towards the end of the th century
so keen were some poor law authorities to cut costs wherever possible that cases were reported of husbands being forced to sell their wives to avoid them becoming a financial burden on the parish
in one such case in the wife and child of henry cook who were living in effingham workhouse were sold at croydon market for one shilling p the parish paid for the cost of the journey and a wedding dinner
by the s most parishes had at least one workhouse but many were badly managed
in his work the state of the poor sir frederick eden wrote
instead of a workhouse some sparsely populated parishes placed homeless paupers into rented accommodation and provided others with relief in their own homes
those entering a workhouse might join anywhere from a handful to several hundred other inmates for instance between and liverpool s workhouse accommodated indigent men women and children
the larger workhouses such as the gressenhall house of industry generally served a number of communities in gressenhall s case parishes
writing in poor law commissioner george nicholls viewed many of them as little more than factories
by the amount spent on poor relief nationally had risen to million a year more than shillings per head of population up from million in
the large number of those seeking assistance was pushing the system to the verge of collapse
the economic downturn following the end of the napoleonic wars in the early th century resulted in increasing numbers of unemployed
coupled with developments in agriculture that meant less labour was needed on the land along with three successive bad harvests beginning in and the swing riots of reform was inevitable
many suspected that the system of poor relief was being widely abused
in the government established a royal commission to investigate and recommend how relief could best be given to the poor
the result was the establishment of a centralised poor law commission in england and wales under the poor law amendment act also known as the new poor law which discouraged the allocation of outdoor relief to the able bodied all cases were to be offered the house and nothing else
individual parishes were grouped into poor law unions each of which was to have a union workhouse
more than of these were built during the next years two thirds of them by
in certain parts of the country there was a good deal of resistance to these new buildings some of it violent particularly in the industrial north
many workers lost their jobs during the major economic depression of and there was a strong feeling that what the unemployed needed was not the workhouse but short term relief to tide them over
by poor law unions had been formed in england and wales incorporating parishes but it was not until that unions were established across the entire country the same year that the new poor law was applied to the gilbert unions
despite the intentions behind the act relief of the poor remained the responsibility of local taxpayers and there was thus a powerful economic incentive to use loopholes such as sickness in the family to continue with outdoor relief the weekly cost per person was about half that of providing workhouse accommodation
outdoor relief was further restricted by the terms of the outdoor relief prohibitory order which aimed to end it altogether for the able bodied poor
in of million paupers only were maintained in workhouses of whom were considered to be able bodied leaving an estimated of the able bodied on outdoor relief
excluding periods of extreme economic distress it has been estimated that about of the british population may have been accommodated in workhouses at any given time
the new poor law commissioners were very critical of existing workhouses and generally insisted that they be replaced
they complained in particular that in by far the greater number of cases it is a large almshouse in which the young are trained in idleness ignorance and vice the able bodied maintained in sluggish sensual indolence the aged and more respectable exposed to all the misery that is incident to dwelling in such a society
after many workhouses were constructed with the central buildings surrounded by work and exercise yards enclosed behind brick walls so called pauper bastilles
the commission proposed that all new workhouses should allow for the segregation of paupers into at least four distinct groups each to be housed separately the aged and impotent children able bodied males and able bodied females
a common layout resembled jeremy bentham s prison panopticon a radial design with four three storey buildings at its centre set within a rectangular courtyard the perimeter of which was defined by a three storey entrance block and single storey outbuildings all enclosed by a wall
that basic layout one of two designed by the architect sampson kempthorne his other design was octagonal with a segmented interior sometimes known as the kempthorne star allowed for four separate work and exercise yards one for each class of inmate
separating the inmates was intended to serve three purposes to direct treatment to those who most needed it to deter others from pauperism and as a physical barrier against illness physical and mental
the commissioners argued that buildings based on kempthorne s plans would be symbolic of the recent changes to the provision of poor relief one assistant commissioner expressed the view that they would be something the pauper would feel it was utterly impossible to contend against and give confidence to the poor law guardians
another assistant commissioner claimed the new design was intended as a terror to the able bodied population but the architect george gilbert scott was critical of what he called a set of ready made designs of the meanest possible character
some critics of the new poor law noted the similarities between kempthorne s plans and model prisons and doubted that they were merely coincidental richard oastler went as far as referring to the institutions as prisons for the poor
augustus pugin compared kempthorne s octagonal plan with the antient poor hoyse in what felix driver calls a romantic conservative critique of the degeneration of english moral and aesthetic values
by the s some of the enthusiasm for kempthorne s designs had waned
with limited space in built up areas and concerns over the ventilation of buildings some unions moved away from panopticon designs
between and about workhouses with separate blocks designed for specific functions were built
typically the entrance building contained offices while the main workhouse building housed the various wards and workrooms all linked by long corridors designed to improve ventilation and lighting
where possible each building was separated by an exercise yard for the use of a specific category of pauper
each poor law union employed one or more relieving officers whose job it was to visit those applying for assistance and assess what relief if any they should be given
any applicants considered to be in need of immediate assistance could be issued with a note admitting them directly to the workhouse
alternatively they might be offered any necessary money or goods to tide them over until the next meeting of the guardians who would decide on the appropriate level of support and whether or not the applicants should be assigned to the workhouse
workhouses were designed with only a single entrance guarded by a porter through which inmates and visitors alike had to pass
near to the entrance were the casual wards for tramps and vagrants and the relieving rooms where paupers were housed until they had been examined by a medical officer
after being assessed the paupers were separated and allocated to the appropriate ward for their category boys under able bodied men between and men over girls under able bodied women between and and women over
children under the age of two were allowed to remain with their mothers but by entering a workhouse paupers were considered to have forfeited responsibility for their families
clothing and personal possessions were taken from them and stored to be returned on their discharge
after bathing they were issued with a distinctive uniform for men it might be a striped cotton shirt jacket and trousers and a cloth cap and for women a blue and white striped dress worn underneath a smock
shoes were also provided
in some establishments certain categories of inmate were marked out by their clothing for example at bristol incorporation workhouse prostitutes were required to wear a yellow dress and pregnant single women a red dress such practices were deprecated by the poor law commission in a directive issued in entitled ignominious dress for unchaste women in workhouses but they continued until at least
some workhouses had a separate foul or itch ward where inmates diagnosed with skin diseases such as scabies could be detained before entering the workhouse proper
also not to be overlooked were unfortunate destitute sufferers of mental health disorders who would be ordered to enter the workhouse by the parish doctor
the lunacy act did promote the asylum as the institution of choice for patients afflicted with all forms of mental illness
however in reality destitute people suffering from mental illness would be housed in their local workhouse
conditions in the casual wards were worse than in the relieving rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants who were considered potential troublemakers and probably disease ridden
vagrants who presented themselves at the door of a workhouse were at the mercy of the porter whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward
those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the vagrancy act
a typical early th century casual ward was a single large room furnished with some kind of bedding and perhaps a bucket in the middle of the floor for sanitation
the bedding on offer could be very basic the poor law authorities in richmond in london in the mid s provided only straw and rags although beds were available for the sick
in return for their night s accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day for instance at guisborough men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum two hours before breakfast and one after
until the passage of the casual poor act vagrants could discharge themselves before am on the day following their admission but from onwards they were required to be detained until am on the second day
those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission
inmates were free to leave whenever they wished after giving reasonable notice generally considered to be three hours but if a parent discharged him or herself then the children were also discharged to prevent them from being abandoned
the comic actor charlie chaplin who spent some time with his mother in lambeth workhouse records in his autobiography that when he and his half brother returned to the workhouse after having been sent to a school in hanwell he was met at the gate by his mother hannah dressed in her own clothes
desperate to see them again she had discharged herself and the children they spent the day together playing in kennington park and visiting a coffee shop after which she readmitted them all to the workhouse
available data surrounding death rates within the workhouse system is minimal however in the wall to wall documentary secrets from the workhouse it s estimated that of those admitted to the workhouse after the poor law amendment act died within the system
some poor law authorities hoped that payment for the work undertaken by the inmates would produce a profit for their workhouses or at least allow them to be self supporting but whatever small income could be produced never matched the running costs
in the th century inmates were poorly managed and lacked either the inclination or the skills to compete effectively with free market industries such as spinning and weaving
some workhouses operated not as places of employment but as houses of correction a role similar to that trialled by buckinghamshire magistrate matthew marryott
between and he experimented with using the workhouse as a test of poverty rather than a source of profit leading to the establishment of a large number of workhouses for that purpose
nevertheless local people became concerned about the competition to their businesses from cheap workhouse labour
as late as for instance the firewood cutters protection association was complaining that the livelihood of its members was being threatened by the cheap firewood on offer from the workhouses in the east end of london
many inmates were allocated tasks in the workhouse such as caring for the sick or teaching that were beyond their capabilities but most were employed on generally pointless work such as breaking stones or removing the hemp from telegraph wires
others picked oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike which may be the source of the workhouse s nickname
bone crushing useful in the creation of fertiliser was a task most inmates could perform until a government inquiry into conditions in the andover workhouse in found that starving paupers were reduced to fighting over the rotting bones they were supposed to be grinding to suck out the marrow
the resulting scandal led to the withdrawal of bone crushing as an employment in workhouses and the replacement of the poor law commission by the poor law board in
conditions were thereafter regulated by a list of rules contained in the consolidated general order which included guidance on issues such as diet staff duties dress education discipline and redress of grievances
some poor law unions opted to send destitute children to the british colonies in particular to canada and australia where it was hoped the fruits of their labour would contribute to the defence of the empire and enable the colonies to buy more british exports
known as home children the philanthropic farm school alone sent more than boys to the colonies between and many of them taken from workhouses
in maria rye and annie macpherson two spinster ladies of strong resolve began taking groups of orphans and children from workhouses to canada most of whom were taken in by farming families in ontario
the canadian government paid a small fee to the ladies for each child delivered but most of the cost was met by charities or the poor law unions
as far as possible elderly inmates were expected to undertake the same kind of work as the younger men and women although concessions were made to their relative frailty
or they might be required to chop firewood clean the wards or carry out other domestic tasks
in lady brabazon later the countess of meath set up a project to provide alternative occupation for non able bodied inmates known as the brabazon scheme
volunteers provided training in crafts such as knitting embroidery and lace making all costs initially being borne by lady brabazon herself
although slow to take off when workhouses discovered that the goods being produced were saleable and could make the enterprise self financing the scheme gradually spread across the country and by there were more than branches
in the poor law commission distributed six diets for workhouse inmates one of which was to be chosen by each poor law union depending on its local circumstances
although dreary the food was generally nutritionally adequate and according to contemporary records was prepared with great care
issues such as training staff to serve and weigh portions were well understood
the diets included general guidance as well as schedules for each class of inmate
they were laid out on a weekly rotation the various meals selected on a daily basis from a list of foodstuffs
for instance a breakfast of bread and gruel was followed by dinner which might consist of cooked meats pickled pork or bacon with vegetables potatoes yeast dumpling soup and suet or rice pudding
supper was normally bread cheese and broth and sometimes butter or potatoes
the larger workhouses had separate dining rooms for males and females workhouses without separate dining rooms would stagger the meal times to avoid any contact between the sexes
education was provided for the children but workhouse teachers were a particular problem
poorly paid without any formal training and facing large classes of unruly children with little or no interest in their lessons few stayed in the job for more than a few months
in an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education legislation was passed in requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers
a training college for workhouse teachers was set up at kneller hall in twickenham during the s but it closed in the following decade
some children were trained in skills valuable to the area
in shrewsbury the boys were placed in the workhouse s workshop while girls were tasked with spinning making gloves and other jobs suited to their sex their ages and abilities
at st martin in the fields children were trained in spinning flax picking hair and carding wool before being placed as apprentices
workhouses also had links with local industry in nottingham children employed in a cotton mill earned about a year for the workhouse
some parishes advertised for apprenticeships and were willing to pay any employer prepared to offer them
such agreements were preferable to supporting children in the workhouse apprenticed children were not subject to inspection by justices thereby lowering the chance of punishment for neglect and apprenticeships were viewed as a better long term method of teaching skills to children who might otherwise be uninterested in work
supporting an apprenticed child was also considerably cheaper than the workhouse or outdoor relief
children often had no say in the matter which could be arranged without the permission or knowledge of their parents
the supply of labour from workhouse to factory which remained popular until the s was sometimes viewed as a form of transportation
while getting parish apprentices from clerkenwell samuel oldknow s agent reported how some parents came crying to beg they may have their children out again
historian arthur redford suggests that the poor may have once shunned factories as an insidious sort of workhouse
religion played an important part in workhouse life prayers were read to the paupers before breakfast and after supper each day
each poor law union was required to appoint a chaplain to look after the spiritual needs of the workhouse inmates and he was invariably expected to be from the established church of england
religious services were generally held in the dining hall as few early workhouses had a separate chapel
but in some parts of the country notably cornwall and northern england there were more dissenters than members of the established church as section of the poor law specifically forbade any regulation forcing an inmate to attend church services in a mode contrary to their religious principles the commissioners were reluctantly forced to allow non anglicans to leave the workhouse on sundays to attend services elsewhere so long as they were able to provide a certificate of attendance signed by the officiating minister on their return
as the th century wore on non conformist ministers increasingly began to conduct services within the workhouse but catholic priests were rarely welcomed
a variety of legislation had been introduced during the th century to limit the civil rights of catholics beginning with the popish recusants act in the wake of the failed gunpowder plot that year
though almost all restrictions on catholics in england and ireland were removed by the roman catholic relief act a great deal of anti catholic feeling remained
even in areas with large catholic populations such as liverpool the appointment of a catholic chaplain was unthinkable
some guardians went so far as to refuse catholic priests entry to the workhouse
discipline was strictly enforced in the workhouse for minor offences such as swearing or feigning sickness the disorderly could have their diet restricted for up to hours
for more serious offences such as insubordination or violent behaviour the refractory could be confined for up to hours and might also have their diet restricted
girls were punished in the same way as adults but sometimes in older cases girls were also beaten or slapped but boys under the age of could be beaten with a rod or other instrument such as may have been approved of by the guardians
the persistently refractory or anyone bringing spirituous or fermented liquor into the workhouse could be taken before a justice of the peace and even jailed
all punishments handed out were recorded in a punishment book which was examined regularly by the workhouse guardians locally elected representatives of the participating parishes with overall responsibility for the running of the workhouse
although the commissioners were responsible for the regulatory framework within which the poor law unions operated each union was run by a locally elected board of guardians comprising representatives from each of the participating parishes assisted by six ex officio members
the guardians were usually farmers or tradesmen and as one of their roles was the contracting out of the supply of goods to the workhouse the position could prove lucrative for them and their friends
simon fowler has commented that it is clear that this the awarding of contracts involved much petty corruption and it was indeed endemic throughout the poor law system
although the act allowed for women to become workhouse guardians provided they met the property requirement the first female was not elected until
working class guardians were not appointed until when the property requirement was dropped in favour of occupying rented premises worth a year
every workhouse had a complement of full time staff often referred to as the indoor staff
at their head was the governor or master who was appointed by the board of guardians
his duties were laid out in a series of orders issued by the poor law commissioners
as well as the overall administration of the workhouse masters were required to discipline the paupers as necessary and to visit each ward twice daily at am and pm
female inmates and children under seven were the responsibility of the matron as was the general housekeeping
the master and the matron were usually a married couple charged with running the workhouse at the minimum cost and maximum efficiency for the lowest possible wages
a large workhouse such as whitechapel accommodating several thousand paupers employed a staff of almost the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse in addition to the master and matron
a typical workhouse accommodating inmates had a staff of five which included a part time chaplain and a part time medical officer
the low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced
to add to their difficulties in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own pockets for any drugs dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients
a second major wave of workhouse construction began in the mid s the result of a damning report by the poor law inspectors on the conditions found in infirmaries in london and the provinces
of one workhouse in southwark london an inspector observed bluntly that the workhouse does not meet the requirements of medical science nor am i able to suggest any arrangements which would in the least enable it to do so
by the middle of the th century there was a growing realisation that the purpose of the workhouse was no longer solely or even chiefly to act as a deterrent to the able bodied poor and the first generation of buildings was widely considered to be inadequate
about new workhouses were built mainly in london lancashire and yorkshire between and in architectural styles that began to adopt italianate or elizabethan features to better fit into their surroundings and present a less intimidating face
one surviving example is the gateway at ripon designed somewhat in the style of a medieval almshouse
a major feature of this new generation of buildings is the long corridors with separate wards leading off for men women and children
by the architectural fashion had moved away from the corridor design in favour of a pavilion style based on the military hospitals built during and after the crimean war providing light and well ventilated accommodation
opened in the manchester union s infirmary comprised seven parallel three storey pavilions separated by foot wide m airing yards each pavilion had space for beds a day room a nurse s kitchen and toilets
by the start of the th century new workhouses were often fitted out to an impressive standard
opened in the workhouse at hunslet in west riding of yorkshire had two steam boilers with automatic stokers supplying heating and hot water throughout the building a generator to provide electricity for the institution s electric lamps and electric lifts in the infirmary pavilion
as early as the poor law commissioners were aware of an insoluble dilemma posed by the ideology behind the new poor law
the education of children presented a similar dilemma
it was provided free in the workhouse but had to be paid for by the merely poor free primary education for all children was not provided in the uk until
instead of being less eligible conditions for those living in the workhouse were in certain respects more eligible than for those living in poverty outside
by the late s most workhouses outside london and the larger provincial towns housed only the incapable elderly and sick
by the end of the century only about per cent of those admitted to workhouses were unemployed or destitute but about per cent of the population over were in workhouses
the introduction of pensions for those aged over in did not reduce the number of elderly housed in workhouses but it did reduce the number of those on outdoor relief by per cent
responsibility for administration of the poor law passed to the local government board in and the emphasis soon shifted from the workhouse as a receptacle for the helpless poor to its role in the care of the sick and helpless
the diseases prevention act of allowed workhouse infirmaries to offer treatment to non paupers as well as inmates and by the beginning of the th century some infirmaries were even able to operate as private hospitals
a royal commission of reported that workhouses were unsuited to deal with the different categories of resident they had traditionally housed and recommended that specialised institutions for each class of pauper should be established in which they could be treated appropriately by properly trained staff
the deterrent workhouses were in future to be reserved for incorrigibles such as drunkards idlers and tramps
on january the daily telegraph reported that the local government committee on the poor law had presented to the ministry of reconstruction a report recommending abolition of the workhouses and transferring their duties to other organizations
the local government act gave local authorities the power to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals although outside london few did so
the workhouse system was abolished in the uk by the same act on april but many workhouses renamed public assistance institutions continued under the control of local county councils
at the outbreak of the second world war in almost people were accommodated in the former workhouses of whom were children
the national assistance act abolished the last vestiges of the poor law and with it the workhouses
many of the workhouse buildings were converted into retirement homes run by the local authorities slightly more than half of local authority accommodation for the elderly was provided in former workhouses in
camberwell workhouse in peckham south london continued until as a homeless shelter for more than men operated by the department of health and social security and renamed a resettlement centre
southwell workhouse now a museum was used to provide temporary accommodation for mothers and children until the early s
the poor law was not designed to address the issue of poverty which was considered to be the inevitable lot for most people rather it was concerned with pauperism the inability of an individual to support himself
writing in patrick colquhoun commented that
historian simon fowler has argued that workhouses were largely designed for a pool of able bodied idlers and shirkers
however this group hardly existed outside the imagination of a generation of political economists
workhouse life was intended to be harsh to deter the able bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply a principle known as less eligibility
friedrich engels however described what he imagined the motives of the authors of the new poor law to be to force the poor into the procrustean bed of their preconceived notions
to do this they treated the poor with incredible savagery
the purpose of workhouse labour was never clear according to historian m
crowther
in the early days of workhouses it was either a punishment or a source of income for the parish but during the th century the idea of work as punishment became increasingly unfashionable
the idea took hold that work should rehabilitate the workhouse inmates for their eventual independence and that it should therefore be rewarded with no more than the workers maintenance otherwise there would be no incentive for them to seek work elsewhere
as of around of the british population had a genealogical connection to the workhouse system
the dramatic possibilities of the workhouse provided the inspiration for several artists including charles west cope whose board day application for bread depicting a young widow pleading for bread for her four children was painted following his visit to a meeting of the staines board of guardians
the quintessential workhouse yarn is oliver twist by charles dickens which contains the well known request from oliver to the master of the workhouse please sir i want some more
another popular piece of workhouse literature was the dramatic monologue in the workhouse christmas day by george robert sims with its first line of it is christmas day in the workhouse
in chapter xxvii of his first book down and out in paris and london george orwell gives a brief but vivid account of his stay in a london workhouse when he roamed the streets as a tramp
