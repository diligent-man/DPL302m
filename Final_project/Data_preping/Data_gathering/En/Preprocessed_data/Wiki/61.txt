the nba draft took place on june at general motors place in vancouver british columbia canada
this draft helped turn around four struggling franchises the dallas mavericks the sacramento kings the boston celtics and the toronto raptors
the vancouver grizzlies and the toronto raptors were not able to win the nba draft lottery as they were expansion teams they were not allowed to select first in this draft
the mavericks despite having a talented nucleus of jason kidd jamal mashburn and jimmy jackson in the mid s had not had a winning season since which was also the last time they made the playoffs
by the end of the season all three players were traded and it was time to rebuild
with the sixth selection in they drafted robert traylor and quickly traded him to the milwaukee bucks for dirk nowitzki and pat garrity
they then traded garrity in a package to the phoenix suns for steve nash
with nash and nowitzki the mavericks quickly went from a lottery team in the late s to a perennial playoff contender throughout the s
nowitzki went on to win the nba finals with dallas without nash but with kidd
meanwhile the raptors were a recent expansion team that had failed to win more than games in its first three seasons
with the fourth pick they selected antawn jamison whom they quickly dealt to the golden state warriors for vince carter
carter went on to win rookie of the year
first overall pick michael olowokandi from mid major university of the pacific is regarded by sports illustrated as one of the biggest draft busts in nba history
as of february he is the last top selection to come out of a university that is considered mid major
five players from the draft class have played in the nba all star game at least once in their careers nowitzki carter jamison paul pierce and rashard lewis
all of them have reached the points plateau during their careers except for lewis
carter retired in making him the last active player drafted in the s to retire
he set the record for most seasons played in the nba with and is the only player to play in decades
nowitzki retired in april and remained with the mavericks for his entire career making him the only person to ever play seasons with one team
these players were not selected in the nba draft but have played at least one game in the nba
