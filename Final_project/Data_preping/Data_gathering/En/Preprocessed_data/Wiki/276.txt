the battle of rorke s drift also known as the defence of rorke s drift was an engagement in the anglo zulu war
the successful british defence of the mission station of rorke s drift under the command of lieutenants john chard of the royal engineers and gonville bromhead th regiment of foot began when a large contingent of zulu warriors broke off from their main force during the final hour of the british defeat at the day long battle of isandlwana on january diverting miles km to attack rorke s drift later that day and continuing into the following day
just over british and colonial troops defended the station against attacks by to zulu warriors
the massive but piecemeal attacks by the zulu on rorke s drift came very close to defeating the much smaller garrison but were consistently repelled
eleven victoria crosses were awarded to the defenders along with a number of other decorations and honours
rorke s drift known as kwajimu jim s land in the zulu language was a mission station of the church of sweden and the former trading post of james rorke a merchant from the eastern cape of irish descent
it was located near a drift or ford on the buffalo mzinyathi river which at the time formed the border between the british colony of natal and the zulu kingdom
on january the british no
centre column under lord chelmsford arrived and encamped at the drift
on january the day after the british ultimatum to the zulus expired the column crossed the river and encamped on the zulu bank
a small force consisting of b company nd battalion th nd warwickshire regiment of foot nd th under lieutenant gonville bromhead was detailed to garrison the post which had been turned into a supply depot and hospital under the overall command of brevet major henry spalding th foot a member of chelmsford s staff
on january after reconnaissance patrolling and building of a track for its wagons chelmsford s column marched to isandlwana approximately miles km to the east leaving behind the small garrison
a large company of the nd rd natal native contingent nnc under captain william stevenson was ordered to remain at the post to strengthen the garrison
this company numbered between and men
captain thomas rainforth s g company of the st th foot was ordered to move up from its station at helpmekaar miles km to the southeast after its own relief arrived to further reinforce the position
later that evening a portion of the no
column under brevet colonel anthony durnford late of the royal engineers arrived at the drift and camped on the zulu bank where it remained through the next day
late on the evening of january durnford was ordered to isandlwana as was a small detachment of no
field company royal engineers commanded by lieutenant john chard which had arrived on the th to repair the pontoons that bridged the buffalo
chard rode ahead of his detachment to isandlwana on the morning of january to clarify his orders but was sent back to rorke s drift with only his wagon and its driver to construct defensive positions for the expected reinforcement company passing durnford s column en route in the opposite direction
sometime around noon on the nd major spalding left the station for helpmekaar to ascertain the whereabouts of rainforth s g company which was now overdue
he left chard in temporary command
chard rode down to the drift itself where the engineers camp was located
soon thereafter two survivors from isandlwana lieutenant gert adendorff of the st rd nnc and a trooper from the natal carbineers arrived bearing the news of the defeat and that a part of the zulu impi was approaching the station
upon hearing this news chard bromhead and another of the station s officers acting assistant commissary james dalton of the commissariat and transport department held a quick meeting to decide the best course of action whether to attempt a retreat to helpmekaar or to defend their current position
dalton pointed out that a small column travelling in open country and burdened with carts full of hospital patients would be easily overtaken and defeated by a numerically superior zulu force and so it was soon agreed that the only acceptable course was to remain and fight
once the british officers decided to stay chard and bromhead directed their men to make preparations to defend the station
with the garrison s odd men working diligently a defensive perimeter was quickly constructed out of mealie bags
this perimeter incorporated the storehouse the hospital and a stout stone kraal
the buildings were fortified with loopholes firing holes knocked through the external walls and the external doors barricaded with furniture
at about p m a mixed troop of about natal native horse nnh under lieutenant alfred henderson arrived at the station after having retreated in good order from isandlwana
they volunteered to picket the far side of the oscarberg shiyane the large hill that overlooked the station and from behind which the zulus were expected to approach
with the defences nearing completion and battle approaching chard had several hundred men available to him bromhead s b company stevenson s large nnc company henderson s nnh troop and various others most of them hospital patients but walking wounded drawn from various british and colonial units
adendorff also stayed while the trooper who had ridden in with him galloped on to warn the garrison at helpmekaar
the force was sufficient in chard s estimation to fend off the zulus
chard posted the british soldiers around the perimeter adding some of the more able patients the casuals and civilians and those of the nnc who possessed firearms along the barricade
the rest of the nnc armed only with spears were posted outside the mealie bag and biscuit box barricade within the stone walled cattle kraal
the approaching zulu force was vastly larger the udloko uthulwana indlondo amabutho regiments of married men aged in their s and s and the indlu yengwe ibutho of young unmarried men mustered to warriors none of them engaged during the battle at isandlwana
this zulu force was the loins or reserve of the army at isandlwana and is often referred to as the undi corps
it was directed to swing wide of the british left flank and pass west and south of isandlwana hill itself in order to position itself across the line of communication and retreat of the british and their colonial allies in order to prevent their escape back into natal by way of the buffalo river ford leading to rorke s drift
by the time the undi corps reached rorke s drift at p m they had fast marched some miles km from the morning encampment they had left at around a m then to spend some hours continuously storming the british fortifications at rorke s drift
most zulu warriors were armed with an assegai short spear and a nguni shield made of cowhide
the zulu army drilled in the personal and tactical use and coordination of this weapon
some zulus also had old muskets antiquated rifles and some captured martini henrys as used by the defenders though their marksmanship training was poor and the supply of powder and shot was low and of poor quality
it has been reported that they believed that setting the slide on the rear sight of the martini henry graduated to yards as high as possible would make the shot more powerful so that they actually fired high
the zulu attitude towards firearms was that the generality of zulu warriors however would not have firearms the arms of a coward as they said for they enable the poltroon to kill the brave without awaiting his attack even though their fire was not accurate it was responsible for five of the british deaths at rorke s drift
while the undi corps had been led by inkhosi kamapitha at the isandlwana battle the command of the undi corps passed to prince dabulamanzi kampande half brother of cetshwayo kampande the zulu king when kamapitha was wounded during the pursuit of british survivors from isandlwana
prince dabulamanzi was considered rash and aggressive and this characterisation was borne out by his violation of king cetshwayo s order to act only in defence of zululand against the invading british soldiers and not carry the war over the border into enemy territory
the rorke s drift attack was an unplanned raid rather than any organised counter invasion with many of the undi corps zulus breaking off to raid other african kraals and homesteads while the main body advanced on rorke s drift
at about p m surgeon james reynolds otto witt the swedish missionary who ran the mission at rorke s drift and army chaplain reverend george smith came down from the oscarberg hillside with the news that a body of zulus was fording the river to the southeast and was no more than five minutes away
at this point witt decided to depart the station as his family lived in an isolated farmhouse about kilometres mi away and he wanted to be with them
witt s native servant umkwelnantaba left with him so too did one of the hospital patients lieutenant thomas purvis of the st rd nnc
at about p m the battle began with lieutenant henderson s nnh troopers stationed behind the oscarberg briefly engaging the vanguard of the main zulu force
however tired from the battle at isandlwana and retreat to rorke s drift as well as being short of carbine ammunition henderson s men departed for helpmekaar
henderson himself reported to lieutenant chard the enemy were close and that his men would not obey his orders but were going off to helpmekaar
henderson then followed his departing men
upon witnessing the withdrawal of henderson s nnh troop captain stevenson s nnc company abandoned the cattle kraal and fled greatly reducing the strength of the defending garrison
outraged that stevenson and some of his colonial ncos also fled from the barricades a few british soldiers fired after them killing corporal william anderson
with the zulus nearly at the station the garrison now numbered between and men
of these only bromhead s company could be considered a cohesive unit
additionally up to of his company were at the station as hospital patients although only a handful of these were unable to take up arms
with fewer men chard realised the need to modify the defences and gave orders that biscuit boxes be used to construct a wall through the middle of the post in order to make possible the abandonment of the hospital side of the station if the need arose
at p m the zulus rounded the oscarberg and approached the south wall
private frederick hitch posted as lookout atop the storehouse reported a large column of zulus approaching
the zulu vanguard men of the indluyengwe attacked the south wall which joined the hospital and the storehouse
the british opened fire when the zulus were yards m away
the majority of the attacking zulu force moved around to attack the north wall while a few took cover and were either pinned down by continuing british fire or retreated to the terraces of oscarberg
there they began a harassing fire of their own
as this occurred another zulu force continued to the hospital and northwestern wall
those british on the barricades including dalton and bromhead were soon engaged in fierce hand to hand fighting
the british wall was too high for the zulus to scale so they resorted to crouching under the wall trying to get hold of the defenders martini henry rifles slashing at british soldiers with assegais or firing their weapons through the wall
at places they clambered over each other s bodies to drive the british off the walls but were driven back
zulu fire both from those under the wall and around the oscarberg inflicted a few casualties and five of the defenders who were killed or mortally wounded in the action were struck while at the north wall
chard realised that the north wall under near constant attack from the zulus could not be held
at p m he pulled his men back into the yard abandoning the front two rooms of the hospital in the process
the hospital was becoming untenable the loopholes had become a liability as rifles poking out were grabbed at by the zulus yet if the holes were left empty the zulu warriors stuck their own weapons through in order to fire into the rooms
among the soldiers assigned to the hospital were corporal william wilson allen and privates cole dunbar hitch horrigan john williams joseph williams alfred henry hook robert jones and william jones
privates horrigan john williams joseph williams and other patients tried to hold the hospital entrance with rifles and fixed bayonets
joseph williams defended a small window and dead zulus were later found beneath that window
as it became clear the front of the building was being taken over by zulus john williams began to hack a way of escape through the wall dividing the central room and a corner room in the back of the hospital
as he made a passable breach the door into the central room came under furious attack from the zulus and he had time only to drag two bedridden patients out before the door gave way
the corner room into which john williams had pulled the two patients was occupied by private hook and another nine patients
john williams hacked at the wall to the next room with his pick axe as hook held off the zulus
a firefight erupted as the zulus fired through the door and hook returned fire an assegai striking his helmet and stunning him
williams made the hole big enough to get into the next room occupied only by patient private waters and dragged the patients through
the last man out was hook who killed some zulus who had knocked down the door before he dived through the hole
john williams once again went to work spurred on by the fact that the roof was now ablaze as hook defended the hole and waters continued to fire through a loophole
after minutes the hole was large enough to drag the patients through and most of the men were now in the last room defended by privates robert jones and william jones
from here the patients clambered out through a window and then made their way across the yard to the barricade
privates waters and beckett hid in the wardrobe waters was wounded and beckett died of assegai wounds
of the patients nine survived the trip to the barricade as did all the able bodied men
according to james henry reynolds four defenders were killed in the hospital one was a member of the natal native contingent with a broken leg sergeant maxfield and private jenkins who were ill with fever and refused to be moved were also killed
reportedly jenkins was killed after being seized and stabbed together with private adams who also refused to move
private cole assigned to the hospital was killed when he ran outside
another hospital patient killed was trooper hunter of the natal mounted police
among the hospital patients who escaped were a corporal mayer of the nnc bombardier lewis of the royal artillery and trooper green of the natal mounted police who was wounded in the thigh by a bullet
private conley with a broken leg was pulled to safety by hook although conley s leg was broken again in the process
the evacuation of the burning hospital completed the shortening of the perimeter
as night fell the zulu attacks grew stronger
the cattle kraal came under renewed assault and was evacuated by p m leaving the remaining men in a small bastion around the storehouse
throughout the night the zulus kept up a constant assault against the british positions zulu attacks began to slacken only after midnight ending by a m and replaced by harassing fire from zulu firearms until a m
by that time the garrison had sustained dead
two more were mortally wounded and eight more including dalton were seriously wounded
almost every man had some kind of wound
they were all exhausted having fought for the better part of hours and were running low on ammunition
of rounds in reserve at the mission only remained
as dawn broke the british could see that the zulus were gone all that remained were the dead and severely wounded
patrols were dispatched to scout the battlefield recover rifles and look for survivors many of whom were killed
when found
at roughly a m an impi of zulus suddenly appeared and the british manned their positions again
no attack materialised however as the zulus had been on the move for six days prior to the battle and had not eaten properly for two
in their ranks were hundreds of wounded and they were several days march from any supplies
soon after their appearance the zulus left the way they had come
around a m another force appeared and the defenders left their breakfast to man their positions again
however the force turned out to be the vanguard of lord chelmsford s relief column

st rd nnc killed in action
nd rd nnc killed woundedafter the battle zulu bodies were counted but it has been estimated that at least wounded and captured zulus might have been massacred as well
having witnessed the carnage at isandlwana the members of chelmsford s relief force had no mercy for the captured wounded zulus they came across nor did the station s defenders
trooper william james clarke of the natal mounted police described in his diary that altogether we buried zulus and some wounded were thrown into the grave
seeing the manner in which our wounded had been mutilated after being dragged from the hospital
we were very bitter and did not spare wounded zulus
laband in his book the zulu response to the british invasion of accepts the estimate of that shepstone had from the zulus
samuel pitt who served as a private in b company during the battle told the western mail in that the official enemy death toll was too low we reckon we had accounted for but the books will tell you or
lieutenant horace smith dorrien a member of chelmsford s staff wrote that the day after the battle an improvised gallows was used for hanging zulus who were supposed to have behaved treacherously
eleven victoria crosses were awarded to the defenders of rorke s drift seven of them to soldiers of the nd th foot the most ever received for a single action by one regiment
the most awarded in a day is for actions at the battle of inkerman on november in a single action were awarded as a result of the second relief of lucknow november
four distinguished conduct medals were also awarded
this high number of awards for bravery has been interpreted as a reaction to the earlier defeat at the battle of isandlwana the extolling of the victory at rorke s drift drawing the public s attention away from the great defeat at isandlwana and the fact that lord chelmsford and henry bartle frere had instigated the war without the approval of her majesty s government
sir garnet wolseley taking over as commander in chief from lord chelmsford later that year was unimpressed with the awards made to the defenders of rorke s drift saying it is monstrous making heroes of those who shut up in buildings at rorke s drift could not bolt and fought like rats for their lives which they could not otherwise save
several historians have challenged this assertion and pointed out that the victory stands on its own merits regardless of other concerns
victor davis hanson responded to it directly in carnage and culture also published as why the west has won saying modern critics suggest such lavishness in commendation was designed to assuage the disaster at isandhlwana and to reassure a skeptical victorian public that the fighting ability of the british soldier remained unquestioned
maybe maybe not but in the long annals of military history it is difficult to find anything quite like rorke s drift where a beleaguered force outnumbered to one survived and killed men for every defender lost

the events surrounding the assault on rorke s drift were first dramatised by military painters notably elizabeth butler in the defence of rorke s drift and alphonse de neuville also titled the defence of rorke s drift
their work was vastly popular in their day among the citizens of the british empire

the film received generally positive reviews from the critics
some details of the film s account are however historically inaccurate for example in the movie the regiment is called the south wales borderers but the unit was not in fact called that until two years after the battle although the regiment had been based at brecon in south wales since
while most of the men of the st battalion th regiment of foot were recruited from the industrial towns and agricultural classes of england principally from birmingham and adjacent southwest counties only soldiers of the that fought in the battle were welsh
