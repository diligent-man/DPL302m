holloway circus also referred to as the holloway circus tower or beetham tower is a foot m tall mixed use skyscraper in birmingham city centre england
it was originally named after the developers beetham organisation and was designed by ian simpson and built by laing o rourke
the entire development covers an area of square feet m
it is the second tallest building in birmingham and the th tallest building in the united kingdom
it has floors and is the third tallest structure in the city after the ft m british telecom tower and the ft m the mercian
the front fa ade of the building is floor to ceiling glass decorated in tiger stripes which are used to enhance the vertical impact
as the apartments were being furbished an aqua coloured camouflage was also added to these windows with some of the tiger stripes being removed
coloured lights can be seen underneath the overhang at night
the lower floors are a radisson blu hotel which opened to guests on january whilst the upper floors were still being furnished
the upper floors contain apartments
there are eight circular concrete columns as well as the core on each floor
the post tensioned flat plates of the upper floors are concrete and measure in mm in thickness
holloway circus received points in the emporis skyscraper awards placing it in eighth position in the top ten
the plans for the development were first revealed in as part of a competition in which designs for a tower acting as a gateway to the city centre were to be submitted to the council and also for a building that could aid the regeneration plans in and around the area
the site chosen was the aeu building designed by the john madin design group and completed in at holloway circus
two serious proposals were put forward one by cala homes which consisted of two cylindrical glass towers and the other by the beetham corporation which was a single storey tower with two spires on the roof producing a total height of feet m
the beetham corporation won however it was forced to scale down the towers height due to height limits enforced after the september terrorist attacks on the world trade center by the civil aviation authority
the spires were also removed and replaced by two cones placed on the rear of the tower on top of the stairwells
the overhang at the front was added
the proposed office space was also removed and the planning application was withdrawn
the new design was submitted however was withdrawn by the beetham corporation after talks over the purchase of the adjacent multi storey car park with national car parks broke down without a deal
this was a surprise to the developers as they had expected to be able to purchase the land and had even included their plans for the site in the previous planning application
amendments to the planning application were made and it was resubmitted in october
the final design was approved by the planning department at birmingham city council with conditions on april after the beetham corporation paid million under section to gain planning approval
a model of the tower was tested in a wind tunnel with models of surrounding buildings also being included
the ground of the model was also accurate to that of the birmingham landscape
the model passed with few problems and construction of the tower began
construction began in march with the erection of hoardings around the site allowing clearance work to commence and the construction of a tower crane
the concrete core then began to rise and reached a considerable height before the construction of the concrete floor panels began
the transportation of materials to the higher levels were done using a lift attached to the middle of the curved frontage
that area was intended to be used as a staircase in the case of an emergency
the building topped out in april
the construction of the building encountered several problems
not far into the construction of the lift shaft a piece of scaffolding became dislodged and fell to the ground causing traffic delays around holloway circus which subsequently resulted in widespread disruption in the city centre
on november pieces of cladding from the higher levels on the sides became detached from the building and fell to the ground
no injuries were caused however fear of more panels falling off caused nearby roads to be closed for an entire weekend until the site could be declared safe by inspectors
clips were later installed to secure the panels and as of mid work was underway to permanently secure the panels in place using new clips
the securing of the panels was completed in late august
the beetham corporation could now face legal action due to the structure causing road closures and subsequent congestion
excluding the problems with the panel clips construction of the floors took ten months
concrete was the primary material in the construction of the structure
the beetham organisation again faced legal action over claims by people who signed contracts to buy flats before the tower was completed that the flats they received did not match those described in the sales literature
as a result of technical problems within the underground car park resident s cars were trapped for three days
cars are placed on a platform and are taken into a space by a computer when the owner s card is swiped however glitches meant that people who had purchased spaces within the park either could not get access to their cars or were unable to enter the car park in their vehicles
holloway circus faced yet more problems when on july a glass panel shattered and sent pieces raining feet m onto the ground
the ft m by ft m panel on the eighth floor of beetham tower is believed to have shattered due to a build up of chemical compounds inside the glass
splinters fell onto the car park roof and smallbrook queensway at about am
it was the third safety incident at the tower in three years
