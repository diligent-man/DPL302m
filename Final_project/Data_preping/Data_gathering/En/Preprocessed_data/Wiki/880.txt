the orly bombing came five days before the second armenian world congress was due to open at lausanne

under the terms of the deal asala members supposedly were also granted unrestricted use of french airports and four asala members charged with the takeover of the turkish consulate in paris in which a security guard was killed were given light sentences seven years in jail
garabedian told french investigators that the violation of the secret pact by asala was an accident and that the suitcase bomb was supposed to detonate on board the turkish airliner not on french soil
