wuxia u ja which literally means martial heroes is a genre of chinese fiction concerning the adventures of martial artists in ancient china
although wuxia is traditionally a form of fantasy literature its popularity has caused it to be adapted for such diverse art forms as chinese opera manhua television dramas films and video games
it forms part of popular culture in many chinese speaking communities around the world
the word w xi is a compound composed of the elements w literally martial military or armed and xi literally chivalrous vigilante or hero
a martial artist who follows the code of xia is often referred to as a xi k literally follower of xia or y uxi literally wandering xia
in some translations the martial artist is referred to as a swordsman or swordswoman even though they may not necessarily wield a sword
the heroes in wuxia fiction typically do not serve a lord wield military power or belong to the aristocratic class
they often originate from the lower social classes of ancient chinese society
a code of chivalry usually requires wuxia heroes to right and redress wrongs fight for righteousness remove oppressors and bring retribution for past misdeeds
chinese xia traditions can be compared to martial codes from other cultures such as the japanese samurai bushid
even though the term wuxia as the name of a genre is a recent coinage stories about xia date back more than years
wuxia stories have their roots in some early youxia tales from bce
the legalist philosopher han fei spoke disparagingly of youxias in his book han feizi in the chapter on five maggot classes about five social classes in the spring and autumn period
some well known stories include zhuan zhu s assassination of king liao of wu and most notably jing ke s attempt on the life of the king of qin who later became qin shi huang
in volume of the records of the grand historian shi ji sima qian mentioned five notable assassins cao mo zhuan zhu yu rang nie zheng and jing ke in the warring states period who undertook tasks of conducting political assassinations of aristocrats and nobles
these assassins were known as cike literally stabbing guests
they usually rendered their loyalties and services to feudal lords and nobles in return for rewards such as riches and women
in volume of the shi ji sima qian detailed several embryonic features of xia culture from his period
these popular phenomena were also documented in other historical records such as the book of han and the book of the later han
xiake stories made a turning point in the tang dynasty and returned in the form of chuanqi literally legendary tales
stories from that era such as nie yinniang the kunlun slave thirteenth madame jing red string and the bearded warrior served as prototypes for modern wuxia stories
they featured fantasies and isolated protagonists usually loners who performed daring heroic deeds
during the song dynasty similar stories circulated in the huaben short works that were once thought to have served as prompt books for shuochang traditional chinese storytelling
the genre of the martial or military romance also developed during the tang dynasty
in the ming dynasty luo guanzhong and shi nai an wrote romance of the three kingdoms and water margin respectively which are among the great classical novels of chinese literature
the former is a romanticised historical retelling of the events in the late eastern han dynasty and the three kingdoms period while the latter criticises the deplorable socio economic status of the late northern song dynasty
water margin is often seen as the first full length wuxia novel the portrayal of the heroes and their code of honour and willingness to become outlaws rather than serve a corrupt government played an influential role in the development of jianghu culture in later centuries
romance of the three kingdoms is also seen as a possible early antecedent and contains classic close combat descriptions that were later emulated by wuxia writers in their works
in the qing dynasty further developments were the gong an literally public case and related detective novels where xia and other heroes in collaboration with a judge or magistrate solved crimes and battled injustice
the justice bao stories from sanxia wuyi later extended and renamed to qixia wuyi and xiaowuyi incorporated much of social justice themes of later wuxia stories
xiayi stories of chivalrous romance which frequently featured female heroes and supernatural fighting abilities also surfaced during the qing dynasty
novels such as shi gong an qiwen and ern yingxiong zhuan have been cited as the clearest nascent wuxia novels
the term wuxia as a genre label itself first appeared at the end of the qing dynasty a calque of the japanese buky a genre of oft militaristic and bushido influenced adventure fiction
the term was brought to china by writers and students who hoped that china would modernise its military and place emphasis on martial virtues and it quickly became entrenched as the term used to refer to xiayi and other predecessors of wuxia proper
in japan however the term buky faded into obscurity
many wuxia works produced during the ming and qing dynasties were lost due to the governments crackdown on and banning of such works
wuxia works were deemed responsible for brewing anti government sentiments which led to rebellions in those eras
the departure from mainstream literature also meant that patronage of this genre was limited to the masses and not to the literati which led to the stifling of the development of the wuxia genre
nonetheless the wuxia genre remained enormously popular with the common people
the modern wuxia genre rose to prominence in the early th century after the may fourth movement of
a new literature evolved calling for a break with confucian values and the xia emerged as a symbol of personal freedom defiance to confucian tradition and rejection of the chinese family system
xiang kairan pen name pingjiang buxiaosheng became the first notable wuxia writer with his debut novel being the peculiar knights errant of the jianghu
it was serialised from and was adapted into the first wuxia film the burning of the red lotus temple
zhao huanting who wrote chronicles of the loyal knights errant serialised was another well known wuxia writer based in shanghai
starting from the s wuxia works proliferated and its centre shifted to beijing and tianjin in northern china
the most prolific writers there were collectively referred to as the five great masters of the northern school huanzhulouzhu who wrote the swordspeople from shu mountains gong baiyu who wrote twelve coin darts wang dulu who wrote the crane iron pentalogy zheng zhengyin who wrote the king of eagle claws zhu zhenmu who wrote the seven kill stele
wuxia fiction was banned at various times during the republican era and these restrictions stifled the growth of the genre
in spite of this wuxia writing prevailed in other chinese speaking regions such as taiwan and hong kong
between the s and s the genre entered a golden age
writers such as liang yusheng and louis cha jin yong spearheaded the founding of a new school of the wuxia genre that differed largely from its predecessors
they wrote serials for newspapers and magazines
they also incorporated several fictional themes such as mystery and romance from other cultures
in taiwan wolong sheng sima ling zhuge qingyun shiao yi and gu long became the region s best known wuxia writers
after them writers such as woon swee oan and huang yi rose to prominence in a later period
chen yu hui is a contemporary female wuxia novelist who made her debut with the novel the tian guan duo heroes
there have also been works created after the s which attempt to create a post wuxia genre
yu hua one of the more notable writers from this period published a counter genre short story titled blood and plum blossoms in which the protagonist goes on a quest to avenge his murdered father
modern wuxia stories are largely set in ancient or pre modern china
the historical setting can range from being quite specific and important to the story to being vaguely defined anachronistic or mainly for use as a backdrop
elements of fantasy such as the use of magic powers and appearance of supernatural beings are common in some wuxia stories but are not a prerequisite of the wuxia genre
however the martial arts element is a definite part of a wuxia tale as the characters must know some form of martial arts
themes of romance are also strongly featured in some wuxia tales
a typical wuxia story features a young male protagonist who experiences a tragedy such as the loss of his loved ones and goes on to undertake several trials and tribulations to learn several forms of martial arts from various fighters
at the end of the story he emerges as a powerful fighter whom few can equal
he uses his abilities to follow the code of xia and mends the ills of the jianghu
for instance the opening chapters of some of jin yong s works follow a certain pattern a tragic event occurs usually one that costs the lives of the newly introduced characters and then it sets events into motion that will culminate in the primary action of the story
other stories use different structures
for instance the protagonist is denied admission into a martial arts sect
he experiences hardships and trains secretly and waits until there is an opportunity for him to show off his skills and surprise those who initially looked down on him
some stories feature a mature hero with powerful martial arts abilities confronting an equally powerful antagonist as his nemesis
the plot will gradually meander to a final dramatic showdown between the protagonist and his nemesis
these types of stories were prevalent during the era of anti qing revolutionaries
certain stories have unique plots such as those by gu long and huang yi
gu long s works have an element of mystery and are written like detective stories
the protagonist usually a formidable martial artist and intelligent problem solver embarks on a quest to solve a mystery such as a murder case
huang yi s stories are blended with science fiction
despite these genre blending elements wuxia is primarily a historical genre of fiction
notwithstanding this wuxia writers openly admit that they are unable to capture the entire history of a course of events and instead choose to structure their stories along the pattern of the protagonist s progression from childhood to adulthood instead
the progression may be symbolic rather than literal as observed in jin yong s the smiling proud wanderer where linghu chong progresses from childish concerns and dalliances into much more adult ones as his unwavering loyalty repeatedly thrusts him into the rocks of betrayal at the hands of his inhumane master
the eight common attributes of the xia are listed as benevolence justice individualism loyalty courage truthfulness disregard for wealth and desire for glory
apart from individualism these characteristics are similar to confucian values such as ren benevolence kindness zhong loyalty yong courage bravery and yi righteousness
the code of xia also emphasises the importance of repaying benefactors after having received deeds of en grace favour from others as well as seeking chou vengeance revenge to bring villains to justice
however the importance of vengeance is controversial as a number of wuxia works stress buddhist ideals which include forgiveness compassion and a prohibition on killing
in the jianghu martial artists are expected to be loyal to their master shifu
this gives rise to the formation of several complex trees of master apprentice relations as well as the various sects such as shaolin and wudang
if there are any disputes between fighters they will choose the honourable way of settling their issues through fighting in duels
the martial arts in wuxia stories are based on wushu techniques and other real life chinese martial arts
in wuxia tales however the mastery of such skills are highly exaggerated to superhuman levels of achievement and prowess
the following is a list of skills and abilities a typical fighter in a wuxia story possesses
martial arts fighting techniques in a codified sequence called zhaoshi which are based on real life chinese martial arts
weapons and objects combatants use a wide range of weapons in combat
the most commonly used ones are the dao broadsword or saber jian sword gun staff and qiang spear
everyday objects such as abaci benches fans ink brushes smoking pipes sewing needles or various musical instruments are also used as weapons as well
qinggong a form of real chinese martial arts
in wuxia fiction however its use is exaggerated to the point that characters can circumvent gravity to fly cover tremendous distances in a single stride run across surfaces of water mount trees and jump over or scale high walls
neili lit internal force or internal strength neigong literally internal skill or internal function the ability to build up and cultivate inner energy known as qi and utilise it for attack and defensive purposes
characters use this energy to attain skills such as superhuman strength speed stamina durability and healing as well as the ability to project energy beams and elemental forces from their bodies
dianxue literally touching acupuncture points characters use various acupuncture techniques to kill paralyse immobilise or even manipulate opponents by attacking their acupressure points with their bare hands or weapons
such techniques can also be used for healing purposes such as halting excessive bleeding
real life martial artists do use such techniques to paralyse or stun their opponents however their effectiveness is highly exaggerated in wuxia stories in wuxia stories characters attain the above skills and abilities by devoting themselves to years of diligent study and exercise but can also have such power conferred upon them by a master who transfers his energy to them
the instructions to mastering these skills through training are found in secret manuals known as miji
in some stories specific skills can be learned by spending several years in seclusion with a master or training with a group of fighters
