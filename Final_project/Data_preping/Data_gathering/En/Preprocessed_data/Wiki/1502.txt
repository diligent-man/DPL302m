monaco has participated in the eurovision song contest times since its debut in
the country s only win in the contest came in when s verine performed un banc un arbre une rue
as a result monaco was expected to host the contest in but declined
as of monaco is the only microstate which has won the contest
monaco finished last at its first contest in before achieving three top three results in the s
two of these were achieved by fran ois deguelt who finished third in and second in
romuald also finished third in
severine s victory in was the first of five top four results in eight years
the others were achieved by romuald who returned to place fourth in mary christy who was third in mich le torr fourth in and caline and olivier toussaint who were fourth in
after participating in monaco was absent from the contest for years
monaco is the only country to have internally selected all of their participants
while some countries organise televised national finals it is believed that tmc does not have enough funding to organise national finals
monaco returned to the contest for three years from to but failed to qualify for the final on all three occasions
the monegasque broadcaster then withdrew from the contest stating that regional voting patterns in the contest have effectively given monaco no chance of qualifying for the final
monaco participated in the contest times between its debut in and
afterwards the country withdrew from the contest for financial reasons and lack of interest
it only returned in years after its last participation
it withdrew again in after failing to qualify for the final for three consecutive years
monaco won the contest in with the song un banc un arbre une rue performed by s verine
the monegasque victory is rather particular in the history of eurovision as neither the songwriter the singer nor director were from the country they represented something which also was the case with four of luxembourg s five victories
s verine even declared to journalists that she had never set foot in monaco forgetting that the video clip was filmed there
s verine s producer was dishonest with her and stole her prize thus she never got paid for her victory even after suing him
nevertheless the singer is still a great fan of the contest
monaco s next best placing is second place which it has achieved once in
it has placed third three times in and and last twice in and
monaco is among the eight countries which finished last on their first participation the others being austria portugal malta turkey lithuania the czech republic and san marino
monaco is the only country that has won the contest but has never organised it
after winning in the country decided to organise the contest as an open air show setting the date in june rather than early spring
however because of a lack of funds and material t l monte carlo sought help from the french public broadcaster ortf which accepted to organise the contest
because tmc wanted the show to be held in monaco while ortf wanted it in france negotiations never succeeded
monaco left it up to the ebu
the ebu asked spain and germany who respectively finished second and third at the contest but the countries were not interested in organising the contest
it was eventually organised by the bbc in edinburgh
monaco was absent from the contest between and before returning for three years from
during their three year return all the artists representing the country maryon lise darly and s verine ferrer failed to qualify to the finals
tmc did broadcast the contest making the country eligible to participate in the eurovision song contest but tmc decided against it
tmc had announced that it was possible monaco would return to the contest in after a two year absence following talks with the european broadcasting union ebu as well as new voting measures implemented in the contest that year
despite this monaco did not compete in moscow in
the ebu announced they would work harder to bring monaco back into the contest in alongside other lapsed participants
former head of the mon gasque delegation philippe boscagli has accused certain countries of geopolitical voting alleging the existence of eastern european nordic and old european voting blocs henceforth hindering monaco s chances for qualification
with regards to the non qualification of the mon gasque entry in la coco dance he claimed that the audience voted more for the show than the song
furthermore tmc is now part of the tf group the leading private broadcaster in france and is now available everywhere in france
tmc programs no longer revolve around the principality
as tf group being the biggest competitor to the french public channels it is very unlikely that tmc will again broadcast the contest
when tmc did so between and its audience was much smaller than the one of the french public channel
in those years it was the government and the municipality of monaco who chose the contestant and funded the delegation while it is usually the responsibility of a broadcaster or a producer
on november l observateur de monaco reported that euros have been allocated towards initiating the application of the principality to the eurovision competition in the state budget for
monaco s potential return to the contest would have required co operation between the mon gasque government and broadcaster tmc which is owned by france s tf group however in december the mon gasque government announced the launch of a new national public broadcaster monte carlo riviera which will be fully owned by the government opening up a possibility of monaco returning to the contest under the sponsorship of the monegasque government starting in
however the launch of monte carlo riviera was later delayed to between june and september meaning monaco will not be able to return to the contest until at least
due to the country s very small size all monaco s entrants came from outside the principality although french born minouche barelli who represented the principality in shared her time between paris and monaco acquired monegasque citizenship in and died in the principality on february at the age of
the large majority of the participant were french with also one yugoslavian tereza kesovija and one luxembourgian mary christy born marie ruggeri
several singers selected to represent monaco are key figures of the french scene such as fran oise hardy and mich le torr
luxembourg another small country also sent a great number of french artists to the contest
at the contest the monegasque entry boum badaboum sung by minouche barelli was written by serge gainsbourg
he had already composed the winning entry in poup e de cire poup e de son sung by france gall for luxembourg
jean jacques who represented monaco in was the first child to take part in eurovision
he was years old making him the first preteen to participate and the first participant to be born after the inauguration of the contest
a contained phrases in english and german from to monaco did not have its own commentators in the festival t l monte carlo used french commentary instead rtf and ortf
from until and between and tmc did broadcast the contest with its own commentators but they were french
as tmc had been available in the south east of france since the s and by digital terrestrial television throughout the country since french audience was able to watch the eurovision song contest on both france and tmc in and the semi final of only on tmc though
