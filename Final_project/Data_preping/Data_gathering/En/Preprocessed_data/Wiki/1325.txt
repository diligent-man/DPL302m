voltage regulator module vrm sometimes called processor power module ppm buck converter provides microprocessor chipset appropriate supply voltage converting v v v lower voltage required device allowing device different supply voltage mounted motherboard
personal computer pc system vrm typically made power mosfet devices
processor intel haswell ice lake cpu feature voltage regulation component cpu package reduce vrm design motherboard design brings certain level simplification complex voltage regulation involving numerous cpu supply voltage dynamic powering various area cpu
voltage regulator integrated on-package on-die usually referred fully integrated voltage regulator fivr simply integrated voltage regulator ivr
modern cpu require le v cpu designer tend use lower cpu core voltage lower voltage help reducing cpu power dissipation often specified thermal design power tdp serf nominal value designing cpu cooling systems
voltage regulator provide fixed supply voltage processor sense required supply voltage processor essentially acting continuously-variable adjustable regulator
particular vrms soldered motherboard supposed sensing according intel specification
modern video card also use vrm due higher power current requirements
vrms may generate significant amount heat require heat sink separate gpu
correct supply voltage communicated microprocessor vrm startup via number bit called vid voltage identification definition
particular vrm initially provides standard supply voltage vid logic part processor whose aim send vid vrm
vrm ha received vid identifying required supply voltage start acting voltage regulator providing required constant voltage supply processor
instead power supply unit generate fixed voltage cpu us small set digital signal vid line instruct on-board power converter desired voltage level
flexibility obtained make possible use power supply unit cpu different nominal supply voltage reduce power consumption idle period lowering supply voltage
example unit bit vid would output one distinct output voltages
voltage usually always evenly spaced within given range
code word may reserved special function shutting unit hence bit vid unit may fewer output voltage levels
numerical code map supply voltage typically specified table provided component manufacturers
since vid come bit variety mostly applied power module outputting v v
overclocked processor exhibit noticeable performance difference paired different vrms
chip pushed past factory setting increase power draw vrm need match output accordingly
