a voltage regulator module vrm sometimes called processor power module ppm is a buck converter that provides microprocessor and chipset the appropriate supply voltage converting v v or v to lower voltages required by the devices allowing devices with different supply voltages be mounted on the same motherboard
on personal computer pc systems the vrm is typically made up of power mosfet devices
most voltage regulator module implementations are soldered onto the motherboard
some processors such as intel haswell and ice lake cpus feature some voltage regulation components on the same cpu package reduce the vrm design of the motherboard such a design brings certain levels of simplification to complex voltage regulation involving numerous cpu supply voltages and dynamic powering up and down of various areas of a cpu
a voltage regulator integrated on package or on die is usually referred to as fully integrated voltage regulator fivr or simply an integrated voltage regulator ivr
most modern cpus require less than v as cpu designers tend to use lower cpu core voltages lower voltages help in reducing cpu power dissipation which is often specified through thermal design power tdp that serves as the nominal value for designing cpu cooling systems
some voltage regulators provide a fixed supply voltage to the processor but most of them sense the required supply voltage from the processor essentially acting as a continuously variable adjustable regulator
in particular vrms that are soldered to the motherboard are supposed to do the sensing according to the intel specification
modern video cards also use a vrm due to higher power and current requirements
these vrms may generate a significant amount of heat and require heat sinks separate from the gpu
the correct supply voltage is communicated by the microprocessor to the vrm at startup via a number of bits called vid voltage identification definition
in particular the vrm initially provides a standard supply voltage to the vid logic which is the part of the processor whose only aim is to then send the vid to the vrm
when the vrm has received the vid identifying the required supply voltage it starts acting as a voltage regulator providing the required constant voltage supply to the processor
instead of having a power supply unit generate some fixed voltage the cpu uses a small set of digital signals the vid lines to instruct an on board power converter of the desired voltage level
the switch mode buck converter then adjusts its output accordingly
the flexibility so obtained makes it possible to use the same power supply unit for cpus with different nominal supply voltages and to reduce power consumption during idle periods by lowering the supply voltage
for example a unit with bit vid would output one of at most distinct output voltages
these voltages are usually but not always evenly spaced within a given range
some of the code words may be reserved for special functions such as shutting down the unit hence a bit vid unit may have fewer than output voltage levels
how the numerical codes map to supply voltages is typically specified in tables provided by component manufacturers
since vid comes in and bit varieties and is mostly applied to power modules outputting between v and v
the vrms are essential for overclocking
the quality of a vrm directly impacts the motherboard s overclocking potential
the same overclocked processor can exhibit noticeable performance differences when paired with different vrms
the reason for this is that a steady power supply is needed for successful overclocking
when a chip is pushed past its factory settings that increases the power draw so the vrm needs to match its output accordingly
