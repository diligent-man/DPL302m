guangxu emperor august november personal name zaitian was the tenth emperor of the qing dynasty and the ninth qing emperor to rule over china proper
his reign lasted from to but in practice he ruled without empress dowager cixi s influence only from to
he initiated the hundred days reform but was abruptly stopped when the empress dowager launched a coup in after which he became powerless and was held under house arrest until his death
his era name guangxu means glorious succession
the emperor died in and it was widely suspected at the time that he had been poisoned
a forensic examination on his remains confirmed in that the cause of death was arsenic poisoning
the level of arsenic in his remains was times higher than normal
zaitian was the second son of yixuan prince chun and his primary spouse yehenara wanzhen a younger sister of empress dowager cixi
on january zaitian s cousin the tongzhi emperor died without a son to succeed him
breaking the imperial convention that a new emperor must always be of a generation after that of the previous emperor candidates were considered from the generation of the tongzhi emperor
empress dowager ci an suggested choosing one of prince gong s sons to be the next emperor but was overruled by her co regent empress dowager cixi
instead cixi nominated zaitian her nephew and the imperial clan eventually agreed with her choice because zaitian was younger than other adoptable children of the same generation
zaitian was named heir and successor to his late uncle the xianfeng emperor rather than his cousin and predecessor the tongzhi emperor so as to maintain the father son succession law
he ascended to the throne at the age of four and adopted guangxu as his regnal name therefore he is known as the guangxu emperor
he was adopted by empress dowager cixi and ci an
cixi remained as regent under the title holy mother empress dowager while her co regent empress dowager ci an was called mother empress empress dowager
beginning in the guangxu emperor was taught by weng tonghe who had also been involved in the disastrous upbringing of the tongzhi emperor yet somehow managed to be exonerated of all possible charges
weng instilled in the guangxu emperor a duty of filial piety toward the empress dowagers cixi and ci an
in when the guangxu emperor was nine empress dowager ci an died unexpectedly leaving empress dowager cixi as sole regent for the boy
in weng s diaries during those days guangxu was reportedly seen with swollen eyes had poor concentration and was seeking consolation from weng
weng too expressed his concern that cixi was the one who had been suffering from chronic ill health not ci an
during this time the imperial eunuchs often abused their influence over the boy emperor
the guangxu emperor had also reportedly begun to hold some audiences on his own as an act of necessity
in the guangxu emperor was old enough to begin to rule in his own right but the previous year several courtiers including prince chun and weng tonghe had petitioned empress dowager cixi to postpone her retirement from the regency
despite cixi s agreement to remain as regent by the guangxu emperor had begun to write comments on memorials to the throne
in the spring of he partook in his first field plowing ceremony and by the end of the year he had begun to rule under cixi s supervision
eventually in february in preparation for cixi s retirement the guangxu emperor was married
much to the emperor s dislike cixi selected her niece jingfen to be empress
she became known as empress longyu
she also selected a pair of sisters who became consorts jin and zhen to be the emperor s concubines
the following week with the guangxu emperor married cixi retired from the regency
even after the guangxu emperor began formal rule empress dowager cixi continued to influence his decisions and actions despite residing several months of the year at the summer palace
weng tonghe reportedly observed that while the emperor attended to day to day state affairs in more difficult cases the emperor and the grand council sought cixi s advice
in fact the emperor often journeyed to the summer palace to pay his respects to his aunt and to discuss state affairs with her
in march the guangxu emperor received the foreign ministers to china at an audience in the pavilion of purple light in what is now part of zhongnanhai something that had also been done by the tongzhi emperor in
that summer under pressure from the foreign legations and in response to revolts in the yangtze river valley that were targeting christian missionaries the emperor issued an edict ordering christians to be placed under state protection
the guangxu emperor while growing up apparently had been instilled with the importance of frugality
in he tried to implement a series of draconian measures to reduce expenditures by the imperial household department which proved to be one of his few administrative successes
but it was only a partial victory as he had to approve higher expenditures than he would have liked to meet cixi s needs
saw the outbreak of the first sino japanese war
during the war even though the guangxu emperor was nominally the sovereign ruler of the qing empire officials often ignored him and instead sent their memorials to cixi for her approval
eventually two sets of grand council memoranda were created one for the emperor and the other for the empress dowager a practice that continued until it was rendered unnecessary by the events in the autumn of
following the qing empire s defeat and forced agreement to the terms of the treaty of shimonoseki the guangxu emperor reportedly expressed his wish to abdicate
the emperor and the qing government faced further humiliation in late when the german empire used the murders of two priests in shandong province as an excuse to occupy jiaozhou bay prompting a scramble for concessions by other foreign powers
following the war and the scramble for concessions the guangxu emperor came to believe that by learning from constitutional monarchies like japan the qing empire would become more politically and economically powerful
in june the emperor began the hundred days reform aimed at a series of sweeping political legal and social changes
for a brief time after cixi s supposed retirement the guangxu emperor issued edicts for a massive number of far reaching modernizing reforms with the help of more progressive officials such as kang youwei and liang qichao
changes ranged from infrastructure to industry and the civil examination system
the guangxu emperor issued decrees allowing the establishment of a modern university in beijing the construction of the lu han railway and a system of budgets similar to that of western governments
the initial goal was to make china a modern constitutional empire but still within the traditional framework as with japan s meiji restoration
the reforms however were not only too sudden for a china still under significant neo confucian influence and other elements of traditional culture but also came into conflict with cixi who held real power
many officials deemed useless and dismissed by the guangxu emperor begged her for help
although cixi did nothing to stop the hundred days reform from taking place she knew the only way to secure her power base was to stage a military coup
the guangxu emperor became aware of such a plan so he asked kang youwei and his reformist allies to plan his rescue
they decided to use the help of yuan shikai who had a modernized army albeit only strong
cixi relied on ronglu s army in tianjin
ronglu also had an ally general dong fuxiang who commanded muslim kansu braves including generals such as ma fuxiang and ma fulu stationed in the beijing metropolitan area
armed with more advanced firearms and artillery they sided with cixi s conservative faction during the coup
the day before the staged coup was supposed to take place yuan shikai revealed everything to ronglu exposing the guangxu emperor s plans
this gained yuan shikai the trust of cixi as well as the status of lifetime enemy of the guangxu emperor as well as the emperor s younger half brother zaifeng
following the exposure of the plot the emperor and empress dowager met and the emperor retreated to the yingtai pavilion a palace on a lake that is now part of the zhongnanhai compound
lei chia sheng a taiwanese history professor proposes an alternative view that the guangxu emperor might have been led into a trap by the reformists led by kang youwei who in turn was in lei s opinion tricked by british missionary timothy richard and former japanese prime minister it hirobumi into agreeing to appoint it as one of many foreign advisors
british ambassador claude macdonald claimed that the reformists had actually much injured the modernization of china
lei claims that cixi learned of the plot and decided to put an end to it to prevent china from coming under foreign control
the guangxu emperor s duties after became rather limited
the emperor was effectively removed from power as emperor despite keeping the title but he did retain some status
the emperor was kept informed of state affairs reading them with cixi prior to audiences and was also present at audiences sitting on a stool to cixi s left hand while cixi occupied the main throne
he discharged his ceremonial duties such as offering sacrifices during ceremonies but never ruled alone again
in shortly after the collapse of the hundred days reform the guangxu emperor s health began to decline prompting cixi to name pujun a son of the emperor s cousin the reactionary prince duan as heir presumptive
pujun and his father were removed from their positions after the boxer rebellion
he was examined by a physician at the french legation and diagnosed with chronic nephritis he was also discovered to be impotent at the time
during the boxer rebellion emperor guangxu fiercely opposed the idea of using usurpers as a means to counter foreign invasion
his letter to then united states president theodore roosevelt is still preserved in u s
government archives
on august the guangxu emperor along with cixi empress longyu and some other court officials fled from beijing as the forces of the eight nation alliance marched on the capital to relieve the legations that had been besieged during the boxer rebellion
returning to the capital in january after the withdrawal of the foreign powers the guangxu emperor spent the next few years working in his isolated palace with watches and clocks which had been a childhood fascination some say in an effort to pass the time until cixi s death
he also read widely and spent time learning english from cixi s western educated lady in waiting yu deling
his relationship with empress longyu cixi s niece and the emperor s own first cousin also improved to some extent
the guangxu emperor died on november a day before cixi s death at the age of
for a long time there were several theories about the emperor s death none of which was accepted fully by historians
most were inclined to believe that cixi herself very ill poisoned the guangxu emperor because she was afraid he would reverse her policies after her death
china daily quoted a historian dai yi who speculated that cixi might have known of her imminent death and worried that the guangxu emperor would continue his reforms after her death
another theory is that the guangxu emperor was poisoned by yuan shikai who knew that if the emperor were to come to power again yuan would likely be executed for treason
there were no reliable sources to prove who murdered the guangxu emperor
in cixi s former eunuch li lianying was murdered possibly by yuan implying that they had conspired in the emperor s murder
this theory was offered by puyi in his biography he claimed he heard it from an old eunuch
the medical records kept by the guangxu emperor s physician show the emperor suffered from spells of violent stomachaches and that his face had turned blue typical symptoms of arsenic poisoning
to dispel persistent rumors that the emperor had been poisoned the qing imperial court produced documents and doctors records suggesting that the guangxu emperor died from natural causes but these did not allay suspicion
on november forensic tests revealed that the level of arsenic in the emperor s remains was times higher than that of ordinary people
scientists concluded that the poison could only have been administered in a high dose at one time
the guangxu emperor was succeeded by cixi s choice as heir his nephew puyi who took the regnal name xuantong
in january the guangxu emperor s consort who had become empress dowager longyu placed her seal on the abdication decree ending two thousand years of imperial rule in china
longyu died childless in
after the xinhai revolution of the chinese republic funded the construction of the guangxu emperor s mausoleum in the western qing tombs
the tomb was robbed during the chinese civil war and the underground palace burial chamber is now open to the public
in sun yat sen praised the guangxu emperor for his educational reform package that allowed china to learn more about western culture
after the establishment of the people s republic of china in historian fan wenlan called the guangxu emperor a manchu noble who could accept western ideas
some historians believe that the guangxu emperor was the first chinese leader to implement modernizing reforms and capitalism
imperial power in the qing dynasty saw its nadir under guangxu and he was the only qing emperor to have been put under house arrest during his own reign

the emperor was forced by empress dowager cixi to marry her niece his cousin jingfen who was two years his senior
jingfen s father guixiang cixi s younger brother and cixi selected her to be the guangxu emperor s empress consort in order to strengthen the power of her own family
after the marriage jingfen was made empress and was granted the honorific title of longyu meaning auspicious and prosperous chinese after the death of her husband
