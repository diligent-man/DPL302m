Fuchs is credited with introducing the relative poverty rate calculated as the fraction of members of a society earning less than of the median income
In Fuchs published a paper together with James S Hahn entitled How Does Canada Do it A comparison of Expenditures for Physicians' Services in the United States and Canada It discusses the differences in the Canadian and US healthcare spending patterns and also discusses why healthcare expenditures are so much higher in the United States Fuchs and Hahn found that the higher US expenditures were entirely based on percent higher fees for services than Canada even though there are more physicians per capita in Canada That shows that the typical view of Canada saving money by delivering fewer services is false and that the insurance setup being a single payer system is what gives it the edge
Differences between the United States and Canada on fees spending and use are shown The accentuating difference begins with the disparity in health care coverage Canada operates under a universal health care system which covers majority of their residents On the other hand the United States operates under a fragmented multi payer system that fails to provide coverage for many Americans Moreover the lack of correspondence between both countries regarding health care coverage validates part of the narrative reported in the study which concluded that the US spent more on physicians' services than Canada
Furthermore the study also suggests that higher expenditures in the US is a function of many factors including higher wages earned by US physicians the difference of physicians on demand billing costs quality of health care physicians' workload and superfluous amenities Notably the factors bring to question the underlying differences in health care delivery and the authors reported more general practitioners in Canada per capita The limited role of general practitioners in the US compared to Canada may imply that Canadian physicians are more inclined to recommend additional evaluation and management services
