dentistry also known as dental medicine and oral medicine is a branch of medicine that consists of the study diagnosis prevention and treatment of diseases disorders and conditions of the oral cavity the mouth commonly in the dentition development and arrangement of teeth as well as the oral mucosa and of adjacent and related structures and tissues particularly in associated maxillofacial jaw and facial area
the field of dentistry or dental medicine includes teeth as well as other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint and other supporting muscular lymphatic nervous vascular and anatomical structures
the practitioner is called a dentist
dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions
for instance in australia stomatology is considered to be a specialty of dentistry
however some specialties such as oral and maxillofacial surgery facial reconstruction may require both medical and dental degrees to accomplish
dentistry and some branches of medicine in european history were considered to have stemmed from the trade of barber surgeons
however both fields have evolved since with a heavier emphasis in life sciences evidence based research and evidence based practice
dental treatments are carried out by a dental team which often consists of a dentist and dental auxiliaries dental assistants dental hygienists dental technicians as well as dental therapists
most dentists either work in private practices primary care dental hospitals or secondary care institutions prisons armed forces bases etc
the history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization with the earliest evidence dating from bc to bc
skeletal remains from mehgarh now in pakistan dated to that time show evidence of teeth having been drilled with flint tools to remove decay a method found to be surprisingly effective
dentistry is thought to have been the first specialization in medicine which have gone on to develop its own accredited degree with its own specialisations
the modern movement of evidence based dentistry calls for the use of high quality scientific research and evidence to guide decision making such as in manual tooth conservation use of fluoride water treatment and fluoride toothpaste dealing with oral diseases such as tooth decay and periodontitis as well as systematic diseases such as osteoporosis diabetes celiac disease cancer hiv aids which could also affect the oral cavity
other practices relevant to evidence based dentistry include radiology of the mouth to inspect teeth deformity or oral malaises haematology study of blood to avoid bleeding complications during dental surgery cardiology due to various severe complications arising from dental surgery with patients with heart disease etc
the term dentistry comes from dentist which comes from french dentiste which comes from the french and latin words for tooth
the term for the associated scientific study of teeth is odontology from ancient greek romanized odo s lit tooth the study of the structure development and abnormalities of the teeth
dentistry usually encompasses practices related to the oral cavity
according to the world health organization oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence across the globe with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio economic groups
the majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common oral diseases which are dental caries tooth decay and periodontal disease gum disease or pyorrhea
common treatments involve the restoration of teeth extraction or surgical removal of teeth scaling and root planing endodontic root canal treatment and cosmetic dentistry
all dentists in the united states undergo at least three years of undergraduate studies but nearly all complete a bachelor s degree
this schooling is followed by four years of dental school to qualify as a doctor of dental surgery dds or doctor of dental medicine dmd
specialization in dentistry is available in the fields of anesthesiology dental public health endodontics oral radiology oral maxillofacial surgery oral medicine orofacial pain pathology orthodontics pediatric dentistry periodontics and prosthodontics
by nature of their general training they can carry out the majority of dental treatments such as restorative fillings crowns bridges prosthetic dentures endodontic root canal therapy periodontal gum therapy and extraction of teeth as well as performing examinations radiographs x rays and diagnosis
dentists can also prescribe medications such as antibiotics sedatives and any other drugs used in patient management
depending on their licensing boards general dentists may be required to complete additional training to perform sedation dental implants etc
dentists also encourage prevention of oral diseases through proper hygiene and regular twice or more yearly checkups for professional cleaning and evaluation
oral infections and inflammations may affect overall health and conditions in the oral cavity may be indicative of systemic diseases such as osteoporosis diabetes celiac disease or cancer
many studies have also shown that gum disease is associated with an increased risk of diabetes heart disease and preterm birth
the concept that oral health can affect systemic health and disease is referred to as oral systemic health
john m
harris started the world s first dental school in bainbridge ohio and helped to establish dentistry as a health profession
it opened on february and today is a dental museum
the first dental college baltimore college of dental surgery opened in baltimore maryland us in
the second in the united states was the ohio college of dental surgery established in cincinnati ohio in
the philadelphia college of dental surgery followed in
in temple university accepted a bid to incorporate the school
studies show that dentists that graduated from different countries or even from different dental schools in one country may make different clinical decisions for the same clinical condition
for example dentists that graduated from israeli dental schools may recommend the removal of asymptomatic impacted third molar wisdom teeth more often than dentists that graduated from latin american or eastern european dental schools
in the united kingdom the first dental schools the london school of dental surgery and the metropolitan school of dental science both in london opened in
the british dentists act of and the dentists register limited the title of dentist and dental surgeon to qualified and registered practitioners
however others could legally describe themselves as dental experts or dental consultants
the practice of dentistry in the united kingdom became fully regulated with the dentists act which required the registration of anyone practising dentistry
the british dental association formed in with sir john tomes as president played a major role in prosecuting dentists practising illegally
dentists in the united kingdom are now regulated by the general dental council
in korea taiwan japan finland sweden brazil chile the united states and canada a dentist is a healthcare professional qualified to practice dentistry after graduating with a degree of either doctor of dental surgery dds or doctor of dental medicine dmd
this is equivalent to the bachelor of dental surgery baccalaureus dentalis chirurgiae bds bdent bchd bdsc that is awarded in the uk and british commonwealth countries
in most western countries to become a qualified dentist one must usually complete at least four years of postgraduate study within the european union the education has to be at least five years
dentists usually complete between five and eight years of post secondary education before practising
though not mandatory many dentists choose to complete an internship or residency focusing on specific aspects of dental care after they have received their dental degree
some dentists undertake further training after their initial degree in order to specialize
exactly which subjects are recognized by dental registration bodies varies according to location
examples include
cosmetic dentistry focuses on improving the appearance of the mouth teeth and smile
anesthesiology the specialty of dentistry that deals with the advanced use of general anesthesia sedation and pain management to facilitate dental procedures
dental public health the study of epidemiology and social health policies relevant to oral health
endodontics also called endodontology root canal therapy and study of diseases of the dental pulp and periapical tissues
forensic odontology the gathering and use of dental evidence in law
this may be performed by any dentist with experience or training in this field
the function of the forensic dentist is primarily documentation and verification of identity
geriatric dentistry or geriodontics the delivery of dental care to older adults involving the diagnosis prevention and treatment of problems associated with normal aging and age related diseases as part of an interdisciplinary team with other health care professionals
oral and maxillofacial pathology the study diagnosis and sometimes the treatment of oral and maxillofacial related diseases
oral and maxillofacial radiology the study and radiologic interpretation of oral and maxillofacial diseases
oral and maxillofacial surgery also called oral surgery extractions implants and surgery of the jaws mouth and face
oral biology research in dental and craniofacial biology
oral implantology the art and science of replacing extracted teeth with dental implants
oral medicine the clinical evaluation and diagnosis of oral mucosal diseases
orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics the straightening of teeth and modification of midface and mandibular growth
pediatric dentistry also called pedodontics dentistry for children
periodontology also called periodontics the study and treatment of diseases of the periodontium non surgical and surgical as well as placement and maintenance of dental implants
prosthodontics also called prosthetic dentistry dentures bridges and the restoration of implants
some prosthodontists super specialize in maxillofacial prosthetics which is the discipline originally concerned with the rehabilitation of patients with congenital facial and oral defects such as cleft lip and palate or patients born with an underdeveloped ear microtia
today most maxillofacial prosthodontists return function and esthetics to patients with acquired defects secondary to surgical removal of head and neck tumors or secondary to trauma from war or motor vehicle accidents
special needs dentistry also called special care dentistry dentistry for those with developmental and acquired disabilities
sports dentistry the branch of sports medicine dealing with prevention and treatment of dental injuries and oral diseases associated with sports and exercise
the sports dentist works as an individual consultant or as a member of the sports medicine team
veterinary dentistry the field of dentistry applied to the care of animals
it is a specialty of veterinary medicine tooth decay was low in pre agricultural societies but the advent of farming society about years ago correlated with an increase in tooth decay cavities
an infected tooth from italy partially cleaned with flint tools between and years old represents the oldest known dentistry although a study suggests that years ago the neanderthals already used rudimentary dentistry tools
the indus valley has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as bc during the stone age
the neolithic site of mehrgarh now in pakistan s south western province of balochistan indicates that this form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated perhaps by skilled bead crafters
the reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective
the earliest dental filling made of beeswax was discovered in slovenia and dates from years ago
dentistry was practised in prehistoric malta as evidenced by a skull which had a dental abscess lanced from the root of a tooth dating back to around bc
an ancient sumerian text describes a tooth worm as the cause of dental caries
evidence of this belief has also been found in ancient india egypt japan and china
the legend of the worm is also found in the homeric hymns and as late as the th century ad the surgeon guy de chauliac still promoted the belief that worms cause tooth decay
recipes for the treatment of toothache infections and loose teeth are spread throughout the ebers papyrus kahun papyri brugsch papyrus and hearst papyrus of ancient egypt
the edwin smith papyrus written in the th century bc but which may reflect previous manuscripts from as early as bc discusses the treatment of dislocated or fractured jaws
in the th century bc the code of hammurabi referenced dental extraction twice as it related to punishment
examination of the remains of some ancient egyptians and greco romans reveals early attempts at dental prosthetics
however it is possible the prosthetics were prepared after death for aesthetic reasons
ancient greek scholars hippocrates and aristotle wrote about dentistry including the eruption pattern of teeth treating decayed teeth and gum disease extracting teeth with forceps and using wires to stabilize loose teeth and fractured jaws
some say the first use of dental appliances or bridges comes from the etruscans from as early as bc
in ancient egypt hesy ra is the first named dentist greatest of the teeth
the egyptians bound replacement teeth together with gold wire
roman medical writer cornelius celsus wrote extensively of oral diseases as well as dental treatments such as narcotic containing emollients and astringents
the earliest dental amalgams were first documented in a tang dynasty medical text written by the chinese physician su kung in and appeared in germany in
during the islamic golden age dentistry was discussed in several famous books of medicine such as the canon in medicine written by avicenna and al tasreef by al zahrawi who is considered the greatest surgeon of the middle ages avicenna said that jaw fracture should be reduced according to the occlusal guidance of the teeth this principle is still valid in modern times
al zahrawi invented over surgical tools that resemble the modern kind
historically dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses
during the middle ages and throughout the th century dentistry was not a profession in itself and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general physicians
barbers usually limited their practice to extracting teeth which alleviated pain and associated chronic tooth infection
instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries
in the th century guy de chauliac most probably invented the dental pelican resembling a pelican s beak which was used to perform dental extractions up until the late th century
the pelican was replaced by the dental key which in turn was replaced by modern forceps in the th century
the first book focused solely on dentistry was the artzney buchlein in and the first dental textbook written in english was called operator for the teeth by charles allen in
in the united kingdom there was no formal qualification for the providers of dental treatment until and it was only in that the practice of dentistry was limited to those who were professionally qualified
the royal commission on the national health service in reported that there were then more than twice as many registered dentists per population in the uk than there were in
it was between and that the science of modern dentistry developed
the english physician thomas browne in his a letter to a friend c pub
made an early dental observation with characteristic humour
the french surgeon pierre fauchard became known as the father of modern dentistry
despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late th and early th century fauchard was a highly skilled surgeon who made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments often adapting tools from watchmakers jewelers and even barbers that he thought could be used in dentistry
he introduced dental fillings as treatment for dental cavities
he asserted that sugar derived acids like tartaric acid were responsible for dental decay and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth and in the gums could appear in the later stages of tooth decay
fauchard was the pioneer of dental prosthesis and he invented many methods to replace lost teeth
he suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of ivory or bone
he also introduced dental braces although they were initially made of gold he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires
waxed linen or silk threads were usually employed to fasten the braces
his contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his publication le chirurgien dentiste or the surgeon dentist
the french text included basic oral anatomy and function dental construction and various operative and restorative techniques and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery
after fauchard the study of dentistry rapidly expanded
two important books natural history of human teeth and practical treatise on the diseases of the teeth were published by british surgeon john hunter
in he entered into a period of collaboration with the london based dentist james spence
he began to theorise about the possibility of tooth transplants from one person to another
he realised that the chances of a successful tooth transplant initially at least would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient
these principles are still used in the transplantation of internal organs
hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations in which he attempted a tooth transplant
although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients gums one of hunter s patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years a remarkable achievement for the period
major advances in science were made in the th century and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession
the profession came under government regulation by the end of the th century
in the uk the dentist act was passed in and the british dental association formed in
in the same year francis brodie imlach was the first ever dentist to be elected president of the royal college of surgeons edinburgh raising dentistry onto a par with clinical surgery for the first time
long term occupational noise exposure can contribute to permanent hearing loss which is referred to as noise induced hearing loss nihl and tinnitus
noise exposure can cause excessive stimulation of the hearing mechanism which damages the delicate structures of the inner ear
nihl can occur when an individual is exposed to sound levels above dba according to the occupational safety and health administration osha
regulations state that the permissible noise exposure levels for individuals is dba
for the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh exposure limits are set to dba
exposures below dba are not considered to be hazardous
time limits are placed on how long an individual can stay in an environment above dba before it causes hearing loss
osha places that limitation at hours for dba
the exposure time becomes shorter as the dba level increases
within the field of dentistry a variety of cleaning tools are used including piezoelectric and sonic scalers and ultrasonic scalers and cleaners
while a majority of the tools do not exceed dba prolonged exposure over many years can lead to hearing loss or complaints of tinnitus
few dentists have reported using personal hearing protective devices which could offset any potential hearing loss or tinnitus
there is a movement in modern dentistry to place a greater emphasis on high quality scientific evidence in decision making
evidence based dentistry ebd uses current scientific evidence to guide decisions
it is an approach to oral health that requires the application and examination of relevant scientific data related to the patient s oral and medical health
along with the dentist s professional skill and expertise ebd allows dentists to stay up to date on the latest procedures and patients to receive improved treatment
a new paradigm for medical education designed to incorporate current research into education and practice was developed to help practitioners provide the best care for their patients
it was first introduced by gordon guyatt and the evidence based medicine working group at mcmaster university in ontario canada in the s
it is part of the larger movement toward evidence based medicine and other evidence based practices especially since a major part of dentistry involves dealing with oral and systemic diseases
other issues relevant to the dental field in terms of evidence based research and evidence based practice include population oral health dental clinical practice tooth morphology etc
dentistry is unique in that it requires dental students to have competence based clinical skills that can only be acquired through supervised specialized laboratory training and direct patient care
this necessitates the need for a scientific and professional basis of care with a foundation of extensive research based education
according to some experts the accreditation of dental schools can enhance the quality and professionalism of dental education
