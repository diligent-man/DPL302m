falsifiability is a standard of evaluation of scientific theories and hypotheses that was introduced by the philosopher of science karl popper in his book the logic of scientific discovery
he proposed it as the cornerstone of a solution to both the problem of induction and the problem of demarcation
a theory or hypothesis is falsifiable or refutable if it can be logically contradicted by an empirical test that can potentially be executed with existing technologies
popper insisted that as a logical criterion it is distinct from the related concept capacity to be proven wrong discussed in lakatos s falsificationism
even being a logical criterion its purpose is to make the theory predictive and testable thus useful in practice
popper opposed falsifiability to the intuitively similar concept of verifiability
verifying the claim all swans are white would logically require observing all swans which is not technologically possible
in contrast the observation of a single black swan is technologically reasonable and sufficient to logically falsify the claim
on the other hand the duhem quine thesis says that definitive experimental falsifications are impossible and that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions
in that context popper insisted that there is a clean asymmetry on the logical side and falsifiability does not have the duhem problem because it is a logical criterion
the experimental side and the associated methodology do have the duhem problem and other problems such as the problem of induction but for popper statistical tests which are possible when a theory is falsifiable remain useful in science within a critical discussion
philosophers such as deborah mayo consider that popper comes up short in his description of the scientific role of statistical and data models
as a key notion in the separation of science from non science and pseudo science falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications even being used as legal precedent
one of the questions in scientific method is how does one move from observations to scientific laws this is the problem of induction
suppose we want to put the hypothesis that all swans are white to the test
we come across a white swan
we cannot validly argue or induce from here is a white swan to all swans are white doing so would require a logical fallacy such as for example affirming the consequent
popper s idea to solve this problem is that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white finding a single black swan shows that not every swan is white
we might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white while looking out for examples of non white swans that would show our conjecture to be false
falsification uses the valid inference modus tollens if from a law
displaystyle l
we logically deduce
displaystyle q
but what is observed is
displaystyle neg q
we infer that the law
displaystyle l
is false
for example given the statement
displaystyle l
all swans are white we can deduce
displaystyle q
the specific swan here is white but if what is observed is
displaystyle neg q
the specific swan here is not white say black then all swans are white is false
more accurately the statement
displaystyle q
that can be deduced is broken into an initial condition and a prediction as in
displaystyle c rightarrow p
in which
displaystyle c
the thing here is a swan and
displaystyle p
the thing here is a white swan
if what is observed is c being true while p is false formally
displaystyle c wedge neg p
we can infer that the law is false
for popper induction is actually never needed in science
instead in popper s view laws are conjectured in a non logical manner on the basis of expectations and predispositions
this has led david miller a student and collaborator of popper to write the mission is to classify truths not to certify them
in contrast the logical empiricism movement which included such philosophers as moritz schlick rudolf carnap otto neurath and a j
ayer wanted to formalize the idea that for a law to be scientific it must be possible to argue on the basis of observations either in favor of its truth or its falsity
there was no consensus among these philosophers about how to achieve that but the thought expressed by mach s dictum that where neither confirmation nor refutation is possible science is not concerned was accepted as a basic precept of critical reflection about science
popper said that a demarcation criterion was possible but we have to use the logical possibility of falsifications which is falsifiability
he cited his encounter with psychoanalysis in the s
it did not matter what observation was presented psychoanalysis could explain it
unfortunately the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also
for popper this was a failure because it meant that it could not make any prediction
from a logical standpoint if one finds an observation that does not contradict a law it does not mean that the law is true
a verification has no value in itself
but if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated popper says there is a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all
in the definition of falsifiability contradictions with observations are not used to support eventual falsifications but for logical falsifications that show that the law makes risky predictions which is completely different
on the basic philosophical side of this issue popper said that some philosophers of the vienna circle had mixed two different problems that of meaning and that of demarcation and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless
in opposition to this view popper said that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific and that accordingly a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a criterion of demarcation
the problem of induction is often called hume s problem
david hume studied how human beings obtain new knowledge that goes beyond known laws and observations including how we can discover new laws
he understood that deductive logic could not explain this learning process and argued in favour of a mental or psychological process of learning that would not require deductive logic
he even argued that this learning process can not be justified by any general rules deductive or not
popper accepted hume s argument and therefore viewed progress in science as the result of quasi induction which does the same as induction but has no inference rules to justify it
philip n
johnson laird professor of psychology also accepted hume s conclusion that induction has no justification
for him induction does not require justification and therefore can exist in the same manner as popper s quasi induction does
when johnson laird says that no justification is needed he does not refer to a general method of justification that to avoid a circular reasoning would not itself require any justification
on the contrary in agreement with hume he refers to the fact that there is no general method of justification for induction and that s ok because the induction steps do not require justification
instead these steps use patterns of induction that may or may not be applicable depending on the background knowledge
johnson laird wrote p hilosophers have worried about which properties of objects warrant inductive inferences
the answer rests on knowledge we don t infer that all the passengers on a plane are male because the first ten off the plane are men
we know that this observation doesn t rule out the possibility of a woman passenger the reasoning pattern that was not applied here is enumerative induction
popper was interested in the overall learning process in science to quasi induction which he also called the path of science
however popper did not show much interest in these reasoning patterns which he globally referred to as psychologism
he did not deny the possibility of some kind of psychological explanation for the learning process especially when psychology is seen as an extension of biology but he felt that these biological explanations were not within the scope of epistemology
popper proposed an evolutionary mechanism to explain the success of science which is much in line with johnson laird s view that induction is just something that animals including human beings do to make life possible but popper did not consider it a part of his epistemology
he wrote that his interest was mainly in the logic of science and that epistemology should be concerned with logical aspects only
instead of asking why science succeeds he considered the pragmatic problem of induction
this problem is not how to justify a theory or what is the global mechanism for the success of science but only what methodology do we use to pick one theory among theories that are already conjectured
his methodological answer to the latter question is that we pick the theory that is the most tested with the available technology the one which in the light of our critical discussion appears to be the best so far
by his own account because only a negative approach was supported by logic popper adopted a negative methodology
the purpose of his methodology is to prevent the policy of immunizing our theories against refutation
it also supports some dogmatic attitude in defending theories against criticism because this allows the process to be more complete
this negative view of science was much criticized and not only by johnson laird
in practice some steps based on observations can be justified under assumptions which can be very natural
for example bayesian inductive logic is justified by theorems that make explicit assumptions
these theorems are obtained with deductive logic not inductive logic
they are sometimes presented as steps of induction because they refer to laws of probability even though they do not go beyond deductive logic
this is yet a third notion of induction which overlap with deductive logic in the following sense that it is supported by it
these deductive steps are not really inductive but the overall process that includes the creation of assumptions is inductive in the usual sense
in a fallibilism perspective a perspective that is widely accepted by philosophers including popper every learning step only creates or reinforces an assumption that is all what science does
popper distinguished between the logic of science and its applied methodology
for example newton s law of gravitation is falsifiable it is falsified by the brick fell upwards when released
an explanation for this imaginary state of affairs such as some hidden force other than gravity acting on the brick would make it more intuitive but is not needed for falsifiability because it is a logical criterion
the empirical requirement on the potential falsifier also called the material requirement is only that it is observable inter subjectively with existing technologies
the logical part consists of theories statements and their purely logical relationship together with this material requirement which is needed for a connection with the methodological part
the methodological part consists in popper s view of informal rules which are used to guess theories accept observation statements as factual etc
these include statistical tests popper is aware that observation statements are accepted with the help of statistical methods and that these involve methodological decisions
when this distinction is applied to the term falsifiability it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term
the same is true for the term falsifiable
popper said that he only uses falsifiability or falsifiable in reference to the logical side and that when he refers to the methodological side he speaks instead of falsification and its problems
popper said that methodological problems require proposing methodological rules
for example one such rule is that if one refuses to go along with falsifications then one has retired oneself from the game of science
the logical side does not have such methodological problems in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory because basic statements are not required to be possible
methodological rules are only needed in the context of actual falsifications
so observations have two purposes in popper s view
on the methodological side observations can be used to show that a law is false which popper calls falsification
on the logical side observations which are purely logical constructions do not show a law to be false but contradict a law to show its falsifiability
unlike falsifications and free from the problems of falsification these contradictions establish the value of the law which may eventually be corroborated
he wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not observed
in popper s view of science statements of observation can be analyzed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations
the set of all purely logical observations that are considered constitutes the empirical basis
popper calls them the basic statements or test statements
they are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory
popper says that basic statements do not have to be possible in practice
it is sufficient that they are accepted by convention as belonging to the empirical language a language that allows intersubjective verifiability they must be testable by intersubjective observation the material requirement
see the examples in section examples of demarcation and applications
in more than twelve pages of the logic of scientific discovery popper discusses informally which statements among those that are considered in the logical structure are basic statements
a logical structure uses universal classes to define laws
for example in the law all swans are white the concept of swans is a universal class
it corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have
it is not restricted to the swans that exist existed or will exist
informally a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes
in particular an existential statement such as there exists a black swan is not a basic statement because it is not specific about the instance
on the other hand this swan here is black is a basic statement
popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement
so basic statements are singular existential statements
thornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular observation reports
he then gives popper s definition of falsifiability
as in the case of actual falsifiers decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and often no discussion is even necessary
the first decision described by lakatos is implicit in this agreement but the other decisions are not needed
this agreement if one can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion exists only in principle
this is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important
when an actual falsifier is proposed the technology used is considered in detail and as described in section dogmatic falsificationism an actual agreement is needed
this may require using a deeper empirical basis hidden within the current empirical basis to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly andersson gives some examples
popper says that despite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky more comparable to a swamp than to solid ground the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories without which the whole logical process of science would not be possible
in his analysis of the scientific nature of universal laws popper arrived at the conclusion that laws must allow us to deduce roughly speaking more empirical singular statements than we can deduce from the initial conditions alone a singular statement that has one part only can not contradict a universal law
a falsifier of a law has always two parts the initial condition and the singular statement that contradicts the prediction
however there is no need to require that falsifiers have two parts in the definition itself
this removes the requirement that a falsifiable statement must make prediction
in this way the definition is more general and allows the basic statements themselves to be falsifiable
criteria that require that a law must be predictive just as is required by falsifiability when applied to laws popper wrote have been put forward as criteria of the meaningfulness of sentences rather than as criteria of demarcation applicable to theoretical systems again and again after the publication of my book even by critics who pooh poohed my criterion of falsifiability
scientists such as the nobel laureate herbert a
simon have studied the semantic aspects of the logical side of falsifiability
these studies were done in the perspective that a logic is a relation between formal sentences in languages and a collection of mathematical structures
the relation usually denoted
displaystyle mathfrak a models phi
says the formal sentence
displaystyle phi
is true when interpreted in the structure
displaystyle mathfrak a
it provides the semantic of the languages
according to rynasiewicz in this semantic perspective falsifiability as defined by popper means that in some observation structure in the collection there exists a set of observations which refutes the theory
an even stronger notion of falsifiability was considered which requires not only that there exists one structure with a contradicting set of observations but also that all structures in the collection that cannot be expanded to a structure that satisfies
displaystyle phi
contain such a contradicting set of observations
in response to lakatos who suggested that newton s theory was as hard to show falsifiable as freud s psychoanalytic theory popper gave the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another
it is clearly impossible yet a basic statement that is a valid potential falsifier for newton s theory because the position of the apple at different times can be measured
another example of a basic statement is the inert mass of this object is ten times larger than its gravitational mass this is a basic statement because the inert mass and the gravitational mass can both be measured separately even though it never happens that they are different
it is as described by popper a valid falsifier for einstein s equivalence principle
in a discussion of the theory of evolution popper mentioned industrial melanism as an example of a falsifiable law
a corresponding basic statement that acts as a potential falsifier is in this industrial area the relative fitness of the white bodied peppered moth is high here fitness means reproductive success over the next generation
it is a basic statement because it is possible to separately determine the kind of environment industrial vs natural and the relative fitness of the white bodied form relative to the black bodied form in an area even though it never happens that the white bodied form has a high relative fitness in an industrial area
a famous example of a basic statement from j
haldane is these are fossil rabbits in the precambrian era this is a basic statement because it is possible to find a fossil rabbit and to determine that the date of a fossil is in the precambrian era even though it never happens that the date of a rabbit fossil is in the precambrian era
despite opinions to the contrary some times wrongly attributed to popper this shows the scientific character of paleontology or the history of the evolution of life on earth because it contradicts the hypothesis in paleontology that all mammals existed in a much more recent era
richard dawkins adds that any other modern animal such as a hippo would suffice
a simple example of a non basic statement is this angel does not have large wings
it is not a basic statement because though the absence of large wings can be observed no technology independent of the presence of wings exists to identify angels
even if it is accepted that angels exist the sentence all angels have large wings is not falsifiable
another example from popper of a non basic statement is this human action is altruistic it is not a basic statement because no accepted technology allows us to determine whether or not an action is motivated by self interest
because no basic statement falsifies it the statement that all human actions are egotistic motivated by self interest is thus not falsifiable
some adherents of young earth creationism make an argument called the omphalos hypothesis after the greek word for navel that the world was created with the appearance of age e g the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs
this ad hoc hypothesis introduced into young earth creationism is unfalsifiable because it says that the time of creation of a species measured by the accepted technology is illusory and no accepted technology is proposed to measure the claimed actual time of creation
moreover if the ad hoc hypothesis says that the world was created as we observe it today without stating further laws by definition it cannot be contradicted by observations and thus is not falsifiable
this is discussed by dienes in the case of a variation on the omphalos hypothesis which in addition specifies that god made the creation in this way to test our faith
grover maxwell discussed statements such as all men are mortal
this is not falsifiable because it does not matter how old a man is maybe he will die next year
maxwell said that this statement is nevertheless useful because it is often corroborated
he coined the term corroboration without demarcation
popper s view is that it is indeed useful because popper considers that metaphysical statements can be useful but also because it is indirectly corroborated by the corroboration of the falsifiable law all men die before the age of for popper if no such a falsifiable law exists then the metaphysical law is less useful because it is not indirectly corroborated
this kind of non falsifiable statements in science was noticed by carnap as early as
maxwell also used the example all solids have a melting point this is not falsifiable because maybe the melting point will be reached at a higher temperature
the law is falsifiable and more useful if we specify an upper bound on melting points or a way to calculate this upper bound
another example from maxwell is all beta decays are accompanied with a neutrino emission from the same nucleus this is also not falsifiable because maybe the neutrino can be detected in a different manner
the law is falsifiable and much more useful from a scientific point of view if the method to detect the neutrino is specified
maxwell said that most scientific laws are metaphysical statements of this kind which popper said need to be made more precise before they can be indirectly corroborated
in other words specific technologies must be provided to make the statements inter subjectively verifiable i e so that scientists know what the falsification or its failure actually means
in his critique of the falsifiability criterion maxwell considered the requirement for decisions in the falsification of both the emission of neutrinos see dogmatic falsificationism and the existence of the melting point
for example he pointed out that had no neutrino been detected it could have been because some conservation law is false
popper did not argue against the problems of falsification per se
he always acknowledged these problems
popper s response was at the logical level
for example he pointed out that if a specific way is given to trap the neutrino then at the level of the language the statement is falsifiable because no neutrino was detected after using this specific way formally contradicts it and it is inter subjectively verifiable people can repeat the experiment
in the th and th editions of on the origin of species following a suggestion of alfred russel wallace darwin used survival of the fittest an expression first coined by herbert spencer as a synonym for natural selection
popper and others said that if one uses the most widely accepted definition of fitness in modern biology see subsection evolution namely reproductive success itself the expression survival of the fittest is a tautology
great darwinist ronald fisher worked out mathematical theorems to help answer questions regarding natural selection
but for popper and others there is no falsifiable law of natural selection in this because these tools only apply to some rare traits
instead for popper the work of fisher and others on natural selection is part of an important and successful metaphysical research program
popper said that not all unfalsifiable statements are useless in science
mathematical statements are good examples
like all formal sciences mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the empirical world but rather mathematics is occupied with the theoretical abstract study of such topics as quantity structure space and change
methods of the mathematical sciences are however applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable reality
albert einstein wrote one reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem above all other sciences is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts
popper made a clear distinction between the original theory of marx and what came to be known as marxism later on
for popper the original theory of marx contained genuine scientific laws
though they could not make preordained predictions these laws constrained how changes can occur in society
one of them was that changes in society cannot be achieved by the use of legal or political means
in popper s view this was both testable and subsequently falsified
yet instead of accepting the refutations popper wrote the followers of marx re interpreted both the theory and the evidence in order to make them agree
they thus gave a conventionalist twist to the theory and by this stratagem they destroyed its much advertised claim to scientific status popper s attacks was not directed toward marxism or marx s theories which were falsifiable but toward marxists who he considered to have ignored the falsifications which had happened
popper more fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history given what he saw as our right ability and responsibility to control our own destiny
falsifiability has been used in the mclean v
arkansas case in the daubert case in and other cases
a survey of federal judges conducted in found that p roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too large error rate were cited in less than of cases
in the ruling of the mclean v
arkansas case judge william overton used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that creation science was not scientific and should not be taught in arkansas public schools as such it can be taught as religion
in his testimony philosopher michael ruse defined the characteristics which constitute science as see pennock p and ruse
it is guided by natural law
it has to be explanatory by reference to natural law
it is testable against the empirical world
its conclusions are tentative i e are not necessarily the final word and
it is falsifiable
in his conclusion related to this criterion judge overton stated that
in several cases of the united states supreme court the court described scientific methodology using the five daubert factors which include falsifiability
the daubert result cited popper and other philosophers of science david h
kaye said that references to the daubert majority opinion confused falsifiability and falsification and that inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations
considering the specific detection procedure that was used in the neutrino experiment without mentioning its probabilistic aspect popper wrote it provided a test of the much more significant falsifiable theory that such emitted neutrinos could be trapped in a certain way
in this manner in his discussion of the neutrino experiment popper did not raise at all the probabilistic aspect of the experiment
together with maxwell who raised the problems of falsification in the experiment he was aware that some convention must be adopted to fix what it means to detect or not a neutrino in this probabilistic context
this is the third kind of decisions mentioned by lakatos
for popper and most philosophers observations are theory impregnated
in this example the theory that impregnates observations and justifies that we conventionally accept the potential falsifier no neutrino was detected is statistical
in statistical language the potential falsifier that can be statistically accepted not rejected to say it more correctly is typically the null hypothesis as understood even in popular accounts on falsifiability
different ways are used by statisticians to draw conclusions about hypotheses on the basis of available evidence
fisher neyman and pearson proposed approaches that require no prior probabilities on the hypotheses that are being studied
in contrast bayesian inference emphasizes the importance of prior probabilities
but as far as falsification as a yes no procedure in popper s methodology is concerned any approach that provides a way to accept or not a potential falsifier can be used including approaches that use bayes s theorem and estimations of prior probabilities that are made using critical discussions and reasonable assumptions taken from the background knowledge
there is no general rule that considers has falsified an hypothesis with small bayesian revised probability because as pointed out by mayo and argued before by popper the individual outcomes described in detail will easily have very small probabilities under available evidence without being genuine anomalies
nevertheless mayo adds they can indirectly falsify hypotheses by adding a methodological falsification rule
in general bayesian statistic can play a role in critical rationalism in the context of inductive logic which is said to be inductive because implications are generalized to conditional probabilities
according to popper and other philosophers such as colin howson hume s argument precludes inductive logic but only when the logic makes no use of additional assumptions in particular about what is to be assigned positive prior probability
inductive logic itself is not precluded especially not when it is a deductively valid application of bayes theorem that is used to evaluate the probabilities of the hypotheses using the observed data and what is assumed about the priors
gelman and shalizi mentioned that bayes statisticians do not have to disagree with the non inductivists
because statisticians often associate statistical inference with induction popper s philosophy is often said to have a hidden form of induction
for example mayo wrote the falsifying hypotheses
necessitate an evidence transcending inductive statistical inference
this is hugely problematic for popper
yet also according to mayo popper as a non inductivist acknowledged the useful role of statistical inference in the falsification problems she mentioned that popper wrote her in the context of falsification based on evidence i regret not studying statistics and that her thought was then not as much as i do
imre lakatos divided the problems of falsification in two categories
the first category corresponds to decisions that must be agreed upon by scientists before they can falsify a theory
the other category emerges when one tries to use falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science
lakatos described four kind of falsificationisms in view of how they address these problems
dogmatic falsificationism ignores both types of problems
methodological falsificationism addresses the first type of problems by accepting that decisions must be taken by scientists
naive methodological falsificationism or naive falsificationism does not do anything to address the second type of problems
lakatos used dogmatic and naive falsificationism to explain how popper s philosophy changed over time and viewed sophisticated falsificationism as his own improvement on popper s philosophy but also said that popper some times appears as a sophisticated falsificationist
popper responded that lakatos misrepresented his intellectual history with these terminological distinctions
a dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated
being theory impregnated means that it goes beyond direct experience
for example the statement here is a glass of water goes beyond experience because the concepts of glass and water denote physical bodies which exhibit a certain law like behaviour popper
this leads to the critique that it is unclear which theory is falsified
is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation this is sometimes called the duhem quine problem
an example is galileo s refutation of the theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls
many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false not the theory of celestial bodies
another example is the theory that neutrinos are emitted in beta decays
had they not been observed in the cowan reines neutrino experiment many would have considered that the strength of the beta inverse reaction used to detect the neutrinos was not sufficiently high
at the time grover maxwell wrote the possibility that this strength was sufficiently high was a pious hope
a dogmatic falsificationist ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses
the assumptions or auxiliary hypotheses of a particular test are all the hypotheses that are assumed to be accurate in order for the test to work as planned
the predicted observation that is contradicted depends on the theory and these auxiliary hypotheses
again this leads to the critique that it cannot be told if it is the theory or one of the required auxiliary hypotheses that is false
lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet
if the path contradicts newton s law we will not know if it is newton s law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path
lakatos says that popper s solution to these criticisms requires that one relaxes the assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false methodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a contradicting observation accepted by convention among scientists a convention that implies four kinds of decisions that have these respective goals the selection of all basic statements statements that correspond to logically possible observations selection of the accepted basic statements among the basic statements making statistical laws falsifiable and applying the refutation to the specific theory instead of an auxiliary hypothesis
the experimental falsifiers and falsifications thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory
according to lakatos naive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how scientific knowledge progresses
very often a theory is still useful and used even after it is found in contradiction with some observations
also when scientists deal with two or more competing theories which are both corroborated considering only falsifications it is not clear why one theory is chosen above the other even when one is corroborated more often than the other
in fact a stronger version of the quine duhem thesis says that it is not always possible to rationally pick one theory over the other using falsifications
considering only falsifications it is not clear why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress
popper s critical rationalism uses both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science
how corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers especially between lakatos and popper
popper distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories and accepted basic statements emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated
the main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations could be justified using some kind of formal logic
it is a delicate question because this logic would be inductive it justifies a universal law in view of instances
also falsifications because they are based on methodological decisions are useless in a strict justification perspective
the answer of lakatos and many others to that question is that it should
in contradistinction for popper the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules which naturally say to favour theories that are corroborated over those that are falsified but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous
popper s way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of verisimilitude a way to define how close a theory is to the truth which he did not consider very significant except as an attempt to describe a concept already clear in practice
later it was shown that the specific definition proposed by popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false which is the case for all theories in the history of science
today there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude
hume explained induction with a theory of the mind that was in part inspired by newton s theory of gravitation
popper rejected hume s explanation of induction and proposed his own mechanism science progresses by trial and error within an evolutionary epistemology
hume believed that his psychological induction process follows laws of nature but for him this does not imply the existence of a method of justification based on logical rules
in fact he argued that any induction mechanism including the mechanism described by his theory could not be justified logically
similarly popper adopted an evolutionary epistemology which implies that some laws explain progress in science but yet insists that the process of trial and error is hardly rigorous and that there is always an element of irrationality in the creative process of science
the absence of a method of justification is a built in aspect of popper s trial and error explanation
as rational as they can be these explanations that refer to laws but cannot be turned into methods of justification and thus do not contradict hume s argument or its premises were not sufficient for some philosophers
in particular russell once expressed the view that if hume s problem cannot be solved there is no intellectual difference between sanity and insanity and actually proposed a method of justification
he rejected hume s premise that there is a need to justify any principle that is itself used to justify induction
it might seem that this premise is hard to reject but to avoid circular reasoning we do reject it in the case of deductive logic
it makes sense to also reject this premise in the case of principles to justify induction
lakatos proposal of sophisticated falsificationism was very natural in that context
therefore lakatos urged popper to find an inductive principle behind the trial and error learning process and sophisticated falsificationism was his own approach to address this challenge
kuhn feyerabend musgrave and others mentioned and lakatos himself acknowledged that as a method of justification this attempt failed because there was no normative methodology to justify lakatos methodology was anarchy in disguise
popper s philosophy is sometimes said to fail to recognize the quine duhem thesis which would make it a form of dogmatic falsificationism
for example watkins wrote apparently forgetting that he had once said duhem is right popper set out to devise potential falsifiers just for newton s fundamental assumptions
but popper s philosophy is not always qualified of falsificationism in the pejorative manner associated with dogmatic or naive falsificationism
the problems of falsification are acknowledged by the falsificationists
for example chalmer points out that falsificationists freely admit that observation is theory impregnated
thornton referring to popper s methodology says that the predictions inferred from conjectures are not directly compared with the facts simply because all observation statements are theory laden
for the critical rationalists the problems of falsification are not an issue because they do not try to make experimental falsifications logical or to logically justify them nor to use them to logically explain progress in science
instead their faith rests on critical discussions around these experimental falsifications
lakatos made a distinction between a falsification with quotation marks in popper s philosophy and a falsification without quotation marks that can be used in a systematic methodology where rejections are justified
he knew that popper s philosophy is not and has never been about this kind of justifications but he felt that it should have been
sometimes popper and other falsificationists say that when a theory is falsified it is rejected which appears as dogmatic falsificationism but the general context is always critical rationalism in which all decisions are open to critical discussions and can be revised
as described in section naive falsificationism lakatos and popper agreed that universal laws cannot be logically deduced except from laws that say even more
but unlike popper lakatos felt that if the explanation for new laws can not be deductive it must be inductive
he urged popper explicitly to adopt some inductive principle and sets himself the task to find an inductive methodology
however the methodology that he found did not offer any exact inductive rules
in a response to kuhn feyerabend and musgrave lakatos acknowledged that the methodology depends on the good judgment of the scientists
feyerabend wrote in against method that lakatos methodology of scientific research programmes is epistemological anarchism in disguise and musgrave made a similar comment
in more recent work feyerabend says that lakatos uses rules but whether or not to follow any of these rules is left to the judgment of the scientists
this is also discussed elsewhere
popper also offered a methodology with rules but these rules are also not inductive rules because they are not by themselves used to accept laws or establish their validity
they do that through the creativity or good judgment of the scientists only
for popper the required non deductive component of science never had to be an inductive methodology
he always viewed this component as a creative process beyond the explanatory reach of any rational methodology but yet used to decide which theories should be studied and applied find good problems and guess useful conjectures
quoting einstein to support his view popper said that this renders obsolete the need for an inductive methodology or logical path to the laws
for popper no inductive methodology was ever proposed to satisfactorily explain science
section methodless creativity versus inductive methodology says that both lakatos s and popper s methodology are not inductive
yet lakatos s methodology extended importantly popper s methodology it added a historiographical component to it
this allowed lakatos to find corroborations for his methodology in the history of science
the basic units in his methodology which can be abandoned or pursued are research programmes
research programmes can be degenerative or progressive and only degenerative research programmes must be abandoned at some point
for lakatos this is mostly corroborated by facts in history
in contradistinction popper did not propose his methodology as a tool to reconstruct the history of science
yet some times he did refer to history to corroborate his methodology
for example he remarked that theories that were considered great successes were also the most likely to be falsified
zahar s view was that with regard to corroborations found in the history of science there was only a difference of emphasis between popper and lakatos
as an anecdotal example in one of his articles lakatos challenged popper to show that his theory was falsifiable he asked under what conditions would you give up your demarcation criterion
popper replied i shall give up my theory if professor lakatos succeeds in showing that newton s theory is no more falsifiable by observable states of affairs than is freud s
thomas kuhn analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another whereas popper s view is that only revolutions are relevant
for popper the role of science mathematics and metaphysics actually the role of any knowledge is to solve puzzles
in the same line of thought kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories which represent some paradigm are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question
it is only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur
this can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by popper between the informal and formal process in science see section naive falsificationism
in the big picture presented by kuhn the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations
falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles
all of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory
kuhn says that popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works
popper often uses astrology as an example of a pseudo science
he says that it is not falsifiable because both the theory itself and its predictions are too imprecise
kuhn as an historian of science remarked that many predictions made by astrologers in the past were quite precise and they were very often falsified
he also said that astrologers themselves acknowledged these falsifications
paul feyerabend rejected any prescriptive methodology at all
he rejected lakatos argument for ad hoc hypothesis arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories
he rejected any reliance on a scientific method along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method
he said that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule epistemological anarchism or anything goes would be the only candidate
for feyerabend any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method
in their book fashionable nonsense from published in the uk as intellectual impostures the physicists alan sokal and jean bricmont criticised falsifiability
they include this critique in the intermezzo chapter where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism
even though popper is clearly not a relativist sokal and bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to popper s description of falsifiability and more generally to his theory of science
