falsifiability standard evaluation scientific theory hypothesis wa introduced philosopher science karl popper book logic scientific discovery
theory hypothesis falsifiable refutable logically contradicted empirical test potentially executed existing technologies
popper insisted logical criterion distinct related concept capacity proven wrong discussed lakatos's falsificationism
even logical criterion purpose make theory predictive testable thus useful practice
verifying claim swan white would logically require observing swan technologically possible
contrast observation single black swan technologically reasonable sufficient logically falsify claim
hand duhem-quine thesis say definitive experimental falsification impossible scientific hypothesis capable making predictions
context popper insisted clean asymmetry logical side falsifiability doe duhem problem logical criterion
experimental side associated methodology duhem problem problem problem induction popper statistical test possible theory falsifiable remain useful science within critical discussion
philosopher deborah mayo consider popper come short description scientific role statistical data models
key notion separation science non-science pseudo-science falsifiability ha featured prominently many scientific controversy application even used legal precedent
one question scientific method doe one move observation scientific law problem induction
cannot validly argue induce white swan swan white would require logical fallacy example affirming consequent
popper's idea solve problem impossible verify every swan white finding single black swan show every swan white
might tentatively accept proposal every swan white looking example non-white swan would show conjecture false
specific swan white say black swan white false
instead popper's view law conjectured non-logical manner basis expectation predispositions
ha led david miller student collaborator popper write mission classify truth certify them
contrast logical empiricism movement included philosopher moritz schlick rudolf carnap otto neurath aj
ayer wanted formalize idea law scientific must possible argue basis observation either favor truth falsity
wa consensus among philosopher achieve thought expressed mach's dictum neither confirmation refutation possible science concerned wa accepted basic precept critical reflection science
popper said demarcation criterion wa possible use logical possibility falsification falsifiability
matter observation wa presented psychoanalysis could explain it
unfortunately reason could explain everything exclude anything also
logical standpoint one find observation doe contradict law doe mean law true
law make risky prediction corroborated popper say reason prefer law another law make le risky prediction prediction all
definition falsifiability contradiction observation used support eventual falsification logical falsification show law make risky prediction completely different
basic philosophical side issue popper said philosopher vienna circle mixed two different problem meaning demarcation proposed verificationism single solution statement could verified wa considered meaningless
opposition view popper said meaningful theory scientific accordingly criterion meaningfulness doe coincide criterion demarcation
david hume studied human obtain new knowledge go beyond known law observation including discover new laws
understood deductive logic could explain learning process argued favour mental psychological process learning would require deductive logic
even argued learning process justified general rule deductive not
popper accepted hume's argument therefore viewed progress science result quasi-induction doe induction ha inference rule justify it
johnson-laird professor psychology also accepted hume's conclusion induction ha justification
induction doe require justification therefore exist manner popper's quasi-induction does
johnson-laird say justification needed doe refer general method justification avoid circular reasoning would require justification
contrary agreement hume refers fact general method justification induction that's ok induction step require justification
instead step use pattern induction may may applicable depending background knowledge
johnson-laird wrote philosopher worried property object warrant inductive inferences
answer rest knowledge infer passenger plane male first ten plane men
know observation rule possibility woman passenger reasoning pattern wa applied enumerative induction
popper wa interested overall learning process science quasi-induction also called path science
however popper show much interest reasoning pattern globally referred psychologism
deny possibility kind psychological explanation learning process especially psychology seen extension biology felt biological explanation within scope epistemology
popper proposed evolutionary mechanism explain success science much line johnson-laird's view induction something animal including human make life possible popper consider part epistemology
wrote interest wa mainly logic science epistemology concerned logical aspect only
instead asking science succeeds considered pragmatic problem induction
problem justify theory global mechanism success science methodology use pick one theory among theory already conjectured
methodological answer latter question pick theory tested available technology one light critical discussion appears best far
account negative approach wa supported logic popper adopted negative methodology
also support dogmatic attitude defending theory criticism allows process complete
example bayesian inductive logic justified theorem make explicit assumptions
sometimes presented step induction refer law probability even though go beyond deductive logic
yet third notion induction overlap deductive logic following sense supported it
deductive step really inductive overall process includes creation assumption inductive usual sense
fallibilism perspective perspective widely accepted philosopher including popper every learning step creates reinforces assumptionthat science does
example newton's law gravitation falsifiableit falsified brick fell upwards released
explanation imaginary state affair hidden force gravity acting brick would make intuitive needed falsifiability logical criterion
empirical requirement potential falsifier also called material requirement observable inter-subjectively existing technologies
logical part consists theory statement purely logical relationship together material requirement needed connection methodological part
methodological part consists popper's view informal rule used guess theory accept observation statement factual etc
include statistical test popper aware observation statement accepted help statistical method involve methodological decisions
distinction applied term falsifiability corresponds distinction two completely different meaning term
popper said us falsifiability falsifiable reference logical side refers methodological side speaks instead falsification problems
popper said methodological problem require proposing methodological rules
example one rule one refuse go along falsification one ha retired oneself game science
logical side doe methodological problem particular regard falsifiability theory basic statement required possible
methodological side observation used show law false popper call falsification
logical side observation purely logical construction show law false contradict law show falsifiability
unlike falsification free problem falsification contradiction establish value law may eventually corroborated
popper's view science statement observation analyzed within logical structure independently factual observations
set purely logical observation considered constitutes empirical basis
sufficient accepted convention belonging empirical language language allows intersubjective verifiability must testable intersubjective observation material requirement
twelve page logic scientific discovery popper discus informally statement among considered logical structure basic statements
example law swan white concept swan universal class
informally basic statement simply statement concern finite number specific instance universal classes
particular existential statement exists black swan basic statement specific instance
popper say singular existential statement simply singular statement
thornton say basic statement statement correspond particular observation-reports
case actual falsifier decision must taken scientist accept logical structure associated empirical basis usually part background knowledge scientist common often discussion even necessary
first decision described lakatos implicit agreement decision needed
agreement one speak agreement even discussion exists principle
actual falsifier proposed technology used considered detail described section dogmatic falsificationism actual agreement needed
may require using deeper empirical basis hidden within current empirical basis make sure property value used falsifier obtained correctly andersson give examples
popper say despite fact empirical basis shaky comparable swamp solid ground definition given simply formalization natural requirement scientific theory without whole logical process science would possible
analysis scientific nature universal law popper arrived conclusion law must allow u deduce roughly speaking empirical singular statement deduce initial condition alone singular statement ha one part contradict universal law
falsifier law ha always two part initial condition singular statement contradicts prediction
however need require falsifier two part definition itself
criterion require law must predictive required falsifiability applied law popper wrote put forward criterion meaningfulness sentence rather criterion demarcation applicable theoretical system publication book even critic pooh-poohed criterion falsifiability
study done perspective logic relation formal sentence language collection mathematical structures
according rynasiewicz semantic perspective falsifiability defined popper mean observation structure collection exists set observation refutes theory
even stronger notion falsifiability wa considered requires exists one structure contradicting set observation also structure collection cannot expanded structure satisfies
response lakatos suggested newton's theory wa hard show falsifiable freud's psychoanalytic theory popper gave example apple move ground branch start dance one branch another
clearly impossible yet basic statement valid potential falsifier newton's theory position apple different time measured
another example basic statement inert mass object ten time larger gravitational mass basic statement inert mass gravitational mass measured separately even though never happens different
discussion theory evolution popper mentioned industrial melanism example falsifiable law
corresponding basic statement act potential falsifier industrial area relative fitness white-bodied peppered moth high fitness mean reproductive success next generation
basic statement possible separately determine kind environment industrial v natural relative fitness white-bodied form relative black-bodied form area even though never happens white-bodied form ha high relative fitness industrial area
haldane fossil rabbit precambrian era basic statement possible find fossil rabbit determine date fossil precambrian era even though never happens date rabbit fossil precambrian era
despite opinion contrary time wrongly attributed popper show scientific character paleontology history evolution life earth contradicts hypothesis paleontology mammal existed much recent era
richard dawkins add modern animal hippo would suffice
simple example non-basic statement angel doe large wings
basic statement though absence large wing observed technology independent presence wing exists identify angels
even accepted angel exist sentence angel large wing falsifiable
another example popper non-basic statement human action altruistic basic statement accepted technology allows u determine whether action motivated self-interest
basic statement falsifies statement human action egotistic motivated self-interest thus falsifiable
adherent young-earth creationism make argument called omphalos hypothesis greek word navel world wa created appearance age eg sudden appearance mature chicken capable laying eggs
ad hoc hypothesis introduced young-earth creationism unfalsifiable say time creation specie measured accepted technology illusory accepted technology proposed measure claimed actual time creation
moreover ad hoc hypothesis say world wa created observe today without stating law definition cannot contradicted observation thus falsifiable
discussed dienes case variation omphalos hypothesis addition specifies god made creation way test faith
falsifiable doe matter old man maybe die next year
popper's view indeed useful popper considers metaphysical statement useful also indirectly corroborated corroboration falsifiable law men die age popper falsifiable law exists metaphysical law le useful indirectly corroborated
kind non-falsifiable statement science wa noticed carnap early as
maxwell also used example solid melting point falsifiable maybe melting point reached higher temperature
law falsifiable useful specify upper bound melting point way calculate upper bound
another example maxwell beta decay accompanied neutrino emission nucleus also falsifiable maybe neutrino detected different manner
law falsifiable much useful scientific point view method detect neutrino specified
maxwell said scientific law metaphysical statement kind popper said need made precise indirectly corroborated
word specific technology must provided make statement inter-subjectively-verifiable ie scientist know falsification failure actually means
critique falsifiability criterion maxwell considered requirement decision falsification emission neutrino see dogmatic falsificationism existence melting point
example pointed neutrino detected could conservation law false
example pointed specific way given trap neutrino level language statement falsifiable neutrino wa detected using specific way formally contradicts inter-subjectively-verifiablepeople repeat experiment
edition origin specie following suggestion alfred russel wallace darwin used survival fittest expression first coined herbert spencer synonym natural selection
popper others said one us widely accepted definition fitness modern biology see subsection evolution namely reproductive success expression survival fittest tautology
great darwinist ronald fisher worked mathematical theorem help answer question regarding natural selection
popper others falsifiable law natural selection tool apply rare traits
instead popper work fisher others natural selection part important successful metaphysical research program
like formal science mathematics concerned validity theory based observation empirical world rather mathematics occupied theoretical abstract study topic quantity structure space change
method mathematical science however applied constructing testing scientific model dealing observable reality
albert einstein wrote one reason mathematics enjoys special esteem science law absolutely certain indisputable science extent debatable constant danger overthrown newly discovered facts
popper made clear distinction original theory marx came known marxism later on
popper original theory marx contained genuine scientific laws
though could make preordained prediction law constrained change occur society
one wa change society cannot achieved use legal political means
yet instead accepting refutation popper wrote follower marx re-interpreted theory evidence order make agree
thus gave 'conventionalist twist' theory stratagem destroyed much advertised claim scientific status popper's attack wa directed toward marxism marx's theory falsifiable toward marxist considered ignored falsification happened
popper fundamentally criticized 'historicism' sense preordained prediction history given saw right ability responsibility control destiny
survey federal judge conducted found problem nonfalsifiable nature expert's underlying theory difficulty unknown too-large error rate cited le cases
arkansas case judge william overton used falsifiability one criterion determine creation science wa scientific taught arkansas public school taught religion
testimony philosopher michael ruse defined characteristic constitute science see pennock p ruse
several case united state supreme court court described scientific methodology using five daubert factor include falsifiability
daubert result cited popper philosopher science david h
kaye said reference daubert majority opinion confused falsifiability falsification inquiring existence meaningful attempt falsification appropriate crucial consideration admissibility determinations
considering specific detection procedure wa used neutrino experiment without mentioning probabilistic aspect popper wrote provided test much significant falsifiable theory emitted neutrino could trapped certain way
manner discussion neutrino experiment popper raise probabilistic aspect experiment
together maxwell raised problem falsification experiment wa aware convention must adopted fix mean detect neutrino probabilistic context
example theory impregnates observation justifies conventionally accept potential falsifier neutrino wa detected statistical
statistical language potential falsifier statistically accepted rejected say correctly typically null hypothesis understood even popular account falsifiability
different way used statistician draw conclusion hypothesis basis available evidence
fisher neyman pearson proposed approach require prior probability hypothesis studied
far falsification yesno procedure popper's methodology concerned approach provides way accept potential falsifier used including approach use bayes's theorem estimation prior probability made using critical discussion reasonable assumption taken background knowledge
general rule considers ha falsified hypothesis small bayesian revised probability pointed mayo argued popper individual outcome described detail easily small probability available evidence without genuine anomalies
nevertheless mayo add indirectly falsify hypothesis adding methodological falsification rule
general bayesian statistic play role critical rationalism context inductive logic said inductive implication generalized conditional probabilities
according popper philosopher colin howson hume's argument precludes inductive logic logic make use additional assumption particular assigned positive prior probability
inductive logic precluded especially deductively valid application bayes' theorem used evaluate probability hypothesis using observed data assumed priors
statistician often associate statistical inference induction popper's philosophy often said hidden form induction
yet also according mayo popper non-inductivist acknowledged useful role statistical inference falsification problem mentioned popper wrote context falsification based evidence regret studying statistic thought wa much do
first category corresponds decision must agreed upon scientist falsify theory
category emerges one try use falsification corroboration explain progress science
lakatos described four kind falsificationisms view address problems
methodological falsificationism address first type problem accepting decision must taken scientists
naive methodological falsificationism naive falsificationism doe anything address second type problems
lakatos used dogmatic naive falsificationism explain popper's philosophy changed time viewed sophisticated falsificationism improvement popper's philosophy also said popper time appears sophisticated falsificationist
popper responded lakatos misrepresented intellectual history terminological distinctions
example statement glass water go beyond experience concept glass water denote physical body exhibit certain law-like behaviour popper
one studied one behind observation sometimes called 'duhem-quine problem'
example galileo's refutation theory celestial body faultless crystal balls
many considered wa optical theory telescope wa false theory celestial bodies
observed cowan-reines neutrino experiment many would considered strength beta-inverse reaction used detect neutrino wa sufficiently high
time grover maxwell wrote possibility strength wa sufficiently high wa pious hope
assumption auxiliary hypothesis particular test hypothesis assumed accurate order test work planned
lead critique cannot told theory one required auxiliary hypothesis false
path contradicts newton's law know newton's law false assumption body influenced path
lakatos say popper's solution criticism requires one relaxes assumption observation show theory false methodological falsificationism replaces contradicting observation falsification contradicting observation accepted convention among scientist convention implies four kind decision respective goal selection basic statement statement correspond logically possible observation
experimental falsifier falsification thus depend decision made scientist view currently accepted technology associated theory
according lakatos naive falsificationism claim methodological falsification explain scientific knowledge progresses
often theory still useful used even found contradiction observations
also scientist deal two competing theory corroborated considering falsification clear one theory chosen even one corroborated often other
fact stronger version quine-duhem thesis say always possible rationally pick one theory using falsifications
considering falsification clear often corroborating experiment seen sign progress
popper's critical rationalism us falsification corroboration explain progress science
corroboration falsification explain progress science wa subject disagreement many philosopher especially lakatos popper
popper distinguished creative informal process theory accepted basic statement emerge logical formal process theory falsified corroborated
main issue whether decision select theory among competing theory light falsification corroboration could justified using kind formal logic
delicate question logic would inductive justifies universal law view instances
also falsification based methodological decision useless strict justification perspective
contradistinction popper creative informal part guided methodological rule naturally say favour theory corroborated falsified methodology hardly made rigorous
popper's way analyze progress science wa concept verisimilitude way define close theory truth consider significant except attempt describe concept already clear practice
later wa shown specific definition proposed popper cannot distinguish two theory false case theory history science
hume explained induction theory mind wa part inspired newton's theory gravitation
popper rejected hume's explanation induction proposed mechanism science progress trial error within evolutionary epistemology
hume believed psychological induction process follows law nature doe imply existence method justification based logical rules
fact argued induction mechanism including mechanism described theory could justified logically
similarly popper adopted evolutionary epistemology implies law explain progress science yet insists process trial error hardly rigorous always element irrationality creative process science
absence method justification built-in aspect popper's trial error explanation
rational explanation refer law cannot turned method justification thus contradict hume's argument premise sufficient philosophers
particular russell expressed view hume's problem cannot solved intellectual difference sanity insanity actually proposed method justification
rejected hume's premise need justify principle used justify induction
might seem premise hard reject avoid circular reasoning reject case deductive logic
make sense also reject premise case principle justify induction
therefore lakatos urged popper find inductive principle behind trial error learning process sophisticated falsificationism wa approach address challenge
kuhn feyerabend musgrave others mentioned lakatos acknowledged method justification attempt failed wa normative methodology justifylakatos' methodology wa anarchy disguise
popper's philosophy sometimes said fail recognize quine-duhem thesis would make form dogmatic falsificationism
example watkins wrote apparently forgetting said 'duhem right ' popper set devise potential falsifier newton's fundamental assumptions
popper's philosophy always qualified falsificationism pejorative manner associated dogmatic naive falsificationism
example chalmer point falsificationists freely admit observation theory impregnated
thornton referring popper's methodology say prediction inferred conjecture directly compared fact simply observation-statements theory-laden
critical rationalist problem falsification issue try make experimental falsification logical logically justify use logically explain progress science
instead faith rest critical discussion around experimental falsifications
lakatos made distinction falsification quotation mark popper's philosophy falsification without quotation mark used systematic methodology rejection justified
knew popper's philosophy ha never kind justification felt been
sometimes popper falsificationists say theory falsified rejected appears dogmatic falsificationism general context always critical rationalism decision open critical discussion revised
described section naive falsificationism lakatos popper agreed universal law cannot logically deduced except law say even more
unlike popper lakatos felt explanation new law deductive must inductive
urged popper explicitly adopt inductive principle set task find inductive methodology
response kuhn feyerabend musgrave lakatos acknowledged methodology depends good judgment scientists
feyerabend wrote method lakatos' methodology scientific research programme epistemological anarchism disguise musgrave made similar comment
recent work feyerabend say lakatos us rule whether follow rule left judgment scientists
popper also offered methodology rule rule also inductive rule used accept law establish validity
popper required non deductive component science never inductive methodology
always viewed component creative process beyond explanatory reach rational methodology yet used decide theory studied applied find good problem guess useful conjectures
quoting einstein support view popper said render obsolete need inductive methodology logical path laws
popper inductive methodology wa ever proposed satisfactorily explain science
section methodless creativity versus inductive methodology say lakatos's popper's methodology inductive
yet lakatos's methodology extended importantly popper's methodology added historiographical component it
research programme degenerative progressive degenerative research programme must abandoned point
contradistinction popper propose methodology tool reconstruct history science
example remarked theory considered great success also likely falsified
zahar's view wa regard corroboration found history science wa difference emphasis popper lakatos
anecdotal example one article lakatos challenged popper show theory wa falsifiable asked condition would give demarcation criterion
popper replied shall give theory professor lakatos succeeds showing newton's theory falsifiable 'observable state affairs' freud's
thomas kuhn analyzed call period normal science well revolution one period normal science another whereas popper's view revolution relevant
popper role science mathematics metaphysics actually role knowledge solve puzzles
line thought kuhn observes period normal science scientific theory represent paradigm used routinely solve puzzle validity paradigm hardly question
important new puzzle emerge cannot solved accepted theory revolution might occur
seen viewpoint distinction made popper informal formal process science see section naive falsificationism
big picture presented kuhn routinely solved puzzle corroborations
kuhn say popper emphasizes formal logical falsification fails explain social informal process works
kuhn historian science remarked many prediction made astrologer past quite precise often falsified
rejected lakatos' argument ad hoc hypothesis arguing science would progressed without making use available method support new theories
rejected reliance scientific method along special authority science might derive method
said one keen universally valid methodological rule epistemological anarchism anything go would candidate
feyerabend special status science might derives social physical value result science rather method
