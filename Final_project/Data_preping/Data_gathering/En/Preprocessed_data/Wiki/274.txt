hunter is an american crime drama television series created by frank lupo which ran on nbc from september to april
it stars fred dryer as sgt
rick hunter and stepfanie kramer as sgt
dee dee mccall
the title character sgt
rick hunter is a wily physically imposing often rule breaking homicide detective with the los angeles police department
the show s executive producer during the first season was stephen j
cannell whose company produced the series
stepfanie kramer left after the sixth season to pursue other acting and musical opportunities
in the seventh season hunter partnered with two different female officers
the show began in a tuesday night time slot with the two part pilot episodes of hunter initially broadcast in a time slot on a friday night competing for ratings against the popular dallas
the show struggled to attract an audience and drew criticism for its often graphic depiction of violence
in the first season the producers sought to create a hook by giving the main character a catchphrase works for me which was sometimes used two or three times in an episode and was even added to the end of mike post and pete carpenter s opening theme music
several early episodes featured montages set to popular songs from the s s and s in a style similar to miami vice
midway through the first season with low ratings still cannell gave network chief brandon tartikoff a private screening of a two part episode the snow queen that had not yet aired and asked him to give the show more time to attract viewers
tartikoff agreed and put the show on hiatus until a better time slot could be found
two months later hunter resumed this time on saturday nights and viewership slowly started to rise
the first season finished in th place
for its second season cannell brought in his mentor roy huggins best known for his work on maverick and the rockford files to refine the show
as the new executive producer huggins pushed up the violence but softened the main character s fractious relationship with his superiors dropped a backstory concerning hunter s family ties to the mob and emphasized the chemistry between hunter and mccall
huggins also moved the show s setting out of the back streets and into the more desirable areas of los angeles
emboldened dryer and kramer frequently improvised the scripts and the hunter character broke the fourth wall for the first time with an aside to viewers at the end of the episode the beautiful and the dead
probably the most memorable aspect to the second season was the two part episode rape and revenge which may have drawn from some diplomatic immunity scandals that were prominent in the news
a psychopathic foreign diplomat meets mccall and wants to have a relationship with her and after she declines he brutally rapes her in her home
hunter is badly shot in the shoulder and must recover quickly then go to the diplomat s home country to dispense justice hunter style
this episode was considered very controversial for its realistic and shocking depiction of a violent rape which was not common in tv shows at the time
because of the controversial plot and acting rape and revenge is one of the most remembered and popular episodes of the series
another important aspect to the second season was towards its end in the episode the return of typhoon thompson when viewers were first introduced to hunter and mccall s favorite street informant the humorous arnold sporty james played by garrett morris
viewers also responded to huggins changes and the show s second season ended in th place in the nielsen ratings
hunter continued this progress to become a mainstay of nbc s saturday night schedule
in syndication the season two introduction was replaced by the season one introduction
the former showed hunter entering a women s locker room in one scene and mccall and him pointing their guns at each other with the bathroom light on in another scene
just before work on the third season began dryer threatened to quit unless his salary reportedly us per episode was raised and creative changes were made
cannell responded with a us million breach of contract lawsuit
a compromise was reached a new deal with dryer reportedly earning us per episode
the third season again led by huggins added charles hallahan as captain charlie devane who remained hunter and mccall s captain for the rest of the show eventually included in the opening credits of the show and becoming one of the show s main stars none of the previous captains in the series had achieved this
this was the show s first season in the top coming in at th
in the episode shades which was the season finale but aired later in the summer in july when hunter went missing mccall teamed with a somewhat ditzy columbo like detective kitty o hearn shelley taylor morgan
o hearn reappeared during the season four three part episode city of passion
another remembered episode from season three was requiem for sergeant mccall which was a contradiction to a storyline from the beginning of the show
when the show first started mccall s husband steven mccall was supposedly killed five years before in by a punk kid during a routine stop
at that time steven and dee dee were newly married and starting out as rookie uniform cops
however in in requiem just five years before which would be around instead of steven was a homicide detective while dee dee was still just a rookie and he was working on a big murder case that resulted in him being killed
in requiem steven s killer is getting paroled and dee dee mccall is doing everything she can to get him back in prison plus trying to solve the original murder case that her husband died trying to solve five years earlier
another notable episode was any second now in which theresa saldana played a pianist being stalked by a psychotic fan
this was based on the real life incident saldana herself was a victim of when she was stalked and brutally stabbed by scottish immigrant and drifter arthur richard jackson outside her los angeles home in
the violent attack later became the subject of the tv film victims for victims the theresa saldana story and jackson was then extradited to england to be tried for a robbery and murder
he was committed to a psychiatric hospital and remained there until when he died of heart failure
huggins retired at the end of the fourth season which placed th in the nielsen ratings
a three part storyline city of passion teamed hunter and dee dee with detective o hearn morgan and her new partner sgt
brad navarro erik estrada
together they captured the serial rapist called big foot
originally the plot of city of passion involved mccall getting raped again this time by big foot and she had to deal with the pain and emotions as she did in the second season s rape and revenge
however stepfanie kramer immediately balked at this and argued the rape idea had already been done and to repeat it as well as having her character put in a situation to get raped again was ridiculous
kramer threatened to quit unless the script was changed
producers and writers agreed and a compromise was made big foot attacked and attempted to rape mccall but she fought him and prevented the rape
also known as one of the more memorable episodes for fourth season was the black dahlia
the real life infamous unsolved black dahlia la murder case from is thrust back into headlines as bones with identical cuts to the historical case are discovered under an old building being demolished
in the episode hunter and mccall solve the famous murder case years to the day as the episode aired on the anniversary date of the real life murder
as a special message at the end states the real life case is still open and the real killer has never been found
opening credits changed most notably removal of the gun and car action clips used in previous seasons
this reflected a change in the format where the frequent car chases and shootouts from the first three seasons were dropped and the show became more of a standard police procedural with only occasional action scenes
for the fifth season george geiger took on the role of executive producer having worked in the same capacity on scarecrow and mrs
king as well as a brief stint as co executive producer on miami vice
in the first four seasons hunter and mccall typically worked on cases together allowing the producers to showcase the chemistry between the actors but the fifth season increasingly had them working apart ostensibly to lessen the workload of dryer and kramer and to allow richer more complex stories
so instead of jeans and an old sports jacket hunter often was seen in a full suit and tie
one of the most memorable episodes of the fifth season was the special three part episode city under siege which had a special introduction for each of the three parts
it dealt with a psychotic woman named iris smith cec verrell and her crazy boyfriend billy joe powell daniel quinn who terrorized the city of los angeles committing multiple murders against people who the woman felt had wronged her in some way
hunter was one of the intended victims having arrested billy joe years earlier for a series of murders in which he killed his female victims with a straight razor
one sub plot focused on the huge crime spree throughout the city and the pressure the police department was under to get it under control
another sub plot involved a corrupt deputy chief named curtis moorehead robert vaughn who continually hamstrung the entire police department s efforts to find iris and billy joe in order to further his own ends
further compounding the problem was jack small james sikking a local resident who aggressively took the law into his own hands to combat the local crime wave earning him a reputation in his neighborhood as an urban vigilante
he had a teenage daughter debbie brynn horrocks who was a good hearted but troubled young woman whom mccall befriended while she was working undercover at her high school investigating the murder of one of the teachers named sandra clemens
sandra was iris old teacher whom she had a grudge against for stopping her from stealing lunch money from a fellow student
another subplot of the story revolved around johnny youngblood craig hurley a mover and shaker at the school who dealt in various shady enterprises
also appearing in a guest starring role was real life journalist saida pagan as television reporter saida rodrigues pagan
in part two laurelle brooks guest starred as allison a naive high school cheerleader who falls under johnny s charms and unknown to her make a videotape of them having sex
at the end of the episode statistics were presented showing a reduction of crime in los angeles that year
the fifth season placed th in the nielsen ratings
uniformed officers costumes changed dropping the metro police shoulder patch of previous four seasons leaving the uniforms looking more the real lapd
door shields on patrol cars also changed to look like those of lapd
by the sixth season dryer s growing influence had won him the role of executive producer
probably the most remembered episode of the sixth season was unfinished business
during this episode the audience learns that hunter and mccall had actually once slept together causing a rift in their working relationship
fred dryer stated that this episode was filmed to try to appease fans and the network who were constantly wanting hunter and mccall to get together
however fred dryer and stepfanie kramer stated they did not want that to happen because once it did hunter would become hart to hart
another memorable episode this season was yesterday s child
in this episode a vietnamese man visits hunter and pleads with him to take on the case of a robbery and murder at an upscale car dealership of which his son was the main suspect
over the course of the conversation hunter discovers that the year old suspect was actually his own son
the boy is revealed to be the product of a relationship hunter had with a woman while he was in vietnam
also for this season homicide was moved to the more updated parker center instead of the old downtown division building
however at the end of the sixth season which placed th in the nielsen ratings stepfanie kramer decided to leave the series to pursue a career in music
kramer s character was written out in the season s two part finale showing the mccall character marrying an old flame and moving out of los angeles
for the seventh and final season nbc shifted the show to pm on wednesdays
a new female co star darlanne fluegel as officer joanne molenski was brought in
however she reportedly had creative differences with fred dryer and halfway through the season she decided she wanted out
her character was murdered by a female serial killer in the two part episode fatal obsession
her replacement for the second half of the season was lauren lane as sgt
chris novak supposedly a former girlfriend of hunter s
hunter s signature unmarked vehicle a moss green dodge monaco was also finally replaced after an accident with molenski s cruiser in the season s first episode by an updated new silver ford ltd crown victoria
hunter was now also back to wearing jeans and a shirt
also for the first time aside from the sixth season finale hunter made sporadic appearances in uniform
however the new partners and changes did little to boost ratings th in the nielsen standings
a salary dispute involving dryer led to the show being discontinued at the end of the season
four years after the original series ended a reunion nbc tv movie the return of hunter everyone walks in l a had dryer and charles hallahan reprise their roles as rick hunter and charlie devane
hunter had now also been promoted to lieutenant
airing on march the movie seemed to take the dirty harry idea as the plot a psycho wants fame and or to be noticed and begins terrorizing the city to gain media attention
along the way he becomes infatuated with attention from hunter eventually wanting to kill him
stepfanie kramer pregnant at the time did not reprise her role as dee dee mccall
the tv movie co starred barry bostwick miguel ferrer and john c
mcginley
seven years later in november years after the original series ended the reunion tv movie hunter return to justice made its premiere to strong ratings
this time stepfanie kramer returned to her role as mccall and the show s setting switched from los angeles to san diego as hunter s current l a
partner is killed in the line of duty
given the success of the tv movie cannell dryer and nbc attempted to bring back hunter as a regular series the april airing of another tv movie hunter back in force served as the pilot for the new series
the network decided to broadcast three new one hour episodes of hunter vaya sin dios untouchable and dead heat
another two episodes were filmed as originally five episodes were to be aired but never shown in the u s as nbc decided to cancel the new series
fred dryer later cited creative difficulties and budget constraints as the reasons for the revival s unexpected end

during the sixth season her final season she drove a gold colored dodge dynasty
an episode during the fourth or fifth season showed the outside of what was supposedly mccall s house and a yellow ford mustang was out front
however mccall is only shown driving it once and then it was never shown again

chris novak during last season drove a tan beige ltd crown victoria
in the first reunion film the return of hunter everyone walks in l a hunter drove a black ford crown victoria
