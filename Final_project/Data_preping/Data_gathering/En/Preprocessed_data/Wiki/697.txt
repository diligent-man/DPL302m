postorgasmic illness syndrome is a syndrome in which people have chronic physical and cognitive symptoms immediately following ejaculation
the symptoms last for up to a week
the cause and prevalence are unknown it is considered a rare disease
the distinguishing characteristics of pois are
the rapid onset of symptoms after ejaculation
the presence of an overwhelming systemic reaction pois symptoms which are called a pois attack can include some combination of the following cognitive dysfunction aphasia severe muscle pain throughout the body severe fatigue weakness and flu like or allergy like symptoms such as sneezing itchy eyes and nasal irritation
additional symptoms include headache dizziness lightheadedness extreme hunger sensory and motor problems intense discomfort irritability anxiety gastrointestinal disturbances craving for relief susceptibility to nervous system stresses e g
common cold depressed mood and difficulty communicating remembering words reading and retaining information concentrating and socializing
affected individuals may also experience intense warmth or cold
an online anonymous self report study found that of respondents always experienced the symptom cluster involving fatigue insomnia irritation and concentration difficulties
the symptoms usually begin within minutes of ejaculation and can last for several days sometimes up to a week
in some men the onset of pois is in puberty while in others the onset is later in life
pois that is manifest from the first ejaculations in adolescence is called primary type pois that starts later in life is called secondary type
many individuals with pois report lifelong premature ejaculation with intravaginal ejaculation latency time ielt of less than one minute
the clusters of symptoms of criterion
general extreme fatigue exhaustion palpitations problems finding words incoherent speech dysarthria concentration difficulties quickly irritated cannot stand noise photophobia depressed mood
flu like feverish extreme warmth perspiration shivery ill with flu feeling sick feeling cold
head headache foggy feeling in the head heavy feeling in the head
eyes burning red injected eyes blurred vision watery irritating itching eyes painful eyes
nose congestion nose watery runny nose sneezing
throat dirty taste in mouth dry mouth sore throat tickling cough hoarse voice
muscle muscle tension behind neck muscle weakness pain in muscles heavy legs stiff muscles
pois has been called by a number of other names including postejaculatory syndrome postorgasm illness syndrome post ejaculation sickness and post orgasmic sick syndrome
dhat syndrome is a condition first described in in india with symptoms similar to pois
dhat syndrome is thought to be a culture bound psychiatric condition and is treated with cognitive behavioral therapy along with anti anxiety and antidepressant drugs
post coital tristesse pct is a feeling of melancholy and anxiety after sexual intercourse that lasts anywhere from five minutes to two hours
pct which affects both men and women occurs only after sexual intercourse and does not require an orgasm to occur and in that its effects are primarily emotional rather than physiological
by contrast pois affects only men consists primarily of physiological symptoms that are triggered by ejaculation and that can last in some people for up to a week
while pct and pois are distinct conditions some doctors speculate that they could be related
an array of more subtle and lingering symptoms after orgasm which do not constitute pois may contribute to habituation between mates
they may show up as restlessness irritability increased sexual frustration apathy sluggishness neediness dissatisfaction with a mate or weepiness over the days or weeks after intense sexual stimulation
such phenomena may be part of human mating physiology itself
sexual headache is a distinct condition characterized by headaches that usually begin before or during orgasm
the cause of pois is unknown
some doctors hypothesize that pois is caused by an auto immune reaction
other doctors suspect a hormone imbalance as the cause
while other causes have been proposed as well none of the proposed causes seem to fully explain the disease
according to one hypothesis pois is caused by type i and type iv allergy to the males own semen
pois could also be caused by an auto immune reaction not to semen itself but to another substance that is released during ejaculation such as to cytokines
the allergy hypothesis has been disputed
according to one study ige mediated semen allergy in men may not be the potential mechanism of pois
according to another hypothesis pois is caused by a hormone imbalance such as low progesterone low cortisol low testosterone elevated prolactin hypothyroidism or low dhea
pois could be caused by a defect in neurosteroid precursor synthesis
in this case the same treatment may not be effective for different individuals
different individuals may have different missing precursors ultimately leading to a deficiency of the same particular neurosteroid causing similar symptoms
it may be noted that the majority of pois symptoms including flu like symptoms fatigue muscle pains sweating mood disturbances irritability poor concentration and others are similarly caused during withdrawal from different drug classes and natural reinforcers
it s actually unknown if there could be a relationship between hypersexuality pornography addiction compulsive sexual behavior and pois
some evidence claims that pois patients have a history of excessive masturbation in the early stage and it implicitly suggests that pois could be a consequence of sex addiction
there is anecdotal evidence on porn addiction internet fora that many men experience pois like symptoms after ejaculation
pois could also be caused by hyperglycemia or by chemical imbalances in the brain
sexual activity for the first time may set the stage for an associated asthma attack or may aggravate pre existing asthma
intense emotional stimuli during sexual intercourse can lead to autonomic imbalance with parasympathetic over reactivity thereby causing release of mast cell mediators that can provoke postcoital asthma and or rhinitis in these patients
it is also possible that in different individuals the causes of pois are different
pois could represent a spectrum of syndromes of differing causes
none of the currently proposed causes for pois fully explain the connection between pois and lifelong premature ejaculation
there is no generally agreed upon diagnostic criteria for pois
one group has developed five preliminary criteria for diagnosing pois
these are
one or more of the following symptoms sensation of a flu like state extreme fatigue or exhaustion weakness of musculature experiences of feverishness or perspiration mood disturbances and or irritability memory difficulties concentration problems incoherent speech congestion of nose or watery nose itching eyes
all symptoms occur immediately e g seconds soon e g minutes or within a few hours after ejaculation that is initiated by coitus and or masturbation and or spontaneously e g during sleep
symptoms occur always or nearly always e g in more than of ejaculation events
most of these symptoms last for about days and
disappear spontaneously
pois is prone to being erroneously ascribed to psychological factors such as hypochondriasis or somatic symptom disorder
an online survey study suggested that only a small number of self reported pois fulfill entirely the five criteria
this study proposed to change the criterion with in at least one ejaculatory setting sex masturbation or nocturnal emission symptoms occur after all or almost all ejaculations
there is no standard method of treating or managing pois
patients need to be thoroughly examined in an attempt to find the causes of their pois symptoms which are often difficult to determine and which vary across patients
once a cause is hypothesized an appropriate treatment can be attempted
at times more than one treatment is attempted until one that works is found
affected individuals typically avoid sexual activity especially ejaculation or schedule it for times when they can rest and recover for several days afterwards
in case post coital tristesse pct is suspected patients could be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
in one patient the pois symptoms were so severe that he decided to undergo removal of the testicles prostate and seminal vesicles in order to relieve them
the pois symptoms were cured by this
another patient in whom pois was suspected to be caused by cytokine release was successfully treated with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids just prior to and for a day or two after ejaculation
the patient took diclofenac mg to hours prior to sexual activity with orgasm and continued twice daily for to hours
one pois patient with erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation had much lower severity of symptoms on those occasions when he was able to maintain penile erection long enough to achieve vaginal penetration and ejaculate inside his partner
the patient took tadalafil to treat his erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation
this increased the number of occasions on which he was able to ejaculate inside his partner and decreased the number of occasions on which he experienced pois symptoms
this patient is thought to have dhat syndrome rather than true pois
two patients in whom pois was suspected to be caused by auto immune reaction to their own semen were successfully treated by allergen immunotherapy with their own autologous semen
they were given multiple subcutaneous injections of their own semen for three years
treatment with autologous semen might take to years before any clinically relevant symptom reduction would become manifest
treatments are not always successful especially when the cause of pois in a particular patient has not been determined
in one patient all of whose routine laboratory tests were normal the following were attempted all without success ibuprofen mg on demand tramadol mg one hour pre coitally and escitalopram mg daily at bedtime for months
the prevalence of pois is unknown
pois is listed as a rare disease by the american national institutes of health and the european orphanet
it is thought to be underdiagnosed and underreported
pois seems to affect mostly men from around the world of various ages and relationship statuses
it is possible that a similar disease exists in women though as of there is only one documented female patient
