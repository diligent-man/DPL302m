spiritual assembly is a term given by abdu l bah to refer to elected councils that govern the bah faith
because the bah faith has no clergy they carry out the affairs of the community
in addition to existing at the local level there are national spiritual assemblies although national in some cases refers to a portion of a country or to a group of countries
spiritual assemblies form part of the elected branch of the bah administration
bah u ll h abdu l bah and shoghi effendi stated how spiritual assemblies should be elected by the bah s defined their nature and purposes and described in considerable detail how they should function
since these institutions are grounded in the bah authoritative texts bah s regard them as divine in nature and contrast the wealth of scriptural guidance with the paucity of scriptural texts on which jewish christian and islamic religious institutions are based
the universal house of justice has added that among the responsibilities of local spiritual assemblies are to be channels of divine guidance planners of the teaching work developers of human resources builders of communities and loving shepherds of the multitudes on a practical level they organize local bah communities by maintaining a local bah fund owning the local bah center if one exists organizing bah events counseling bah s about personal difficulties assisting with bah marriages and funerals providing educational programs to adults and children publicizing the bah faith locally fostering projects for the social and economic development of the region and enrolling new members of the religion
spiritual assemblies appoint individuals task forces and committees to carry out many of their functions
national spiritual assemblies have a similar mandate at the national level they coordinate publishing and distribution of bah literature direct relations with national organizations and governmental agencies oversee the work of local spiritual assemblies and in some countries regional councils set local bah jurisdictional boundaries provide various educational services and programs and set the overall tone and direction of the national community
the origin of the institution of the local spiritual assembly originates from bah u ll h s book of laws the kit b i aqdas
the lord hath ordained that in every city a house of justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of baha and should it exceed this number it doth not matter
they should consider themselves as entering the court of the presence of god the exalted the most high and as beholding him who is the unseen
it behoveth them to be the trusted ones of the merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of god for all that dwell on earth
it is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the servants of god for his sake even as they regard their own interests and to choose that which is meet and seemly the passage gives the institution a name a minimum number nine for the number of baha refers to the numerical value of the letters of that word which is nine and a general responsibility to take care of the welfare of others even as they would take care of their own
while the resulting institution is local in the kit b i aqdas bah u ll h also spoke about the responsibilities of the supreme or universal house of justice
in response to the passage m rz asadu ll h isfah n a prominent bah teacher organized an unofficial bah consultative body in tehran iran about
the first official bah consultative body was organized under abdu l bah s direction by hand of the cause haj kh nd in tehran in by it was an elected body
because of the difficulties in iran caused by persecution of the bah faith the tehran body served to coordinate both local and national bah activities
it is not known what name the body was organized under
the development of a bah community in the united states in the s necessitated the creation of local bah consultative bodies there
in the bah s of chicago elected a local council based on their awareness of the provisions of the kit b i aqdas which was circulated in provisional english translation as a typescript as early as
the new york bah s elected a board of counsel in december
in the chicago body was reorganized and re elected and took the name house of justice of bahais of chicago ills in response abdu l bah revealed three tablets of encouragement and guidance to the body including prayers to say at the beginning and end of their meetings prayers that bah s use around the world today for their spiritual assembly meetings
in abdu l bah sent a very important tablet to the chicago governing body where he said let the designation of that body be spiritual assembly this for the reason that were it to use the term house of justice the government might hereafter come to suppose that it was acting as a court of law or concerning itself in political matters or that at some indeterminate future time it would involve itself in the affairs of government
this same designation hath been universally adopted throughout iran for this reason bah local and national governing bodies are designated spiritual assemblies to this day
the first decade of the twentieth century saw the proliferation of local bah governing bodies
often unaware of abdu l bah s guidance they had a variety of titles in english and persian such as council board board of consultation house of spirituality and executive committee unaware abdu l bah had told the chicago bah s to elect their body every five years they were usually elected annually or even semi annually
the number of members varied from five to nineteen except in new york city where abdu l bah in said they should elect twenty seven members in order to be inclusive of and to foster unity between that city s diverse bah groups
they were male only until abdu l bah said in that women should be elected to the local governing bodies existing in the united states their exclusion from local bodies continued in iran until the s because of iranian cultural conventions
in the period of consultative bodies are known to have existed in kenosha wisconsin boston massachusetts washington d c spokane washington northern hudson county new jersey the greater san francisco area california in the united states and in bombay british raj india cairo khedivate of egypt acre ottoman syria baku tbilisi ashgabat and samarqand in the russian empire and mashhad abadih qazvin and tabriz persia
consultative bodies also existed for the jewish and zoroastrian bah s in tehran and for the women of a few bah communities
because efforts to organize local bah consultative bodies remained informal few additional ones had formed by notable exceptions being cleveland ohio and london and some of the ones in the united states had lapsed
upon assuming the guardianship of the bah faith shoghi effendi read abdu l bah s will and testament and made establishment of local spiritual assemblies an early priority
his second general letter to the bah s of the world dated march referred to the vital necessity of having a local spiritual assembly in every locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine the letter also quoted extensively from bah u ll h and abdu l bah about the purposes and duties of spiritual assemblies
the result was a rapid proliferation of local spiritual assemblies a list had the following australia brazil burma canada china egypt england france india japan korea lebanon new zealand palestine iran russia south africa switzerland syria turkey and the united states for a total of local spiritual assemblies worldwide
the number has grown ever since in there were local spiritual assemblies worldwide
national spiritual assemblies are first mentioned in abdu l bah s will and testament but the fact that they would be established circulated for years before the contents of the will became publicly available in early
in hippolyte dreyfus fr wrote extensively about the role of the national house of justice as it would have been known then in his the universal religion bahaism its rise and social import
in that year also the bah s of the united states and canada elected a nine member executive committee for the bahai temple unity a continental consultative body formed to build the bah house of worship in wilmette illinois a suburb of chicago
subsequently the bahai temple unity which held annual conventions appointed committees to publish bah literature coordinate the spread of the bah faith across north america and review bah publications for their accuracy
by the time of abdu l bah s passing in november the bahai temple unity functioned as a national bah coordinating body
in the same march letter to the bah s of the world that called for the election of local spiritual assemblies shoghi effendi called on them to indirectly elect national spiritual assemblies
he also enumerated committees that a national spiritual assembly should have in order to carry out its responsibilities
indirect election referred to the process mentioned in the will and testament of abdu l bah of the bah s electing one or more delegates from each locality who would represent them at a national convention and would vote for the nine members of the national spiritual assembly
the issue of the bah world listed nine national spiritual assemblies persia iran the united states and canada germany great britain and ireland india and burma egypt turkistan caucasus and iraq
of these the iranian body was still the central spiritual assembly in tehran elected by the bah s of that community it was not until that a national bah membership list could be drawn up that allowed the election of delegates and convening of a fully representative national convention
it is possible that the turkistan and caucasus bodies were preliminary as well
by the number of national spiritual assemblies worldwide had increased to in by by by
an important part of the process was the establishment of regional national spiritual assemblies thus in all of south america elected a single national spiritual assembly but by nearly every nation on that continent had its own
national spiritual assemblies are still being formed as areas of the world achieve religious freedom
some national spiritual assemblies have been formed in areas smaller than a nation alaska hawaii and puerto rico have their own national bodies because they are geographically separated from the lower forty eight states sicily has its own because shoghi effendi said major islands also like in the caribbean should elect independent national spiritual assemblies
like local spiritual assemblies all national spiritual assemblies have nine members and are elected annually usually during the ridv n festival april may
all bah elections occur in an atmosphere of prayer where nominations campaigning and all discussion of persons is forbidden
the members of the national spiritual assemblies collectively serve as the electoral college for electing the universal house of justice the supreme governing body of the bah faith which was first formed in
