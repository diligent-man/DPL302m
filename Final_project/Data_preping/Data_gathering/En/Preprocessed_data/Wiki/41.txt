Spiritual Assembly is a term given by ʻAbdu'l-Bah to refer to elected councils that govern the Bahʼ Faith
Because the Bahʼ Faith has no clergy they carry out the affairs of the community
In addition to existing at the local level there are national Spiritual Assemblies although national in some cases refers to a portion of a country or to a group of countries
Spiritual Assemblies form part of the elected branch of the Bahʼ administration
Bahʼu'llh ʻAbdu'l-Bah and Shoghi Effendi stated how Spiritual Assemblies should be elected by the Bahʼs defined their nature and purposes and described in considerable detail how they should function
Since these institutions are grounded in the Bahʼ authoritative texts Bahʼs regard them as divine in nature and contrast the wealth of scriptural guidance with the paucity of scriptural texts on which Jewish Christian and Islamic religious institutions are based
The Universal House of Justice has added that among the responsibilities of Local Spiritual Assemblies are to be channels of divine guidance planners of the teaching work developers of human resources builders of communities and loving shepherds of the multitudes On a practical level they organize local Bahʼ communities by maintaining a local Bahʼ Fund owning the local Bahʼ center if one exists organizing Bahʼ events counseling Bahʼs about personal difficulties assisting with Bahʼ marriages and funerals providing educational programs to adults and children publicizing the Bahʼ Faith locally fostering projects for the social and economic development of the region and enrolling new members of the religion
Spiritual Assemblies appoint individuals task forces and committees to carry out many of their functions
National Spiritual Assemblies have a similar mandate at the national level they coordinate publishing and distribution of Bahʼ literature direct relations with national organizations and governmental agencies oversee the work of local spiritual assemblies and in some countries Regional Councils set local Bahʼ jurisdictional boundaries provide various educational services and programs and set the overall tone and direction of the national community
The origin of the institution of the local Spiritual Assembly originates from Bahʼu'llh's book of laws the Kitb-i-Aqdas
The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of Baha and should it exceed this number it doth not matter
They should consider themselves as entering the Court of the presence of God the Exalted the Most High and as beholding Him Who is the Unseen
It behoveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth
It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God for His sake even as they regard their own interests and to choose that which is meet and seemlyThe passage gives the institution a name a minimum number nine for the number of Baha refers to the numerical value of the letters of that word which is nine and a general responsibility to take care of the welfare of others even as they would take care of their own
While the resulting institution is local in the Kitb-i-Aqdas Bahʼu'llh also spoke about the responsibilities of the supreme or Universal House of Justice
In response to the passage Mrz Asadu'llh Isfahn a prominent Bahʼ teacher organized an unofficial Bahʼ consultative body in Tehran Iran about
The first official Bahʼ consultative body was organized under ʻAbdu'l-Bah's direction by Hand of the Cause Haj khnd in Tehran in by it was an elected body
Because of the difficulties in Iran caused by persecution of the Bahʼ Faith the Tehran body served to coordinate both local and national Bahʼ activities
It is not known what name the body was organized under
The development of a Bahʼ community in the United States in the s necessitated the creation of local Bahʼ consultative bodies there
In the Bahʼs of Chicago elected a local council based on their awareness of the provisions of the Kitb-i-Aqdas which was circulated in provisional English translation as a typescript as early as
The New York Bahʼs elected a Board of Counsel in December
In the Chicago body was reorganized and re-elected and took the name House of Justice of Bahais of Chicago Ills In response ʻAbdu'l-Bah revealed three tablets of encouragement and guidance to the body including prayers to say at the beginning and end of their meetings prayers that Bahʼs use around the world today for their Spiritual Assembly meetings
In ʻAbdu'l-Bah sent a very important tablet to the Chicago governing body where he said let the designation of that body be 'Spiritual Assembly'—this for the reason that were it to use the term 'House of Justice' the government might hereafter come to suppose that it was acting as a court of law or concerning itself in political matters or that at some indeterminate future time it would involve itself in the affairs of government
This same designation hath been universally adopted throughout Iran For this reason Bahʼ local and national governing bodies are designated Spiritual Assemblies to this day
The first decade of the twentieth century saw the proliferation of local Bahʼ governing bodies
Often unaware of ʻAbdu'l-Bah's guidance they had a variety of titles in English and Persian such as Council Board Board of Consultation House of Spirituality and Executive Committee Unaware ʻAbdu'l-Bah had told the Chicago Bahʼs to elect their body every five years they were usually elected annually or even semi-annually
The number of members varied from five to nineteen except in New York City where ʻAbdu'l-Bah in said they should elect twenty-seven members in order to be inclusive of and to foster unity between that city's diverse Bahʼ groups
They were male only until ʻAbdu'l-Bah said in that women should be elected to the local governing bodies existing in the United States their exclusion from local bodies continued in Iran until the s because of Iranian cultural conventions
In the period of - consultative bodies are known to have existed in Kenosha Wisconsin Boston Massachusetts Washington DC Spokane Washington northern Hudson County New Jersey the greater San Francisco area California in the United States and in Bombay British Raj India Cairo Khedivate of Egypt Acre Ottoman Syria Baku Tbilisi Ashgabat and Samarqand in the Russian Empire and Mashhad Abadih Qazvin and Tabriz Persia
Consultative bodies also existed for the Jewish and Zoroastrian Bahʼs in Tehran and for the women of a few Bahʼ communities
Because efforts to organize local Bahʼ consultative bodies remained informal few additional ones had formed by notable exceptions being Cleveland Ohio and London and some of the ones in the United States had lapsed
Upon assuming the Guardianship of the Bahʼ Faith Shoghi Effendi read ʻAbdu'l-Bah's Will and Testament and made establishment of local spiritual assemblies an early priority
His second general letter to the Bahʼs of the world dated March referred to the vital necessity of having a local Spiritual Assembly in every locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine The letter also quoted extensively from Bahʼu'llh and ʻAbdu'l-Bah about the purposes and duties of Spiritual Assemblies
The result was a rapid proliferation of local Spiritual Assemblies a list had the following Australia Brazil Burma Canada China Egypt England France India Japan Korea Lebanon New Zealand Palestine Iran Russia South Africa Switzerland Syria Turkey and the United States for a total of local Spiritual Assemblies worldwide
The number has grown ever since in there were local Spiritual Assemblies worldwide
National Spiritual Assemblies are first mentioned in ʻAbdu'l-Bah's Will and Testament but the fact that they would be established circulated for years before the contents of the Will became publicly available in early
In Hippolyte Dreyfus fr wrote extensively about the role of the national House of Justice as it would have been known then in his The Universal Religion Bahaism Its Rise and Social Import
In that year also the Bahʼs of the United States and Canada elected a nine-member Executive Committee for the Bahai Temple Unity a continental consultative body formed to build the Bahʼ House of Worship in Wilmette Illinois a suburb of Chicago
Subsequently the Bahai Temple Unity which held annual conventions appointed committees to publish Bahʼ literature coordinate the spread of the Bahʼ Faith across North America and review Bahʼ publications for their accuracy
By the time of ʻAbdu'l-Bah's passing in November the Bahai Temple Unity functioned as a national Bahʼ coordinating body
In the same March letter to the Bahʼs of the world that called for the election of local Spiritual Assemblies Shoghi Effendi called on them to indirectly elect National Spiritual Assemblies
He also enumerated committees that a National Spiritual Assembly should have in order to carry out its responsibilities
Indirect election referred to the process mentioned in the Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bah of the Bahʼs electing one or more delegates from each locality who would represent them at a national convention and would vote for the nine members of the National Spiritual Assembly
The issue of The Bahʼ World listed nine National Spiritual Assemblies Persia Iran the United States and Canada Germany Great Britain and Ireland India and Burma Egypt Turkistan Caucasus and Iraq
Of these the Iranian body was still the Central Spiritual Assembly in Tehran elected by the Bahʼs of that community it was not until that a national Bahʼ membership list could be drawn up that allowed the election of delegates and convening of a fully representative national convention
It is possible that the Turkistan and Caucasus bodies were preliminary as well
By the number of National Spiritual Assemblies worldwide had increased to in by by by
An important part of the process was the establishment of regional National Spiritual Assemblies thus in all of South America elected a single National Spiritual Assembly but by nearly every nation on that continent had its own
National Spiritual Assemblies are still being formed as areas of the world achieve religious freedom
Some National Spiritual Assemblies have been formed in areas smaller than a nation Alaska Hawaii and Puerto Rico have their own national bodies because they are geographically separated from the lower forty-eight states Sicily has its own because Shoghi Effendi said major islands also like in the Caribbean should elect independent National Spiritual Assemblies
Like local Spiritual Assemblies all National Spiritual Assemblies have nine members and are elected annually usually during the Ridvn Festival April -May
All Bahʼ elections occur in an atmosphere of prayer where nominations campaigning and all discussion of persons is forbidden
The members of the National Spiritual Assemblies collectively serve as the electoral college for electing the Universal House of Justice the supreme governing body of the Bahʼ Faith which was first formed in
