Maurice Le Noblet Duplessis QC French pronunciation ​dyplɛsi April September was a French Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the th premier of Quebec
A conservative nationalist anti-Communist anti-unionist and fervent Catholic he and his party the Union Nationale dominated provincial politics from the s to the s
Son of Nre Duplessis a lawyer who was serving at the time as a Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly MLA Maurice studied law in Montreal and became a member of the Bar of Quebec in
He then returned to his home town to practice law where he founded a successful consultancy
Duplessis ran as a Conservative candidate in the elections but only managed to get the Trois-Rivires seat four years later which he retained until his death
His rhetorical skills helped him become the leader of the Official Opposition in the Legislative Assembly in in the place of Camillien Houde
As opposition leader he agreed to a coalition with Paul Gouin's Action librale nationale ALN a breakaway faction of former Liberal MLAs of which he quickly became the most prominent member
The first attempt in to oust Louis-Alexandre Taschereau then solidly in power for years failed
Duplessis however won in a landslide the following year when the ALN merged with the Conservatives to form the Union Nationale which Duplessis would lead until his death
The election broke the dominance of the Quebec Liberal Party it held uninterruptedly for almost years
The first government of Maurice Duplessis lasted for just over three years
It was then that Duplessis became the president of the Bar of Quebec btonnier becoming the only person in Quebec to be attorney general premier and president of the Bar at the same time
He was defeated by Liberal Adlard Godbout in the election when his bid to underline Quebec's opposition to World War II failed but the same opposition as expressed in the Canadian conscription plebiscite and the Conscription Crisis that followed returned him to power following the election
His second stint as premier lasted for fifteen years and spanned four legislatures
He is the longest-serving premier of Quebec since Confederation and the last one to have consecutively served more than ten years
His leadership was only interrupted by his death in September due to intracranial bleeding
Duplessis was a proponent of economic liberalism obstructing the efforts of the federal government to conduct Keynesian policies
While his first term saw the introduction of several key welfare policies such as the universal minimum wage and old-age pensions Duplessis viewed the welfare state unfavourably in particular by resisting calls to expand social programmes in the post-war period
In his second period of premiership he presided over a period of strong economic growth notably due to the development of the Cte-Nord and rural areas
Duplessis implemented pro-business policies which his opponents say led to wild capitalism and a clientelist relationship with business interests
The leader of Union Nationale also opposed the increasingly powerful trade unions and fought against communism by adopting laws such as the Padlock Law
Duplessis while not a sovereigntist repeatedly asserted provincial autonomy
He also strongly protected the traditional role of the Catholic Church in Quebec's society notably in healthcare and education engaged in persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses and resisted non-conservative tendencies in the society
This coupled with his authoritarian grip of the province and what was widely seen to be an anachronistic model of society Duplessis was promoting led his critics to label the period as the Grande Noirceur Great Darkness
While this opinion is still present some narratives are challenging the perception providing more nuance to the portrait of the Duplessism whose social and economical legacy was largely undone in the s with the Quiet Revolution
Scholars have traced Duplessis's roots back to the sixth generation
Jean-Baptiste Duplessis was a Mascouten slave of a noble called Louis Gatineau-Duplessis
He probably took the last and first names from Louis's brother Jean-Baptiste who became a godfather during the slave's christening in in Detroit
Therefore contrary to some suggestions Maurice Duplessis was not a descendant of Guillaume Guillemot Du Plessis-Kebodot one of the earliest governors of Trois-Rivires
The connection between Jean-Baptiste Duplessis and Louis Gatineau-Duplessis is uncertain
Earlier works particularly Franois-Svre Lesieur Dsaulniers's book on the genealogy of families in Yamachiche say Gatineau-Duplessis was his father but newer scholarship dismisses this theory as implausible stating instead that the slave might have had some family relationship with Louis Gatineau-Duplessis but certainly not a paternal one
It is also unclear why the Mascouten man took the nickname Le Noblet but it stuck to his descendants
One of his children Isidore settled in Pointe-du-Lac today part of Trois-Rivires and all of Duplessis family from the paternal side have stayed in the area either in that settlement or in nearby Yamachiche
Maurice Le Noblet Duplessis was born on April in Trois-Rivires to a religious family of modest means
He was the second child and only son of Nre Le Noblet Duplessis a member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec for Saint-Maurice
Maurice's father was a kind but busy man and spent little time with the family which was however expected at the time
Two of Nre's sisters married politicians who would also sit in the Legislative Assembly
Maurice's mother was Berthe Genest who had Scottish and Irish origins on her maternal side
Emma's Anglo-Saxon roots made the future premier well-disposed to Anglophones Duplessis would even joke that he was one of them
At the end of the th century the Duplessis family of Trois-Rivires was active in the political and religious life of the region and the members of the family could often be found among conservative and ultramontanist sympathizers with whom they would often debate current political events
Some of the influential figures of the time including Louis-Olivier Taillon Edmund James Flynn Joseph-Mathias Tellier Louis-Philippe Pelletier and Thomas Chapais could be found there
In addition to that Maurice's father a deeply pious person maintained close relations with Louis-Franois Richer Laflche the bishop of the Diocese of Trois-Rivires where he worked as legal counsel
The bishop supported his electoral bid for the Saint-Maurice seat in which Nre won
Maurice was born during his father's reelection campaign who chose to name his son for the electoral district he was the MLA for
The newborn boy was then baptized by Laflche himselfIn Duplessis left his home city to study at the Collge Notre-Dame in Montreal which was run by the Congregation of Holy Cross
There he met Andr Bessette better known as Brother Andr then porter of the college who came to like young Duplessis and handed him over the task of finding students willing to talk with the rector
The relationship was so close that it was then that Duplessis developed the cult of Saint Joseph which he carried for the rest of his life and which sometimes influenced his political choices
The future premier was a bright student excelling in French history Latin and philosophy at the same time he was known to be playful and sometimes mischievous
He would often play tricks on his school friends and also on their sisters hiding their clothes and pillows readjusting the beds so that they would fall when someone lay down on them and throwing water buckets small pastries buns and other projectiles
In Duplessis moved to the Sminaire de Trois-Rivires in order to pursue his study in a classical college
Maurice continued to excel in other subjects including history theology Latin and Greek which helped him become the best student in his year but in particular sharpened his rhetorical skills while attending the debate club at the college's Saint Thomas Aquinas Society
Maurice would make what Conrad Black described as long apologetic speeches about the founders of French Canada that were as extravagant as they were unconvincing where he would show his attachment to and admiration of his roots and the Catholic faith
He was especially fond of Louis Hbert one of the first colonizers of the New France and a pioneer of farming in the area which Black suggests was a sign that he already had a deep affection for the rural lifestyle at this stage particularly given that he spent the summer with his grandfather in Yamachiche
Duplessis's interest for politics appeared at a very young age
Maurice would memorize the circumstances and dates of important events in the politics of Canada and of Quebec as well as the regional differences in voting patterns in the province
As early as at the age of ten Maurice was already engaging in political meetings and was speaking with the voters and he would also follow his father during his electoral campaigns and meetings across the electoral region thus showing more interest in the practical aspects of politics than in its theory
Later in his adolescence the future premier was preparing for public life by working in a political organisation of Joseph-Arthur Barrette a Conservative MP for Berthier
When finishing school Maurice Duplessis felt attracted to public life while at the same time he was equally devoted to the Catholic Church due to the influence of Brother Andr
However Maurice felt that being a religious minister bore too many constraints
He confided to his secretary a few years later that the priesthood was too much for me He was not interested to pursue a business career either because as Black suggested he knew the English were greatly advantaged
In the meantime a wave of increased interest in politics engulfed Quebec at the beginning of th century with the popularity of figures like Henri Bourassa and Wilfrid Laurier being felt across the province which did not bypass Trois-Rivires or Duplessis
Strongly influenced by the family and by the uptick in engagement in political matters he decided to go in his father's footsteps
Thus in autumn of he enrolled in the faculty of law at the Universit Laval in Montreal which is now a separate university called Universit de Montral
Pursuing a law degree was then a standard way to get into politics
While studying he was noted for his liveliness sharp responses and socializing
Duplessis sitting in the opposition was a local star within the model parliament organized by the university
The future premier of Quebec before practising law trained in the offices of Rodolphe Monty et Alfred Duranleau two nationalist conservatives and friends of Duplessis's family where Maurice was referred to by his father Nre
After three years of studies Duplessis was admitted to the Bar of Quebec on September
Maurice returned to his home town to practice law at the Bar of Trois-Rivires fr whose member he would stay until his death
He first worked for a short time together with his father before Nre Duplessis was nominated as judge of the Superior Court of Quebec on June
The future Premier then opened his own consultancy Duplessis Langlois Lamothe Avocats et Procureurs on Hart Street behind his parents' house together with douard Langlois an old friend of his from the Sminaire who became husband of Duplessis's sister Gabrielle and another lawyer from Trois-Rivires Lon Lamothe
The partnership of these lawyers lasted at least until the early s
Practising civil law more than criminal law Duplessis developed his large client base among the ordinary people who were attracted due to his arguments in court that often proved persuasive
He was quickly recognized as a sociable and competent lawyer who approached his cases carefully and thus became a popular figure in the town
The young lawyer engaged in the activities of his area notably taking care of a local baseball team and became a fixture in high-end taverns of his town
His professional success briefly interrupted by the death of his mother in let him buy a personal Winton on a loan to great dismay of his father
Despite a promising career start in his legal profession Duplessis did not lose sight from his political ambitions
He made his first attempt to get to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in when he became a Conservative candidate for the riding of Trois-Rivires seeking to oust the incumbent Liberal MLA Louis-Philippe Mercier
Mercier benefited from a well-organized political structure in the area directed by his mentor Jacques Bureau who at the time served as a member of Parliament for Three Rivers and St
Maurice and the federal minister of customs and excise
Maurice counted on the solidarity of his fellow lawyers the good reputation among his clients as well as his father's acquaintances' support notably Louis-Olivier Taillon some of whom came over to make speeches in Duplessis's favour
His campaign focused on the criticism of what Duplessis alleged was Premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau's contempt towards provincial autonomy and towards municipal rights while also speaking against the Liberals' management of the judiciary
Despite a rather close race Maurice lost to the incumbent with votes for Duplessis and for Mercier
Duplessis at the time did not expect to win the riding anyway but instead hoped that his good showing would make him a good candidate of the opposition leader in the region
Duplessis attempted a second run to the Legislative Assembly trying to get as much support from working- and middle-class families as he could including by paying personal visits to them and tracking his opponent's moves during Mercier's another four years in office his resolve to get to the provincial parliament increased even further after his father died in
Despite a dismal showing of the Conservatives in the election where they only managed to capture out of seats Duplessis eked out a victory of to votes in a rematch against Mercier and flipped the Trois-Rivires seat previously considered a Liberal stronghold for the first time in years
In his victory speech he prophetically declared that you have in front of you the future premier of Quebec
At the time when Duplessis was elected the Legislative Assembly was only in session for two months in a year which allowed Duplessis to spend more time in his electoral district
Duplessis became immediately active on the parliament floor once the session started on January
In a speech from January the Legislative Assembly freshman made a speech where he decried the overemphasis on industrial development as opposed to rural and small-business interests called to stop increasing taxes and to respect the religious nature of Sundays and proposed to make an inventory of the forest industry it was suspected at the time that the resources were being overexploited and to reorganize the provincial police
The first speech left Premier Taschereau impressed who reportedly remarked that this young man will go far
His rhetorical skills and the knowledge of the law on the books made him a rising star in the opposition
When Arthur Sauv left the leadership of the Conservatives it was even supposed that Duplessis could take the steers of the battered party but at the time Duplessis was not ready yet
Camillien Houde Mayor of Montreal was nominated instead but he often had to leave the parliament sessions because of his other demanding job so Duplessis whom the Conservative caucus already saw as a safe alternative to Houde should his policies fail was able to informally lead the caucus in the leader's absence
Arthur Sauv in his resignation speech asked his successor to reestablish order in our ravaged ranks
Even though the new leader liked Duplessis the future premier did not particularly trust Houde's organizational capabilities finding him an impetuous and verbose braggart
He also said to his party colleague Antonio Barrette who would serve briefly as Premier in You will see Houde climb to the top of the hill only for him to go down on the other slope
Conrad Black characterized his relationship with Houde together with his political views in the following way
Later events seemed to confirm Duplessis's intuition
In the election the Conservatives were again resoundingly defeated with only seats out of in the party's hands despite the fact that the Conservatives got a markedly larger share of votes provincially
Houde lost his own riding while Duplessis got barely reelected with a razor-thin margin of votes for Duplessis versus for Louis-Philippe Bigu his Liberal challenger
Upon learning the results Taschereau declared that this outcome means the end of Houdism
The election has seen the Conservatives internal strife already present in Sauv years intensify
The party members could not even agree to a common strategy of dealing with the results of the election
Houde opted for a recount in ridings won by Liberals alleging widespread electoral fraud Duplessis however was among a group of dissident MLAs who refused to endorse Houde's idea with Duplessis particularly being afraid that his narrow victory would be overturned
The plan was frustrated by the governing Liberals who passed legislation requiring that C equivalent to in be paid for each contested riding
In an effort to appease the Anglophone community Houde designated an ageing Charles Ernest Gault a Houde ally and long-time MLA from MontralSaint-Georges as a new leader of the parliamentary caucus
The choice enraged Duplessis who was a rising star in his party
Houde also nominated Gault as leader of the Conservatives after he lost his mayorship and resigned from the leadership of the party on September but the Conservative caucus overrode that decision on November and put Duplessis in charge
The decision was formally confirmed during a party congress in Sherbrooke on October when Duplessis was confirmed in his position getting votes against cast for Onsime Gagnon an MLA from Dorchester who favoured closer ties with the federal Conservatives
Duplessis received support from seven out of MLAs from his party as well as all federal ministers from Quebec with the exception of Maurice Dupr who was a law partner of Gagnon
While Duplessis got less support from the Anglophones due to him being perceived as too nationalist Richard Jones argues that it was the superior organisation and not the nationalist rhetoric that secured Maurice's victory
Despite the victory the tensions within the Conservative caucus did not subside
The news of the election of the new leader was received well in Trois-Rivires and Quebec City
Duplessis met with Cardinal Jean-Marie-Rodrigue Villeneuve Anglican bishop Williams Henry George Carroll the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec as well as the mayor of Quebec City Henri-Edgar Lavigueur
On the other hand Camillien Houde was angered by the choice of his party's caucus
He bitterly declared that either I will perish or they Duplessis supporters will and said that he was free to associate myself with any serious movement that will try to get us rid of two political parties in Quebec that perpetuate the idea that the power trumps the law
Houde would only reconcile with Duplessis in
Duplessis immediately engaged in his new job
In his response to Taschereau's speech from the throne Duplessis harshly criticized the management of the province in particular pointing to the overcapitalization of companies chaos in the province's industry and resource exploitation and what he saw as unjust treatment of the municipalities unnecessary confrontations with the federal government the lack of respect for traditions and pandering too much to big business interests instead of developing rural areas
Unlike some of his other colleagues in the party centered around Aim Guertin however he opposed trust-busting in order to increase the clout of French-Canadian businesses and saw unfavourably the advocacy of some of his party colleagues to overhaul the social welfare system
Despite the differences within the opposition the governing Liberals had even more problems
Quebec was in the midst of the Great Depression which left Canada's economy declining
The Liberal Party then in power for more than years was suffering from internal tensions too but also from the laissez-faire economic policies that proved inadequate for the crisis and what Conrad Black described as inflexibility and population's weariness of the government that has been in power for too long
As a result some of the Liberal MLAs became disillusioned with Taschereau and created a new party the Action librale nationale ALN
The new party which in particular despised the big business's interests in the province consisted of nationalist and progressive MLAs led by Paul Gouin and included some other figures such as Philippe Hamel Joseph-Ernest Grgoire and Oscar Drouin
The members of the new political force drew heavily from the Programme de restauration sociale a social policy document drafted by the Catholic clergy in that advocated corporatism as an alternative for capitalism and communism and sought to improve the position of French Canadians in the province by expanding the social welfare net breaking and if needed nationalizing trusts and revitalizing rural areas
In particular the party was critical of the energy trusts and sought to bring the hydroelectricity companies under state control
The New Deal policies adopted south of the Canadian border had also some impact on ALN's ideology
Initially Maurice Duplessis was skeptical of the third political force saying that two parties are enough the good one and the bad one
He was then preparing for the upcoming election starting a tour across the province more than a year before the voters were to go to the ballots
On June Duplessis visited the Antonio lie a fellow deputy from Yamaska and an award-winning breeder of foxes where he delivered a speech underlining his attachment to the traditions and distrust of the modern and urban life
He also attacked the presence of foreign economic interests in the province accusing Taschereau of supporting supermarkets with tax credits while leaving independent shop owners vulnerable to bankruptcy and by leaving the extraction of natural resources in the hands of foreign capital which he argued let them be used against Quebeckers
These arguments echoed those made by the ALN whose strength was amplified by Duplessis's incessant attacks on the government even if Duplessis tried to assure that honest capital would remain untouched in the province and that they were less extreme than the maverick Liberals
Maurice remained distrustful of the ALN members seeing them as unreliable men who would join the Liberals after the election and ruin his dream of heading the government himself and warned his fellow party colleagues to stay away from ALN advances even when publicly he encouraged all sincere Liberals to join forces
Despite Oscar Drouin's call to Duplessis to unite in their quest to overturn the Taschereau government the federal Conservatives' crushing defeat in the federal election in October a prospect of three-headed race in the first-past-the-post system that would cause vote splitting issues and finally Taschereau's decision to call a snap election on November in a bid to capitalize on an electoral success of the federal Liberals in Quebec Duplessis remained opposed to any agreement with the breakaway Liberals
However faced with overwhelming support of a coalition within his party and donors' and organizers' threats to withhold resources if the Conservatives did not sign a coalition agreement Duplessis was forced to sign one on November
According to the agreement a so-called Union Nationale coalition was formed each riding had only one candidate from the opposition but two-thirds of ridings were signed off to the ALN members and all opposition candidates ran on ALN's platform which was declared to be identical to the Conservatives' if the Union Nationale won Duplessis given his experience would become Premier but Gouin would choose the majority of his cabinet
The coalition failed to displace the Liberals from power who got elected in out of ridings just enough for the majority but fewer than in and fewer than just before the election
As for the opposition the Conservatives managed to win ridings the best result since while the ALN got MLAs
Duplessis got reelected with a safe margin of out of votes in total
The charisma and ardour of Duplessis in contrast to the temperate behaviour of Paul Gouin would strongly influence the MLAs from the Action librale nationale and a lot of them would co-create the new merged party of the same name as the coalition
Maurice Duplessis continued his offensive when the new parliamentary session opened
In spring Duplessis managed to call the parliamentary public accounts committee to start an inquiry into the management of public funds by the Taschereau government in which Duplessis would place himself as prosecutor
Numerous irregularities were uncovered where various Liberal government officials acknowledged having used the public money inappropriately
For example Antoine Taschereau premier's brother and accountant of the Quebec Legislature was forced to resign when he admitted having pocketed interest from the government's bank deposits
Duplessis even capitalized on the seemingly trivial infractions such as when Irne Vautrin ex-minister of colonization fr confessed that he had bought trousers on his ministry's money only to promptly denounce this as a symbol of the corruption of the Taschereau government
The fact that the newspapers reported on all the smallest details of the inquiry made the committee job a political goldmine for Duplessis
As a result of such revelations Taschereau resigned on June and handed over the premiership to Adlard Godbout who was forced to call an election on August that year
The political situation during that year changed dramatically
Even though Duplessis entered the election as a junior coalition partner his charisma rhetorical skills and his grilling of the Liberal officials has earned him support from most of ALN deputies Gouin on the other hand proved not to be a good leader of the opposition and even handed over most of coalition matters to Duplessis because of the latter's expertise in politics
On the organizational level the Conservatives succeeded in capturing the Union Nationale brand for them
Moreover the corruption inquiry severely weakened the governing party which gave Duplessis a chance to single-handedly win the premiership
Therefore on June Duplessis announced his refusal to renew the coalition agreement even though the election writs were already issued
The leader of the Conservatives was quickly able to force an increase of the proportion of Conservative ridings in the coalition from one-third to two-thirds but the next day Gouin decided to break with Duplessis and started campaigning independently against the other two parties
Gouin's bid attracted little support as out of Union Nationale coalition MLAs who came to a caucus meeting in Sherbrooke backed Duplessis's takeover of the coalition and most of ALN's members joined Duplessis and the newly created Union Nationale party
Eventually Gouin said he would not field any candidates in any ridings due to his temporary retirement from politics which confirmed Duplessis's leadership
The Union Nationale made an electoral campaign along similar lines to the election formalizing that in a pamphlet called Le Catchisme des lecteurs designed in a question-and-answer format to address the contemporary political and economical issues while also adding attacks on corruption
Duplessis successfully tied Godbout to the deeply unpopular Taschereau and rallied massive support for his political appearances
When the voters came to the polls they delivered a landslide victory for the Duplessis's party handing out of seats and ending the Liberal rule over Quebec that lasted for years
The first government of Maurice Duplessis was formed in peculiar circumstances
The Union Nationale at the time was far from a monolith party as it included both former ALN and Conservative members
Onsime Gagnon Duplessis's challenger in the Conservative leadership contest was appointed Minister of Mines Hunting and Fisheries and four former Liberals received their ministerial seats however Philippe Hamel one of the main ideologues of the late Action librale nationale was not offered a position in the provincial cabinet
Among other consequences of the election Camillien Houde who had a feud with Duplessis unexpectedly decided to resign from his mayorship of Montreal citing bad relations with the new Premier despite a looming election three months later Houde lost it to a candidate favoured by the Union Nationale
Duplessis quickly became conflicted with his minister of roads Franois Leduc who was deeply critical of his being forced to cooperate with business interests of the friends of the party
Leduc however refused to resign himself so Duplessis who accused the minister of roads of various abuses decided to request the Lieutenant Governor to dismiss the whole government only to secretly assemble it later from the same members but without the recalcitrant minister—the first time ever since Confederation that a premier used this method to fire a government member
Maurice has also seen a group of five people led by Philippe Hamel and which also included Oscar Drouin Ernest Grgoire Ren Chaloult and Adolphe Marcoux quit the Union Nationale altogether and found a short-lived Parti National after he failed to keep up on his electoral pledges to fend off foreign capital
He thus assumed the interim positions of the minister of roads and minister of lands and forests after Leduc and Drouin left the government
The Premier of Quebec at the same time held some top positions related to his law career
After receiving the honorary title of King's Counsel on December due to his achievements in the field of law he appointed himself attorney general of Quebec for the whole duration of all his terms
In addition to that he was elected President btonnier fr of the Bar of Quebec and President of the Bar of Trois-Rivires for the term which in addition to conferring prestige to the Premier gave him some influence over the internal order of the bar
This was the only case in Quebec when the top prosecutorial position the top government position and the top lawyers' self-government position were all held by one personDuring his speech from the Throne Duplessis emphasized that his priority was giving advantage to the human capital over money capital
He announced four measures seeking to implement his agenda creation of the Farm Credit Bureau abolition the so-called Dillon law which was adopted to restrict the possibility of challenging election results adoption of an old-age pension program together with the federal government and enhancement of the law on workplace accidents as well as a ban on ministers to sit on corporate boards of directors
In particular the rural loan program which Duplessis instituted due to his conviction that agriculture still constituted the main locomotive of economic progress in the province proved extremely popular in the countryside which the new party exploited to the full and which according to Michel Sarra-Bournet was the main factor of Union Nationale's longevity
This was however where the similarities with the electoral pledges ended
Despite assurances that he would reform the economy the policies he pursued largely mirrored those of the Liberals his party had just deposed
He also opened the province to more foreign capital notably to Robert R
McCormick an American media mogul and outspoken critic of the New Deal policies who built a new paper plant in Baie-Comeau
Duplessis also resented nationalization of hydroelectric plants as some ALN members proposed while the Union Nationale was still a coalition
This attracted accusations of hypocrisy from his adversaries but even some members of his own party were not content either seeing this as selling off Quebec to the foreigners
As a result five MLAs left his party due to this about-face
The condition of Quebec's economy did not improve during his term due to the reverbations of the Great Depression which however Duplessis blamed on Ottawa for what he said was an artificial restriction of the province's borrowing power
Public debt ballooned from million to million during his three years in power C to C in dollars and the tempo of the emission of obligations during his first term exceeded that of all of prior administrations since Confederation
It prompted Ottawa to control the province's borrowing which Duplessis decried as an invasion on fiscal autonomy of the province
His social welfare record in the first term was somewhat progressive
Old-age pensions and workplace accident protections were instituted during his first year in office as were some public works projects such as the completion of the Montreal Botanical Garden
The Union Nationale was the first Quebec cabinet to include the Ministry of Health and it also financed the new Institute of Microbiology and Hygiene of Montreal fr a research facility similar to Paris's Pasteur Institute
In line with the Church's teaching Duplessis gave assistance to needy mothers but not to unwed divorced or separated women as well as to the blind and the orphaned
Duplessis adopted the Fair Wage Act French Loi des salaires raisonnables and created the Fair Wage Board
It was the first time the minimum wage in Quebec was available for all workers it only previously applied to women but the legislation was marred by reticence of the trade unions to embrace the scheme they preferred collective bargaining instead which led to agreements that were not regulated by the Fair Wage Act by the government's liberal application of the law and the proliferation of often arbitrary decisions of the Board
Despite an increase of minimum wages above Ontario levels almost a fifth of workers were not paid the mandated wages in suggesting its rather weak enforcement
Duplessis additionally banned closed shop arrangements and outlawed the practice where the employers fired employees only to return them to work with a lower salary
The latter policy however created perverse incentives as the companies increasingly stopped negotiating with the workers and were bypassing the trade unions while asking for government assistance during thestrikes
This was the case with the Dominion Textile strike in August and another one in a shipyard in Sorel when Duplessis who saw the protests as unfortunate and unjustified ordered workers to return to work before starting negotiations the Confdration des travailleurs catholiques du Canada CTCC eventually secured with government's mediation a short-term agreement
Most historians largely agree that favouritism and clientelism were one of the defining features of Maurice Duplessis's reign over the province
The premier himself did not particularly hide from it eg
by telling people in the ridings that had not yet elected an Union Nationale representative that if the constituents would like some sort of investment in their area they would have to show him this on election day
Even if Duplessis personally did not enrich himself by this means the party he led did not hesitate to fill its coffers by contributions from businesses to which it would return favours once in power
It was largely due to these donations that the Union Nationale managed to conduct well-financed electoral campaigns
Duplessis being a deeply devout person he regularly engaged with the Catholic Church officials
Duplessis strongly enticed them to support him by making numerous symbolic moves
For instance when Brother Andr whom he met in his elementary school in Montreal died on January he had a mausoleum built in his honour
The following year in his opening speech to the National Eucharistic Congress in Quebec City Duplessis stressed he did not accept the ideas coming from the French Revolution and underlined his Catholic faith
In addition to that he also introduced the crucifix to the debate hall of the Legislative Assembly
This could have been a nod to his father's ultramontanism but it was more probably a continuation of Taschereau's policies who introduced a universal prayer in and ordered to place crucifixes in Quebec courtrooms
At the same time the premier did not intend to give as much power to the clergy it had under Taschereau throwing the Church out of the lawmaking process related to social and moral issues it used to have access to
In fact only part of the clergy supported Duplessis and many more preferred Parti National's manifestos
The defining feature of his first term was the fierce opposition to Communism something that would persist in later terms too
Duplessis said that the Communism must be considered the top public enemy despised and to be despised
In line with his ideas and with unanimous support of the Liberals the Union Nationale enacted the Act to Protect the Province Against Communistic Propaganda better known as the Padlock Law which allowed the Attorney General ie
Duplessis to prosecute people propagating Bolshevism or Communism not defined in the law on private or public property and banned any publications advocating or trying to advocate the ideologies
It could be arbitrarily used against trade unions and the clergy Duplessis personally did not like and the law provided no appeal to those expropriated
The law received positive reactions from the general public as well as the clergy but was fiercely criticized in the Anglophone press which tied its enaction with Cardinal Villeneuve's supposed undue influence on the government
It was only struck down in by the Supreme Court of Canada in Switzman v Elbling as an infringement on federal government's powers to pass criminal statutes
Another issue of his government was the approaching of World War II and conscription-related issues
On the one hand Duplessis tried to assure George VI of his province's loyalty towards the Crown during the king's visit in May but on the other many French Canadians had the conscription crisis of fresh in their minds
Therefore Duplessis together with his aides decided to make use of the electorate's distrust of federal war plans and general anti-war attitude of Quebeckers to announce a snap election hoping to catch the Liberals by surprise and persuading the electorate that the conscription was a means to take over provincial competences
The effort did not succeed however as the provincial Liberals also announced their opposition to conscription as did Camillien Houde and some members of the Union Nationale including Wilbrod Rousseau and Adhmar Raynault finally William Mackenzie King the Prime Minister of Canada declared that no one would be drafted to the army by force particularly as three French Canadian ministers in King's government threatened to resign in case of Duplessis's reelection which would give way to supporters of conscription
At the same time the Liberals pointed to the bad state of the economy
The election was disastrous for the Union Nationale it only received of votes but more importantly it got out of seats losing the premiership to Adlard Godbout
The defeat of the Union Nationale met Duplessis's leadership in danger
Some of his fellow MLAs were mad at his starting the election in an unfortunate moment
Joseph-Damase Bgin called to convene a caucus meeting to consider changing the leader with Onsime Gagnon and Hormisdas Langlais as possible contenders
Duplessis however managed to persuade his colleagues not to do that
The Union Nationale was at the brink of implosion but eventually survived the turbulent period following the electoral defeat
Another challenge to his leadership came in when Duplessis was criticised for his alcoholic tendencies—he would sometimes participate in parliamentary deliberations while completely drunk—but after being absent for a few months due to surgical treatment of strangulated hernia see relevant section the leader of opposition decided to quit drinking altogether
The Liberals introduced some progressive policies during their five years in power
One of the main achievements of the Godbout administration was granting women suffrage in provincial elections they were allowed to vote in federal elections since
Duplessis had previously considered the issue several times but largely avoided discussing it and generally either submitted abstentions or nays during floor votes and at one time proposed to block the legislation in committee
On this vote Duplessis as most of Union Nationale members opposed the government with the leader of the opposition in particular citing Godbout's voting record on women's suffrage he voted nay on seven previous occasions and criticizing the about-face
Duplessis did make some efforts to prevent passage of the bill but ultimately he did not seem to as intrigued by the issue as some other MLAs
Another landmark policy of the Liberals the introduction of compulsory schooling from age six to fourteen in was prompted by a report noting high dropout rates after four years of formal schooling
As with the women's suffrage the bill was opposed by Union Nationale and Duplessis only Camille Pouliot voted with the Liberals and during his fifteen years in power after Godbout the obligation was very rarely followed in Quebec
Finally in Godbout created Hydro-Qubec from the nationalization of Montreal Light Heat Power and its subsidiary Beauharnois Power but Duplessis again opposed the policy saying that its timing just before the election suggested that it was a political campaign trick
He also disagreed with the details of its implementation he argued that the takeover should have been made by Montreal rather than the provincial government the fact that the nationalization would cost taxpayer money and that the high electricity prices the main driver of the nationalization could be lowered via negotiations between the government and the companies rather than by assuming state ownership
Just as with the elections a third political force wanted to enter Quebec politics the anti-conscriptionist Bloc populaire a brainchild of such figures as Lionel Groulx and Georges Pelletier fr the editor-in chief of Le Devoir and centered around Andr Laurendeau and Maxime Raymond
It was mostly due to their efforts as part of the Ligue pour la Dfense du Canada the precursor to the Bloc populaire that over of Quebeckers voted against introducing conscription in in stark contrast with English-speaking Canada which overwhelmingly voted in favour
A nationalist formation it supported the nationalization of hydroelectricity and argued for more autonomy for Quebec at the same time it drew inspirations from Catholic social teaching corporatism and syndicalism
The party thus sought to compete for nationalist and anti-war votes with the Union Nationale but at the same time largely keeping the economic policies of the Liberals
Duplessis largely succeeded in sidelining the Bloc populaire however by portraying the religious minorities the federal government and the trade unions as threatening the province's interests autonomy traditions and identity
In the same vein Duplessis attacked Godbout's reforms as threatening the Church the clergy and the religion and indeed many Godbout's initiatives were criticized by Cardinal Villeneuve
During the campaign Duplessis notably floated a false anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that asserted that the federal government and the Quebec Liberals struck a secret deal with the so-called International Zionist Brotherhood to settle Holocaust refugees in Quebec in exchange for campaign contributions for federal and provincial Liberals and pledged to prevent it from happening
While Max Beer argues that this story did not influence the election result very much the public and the press was enthusiastic about a leader who would not let any refugees arrive in la belle province
The business community in its turn was assured by his will to pursue development driven by private investments and opposition to state takeovers of companies
In the election Duplessis's Union Nationale received the smallest share of votes in any election during his leadership just over and finished behind the Liberals in the popular vote count but due to vote splitting between the Bloc populaire and Godbout's party it was the Union Nationale that got the majority in the Legislative Assembly with out of MLAs belonging to Duplessis's party
This election marked the beginning of Duplessis's years as Premier of Quebec
Duplessis returned as premier in the election and held power without serious opposition for the next fifteen years until his death winning elections in and
He became known simply as le Chef the boss
He was elected to five terms of office in all the last four of them consecutive
Duplessis remains the last Quebec premier to have won three or more consecutive majority governments
After him no political party in Quebec elections at the provincial level had won more than two terms of office in a row until the December victory of Jean Charest's Liberal party its third consecutive win
Duplessis favoured rural areas over city development and introduced various agricultural credits during his first term
He was also noted for meagre investment in social services except education budget was multiplied by six between and in Catholic schools
Duplessis also opposed military conscription and Canadian involvement in World War II
The Union Nationale often had the active support of the Roman Catholic Church in its political campaigns
In Duplessis also attempted to introduce a law modeled on the American Taft-Hartley Act to eliminate certain labour union rights established by the Labour Relations Law of which was Quebec's equivalent of the American Wagner Act of
Duplessis's bill was withdrawn after fierce union opposition
Duplessis later introduced a similar law in known as Bill to force union groups to expel any communist-supporter
Any group would lose its trade union accreditation if there was a single member with ties to communist organizations or who supported the ideology
The bill was so unpopular that it lost even the support of the conservative Catholic union group
That controversy forced the union to review its structure which eventually led to the creation of the Confdration des syndicats nationaux CSN
Duplessis's time in office was marked by significant labour strikes such as the Dominion Textile in Valleyfield in the Asbestos Strike in Estrie and the Murdochville copper mine strike in
In those conflicts Duplessis responded rapidly with force by using the provincial police to disperse picket lines and restore order with several arrests
However the Murdochville strike led to a major victory for union rights and provided the impetus and inspiration for other labour leaders to emerge and energized calls for labour rights
Duplessis actively opposed Jehovah's Witnesses causing The Globe and Mail to comment The persecution of the religious sect known as Jehovah’s Witnesses now going on in Quebec Province with enthusiastic official and judicial sanction has taken a turn which suggests that the Inquisition has returned to French Canada In the Witnesses of the Canadian province of Quebec were continuously arrested up to twice the same day
Duplessis once used his influence to revoke a liquor licence from one of their members' businesses
Duplessis the decision of the lower court was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada and damages to Roncarelli were increased
Duplessis was ordered to pay in damages
In his comments Justice Abbott wrote The cancellation of the licence was made solely because of the plaintiff's association with the Witnesses of Jehovah and with the object and purpose of preventing him from continuing to furnish bail for members of that sect In a decision Duplessis influencing the liquor commission to cancel the license was deemed an improper use of his power
Duplessis died in office after a series of strokes he suffered while visiting the Iron Ore Company of Canada in Schefferville in the presence of seven government and company officials on September
Following his death and the subsequent election of a Liberal government under Jean Lesage in Quebec entered a period later termed the Quiet Revolution a decisive movement away from the conservative policies of Duplessis and toward a secular social democracy
Duplessis has not been without his defenders
Conrad Black's encomium Duplessis painted a sympathetic portrait of the man as a transitional figure towards modernism and the victim of partisan attack and personal malady
Nevertheless Duplessis's legacy has been the subject of repeated criticism in the decades since his death
Quebec nationalists dislike his anti-separatist stance liberals denounce his social conservatism
His critics hold that Duplessis's inherently corrupt patronage politics his reactionary conservatism his emphasis on traditional family and religious values his anachronistic anti-union stance rural focus and his preservation and promotion of Catholic Church institutions over the development of a secular social infrastructure akin to that underway in most of the postwar West stunted Quebec's social and economic development by at least a decade
In response it has been argued that the notion of the Duplessis black years is a myth propagated by all subsequent major political actors in Quebec due to a fundamental aversion to Catholic church-oriented traditionalist patterns of development with dominant intellectual movements combining various elements of this dislike
However the counter-argument that this is an over-simplification which fails to capture the complexities of Quebec politics society and its economy has consistently prevailed in public and academic discourse for some time
Aside from occasional defenders of his anti-communist and socially conservative views defence of the Duplessis government today comes primarily from traditionalist conservatives paleoconservatives in North American definition who view his regime as an essential reaffirmation of traditional values and as an assertion by democratic means of the basics of church and family life with low social spending and suppression of labour unions
Richard Jones an historian specialising in the political and cultural history of Canada and Quebec summed up Duplessis
The Duplessis regime may well have endured for too long the Union Nationale leader's traditionalist policies may well have been anachronistic when compared with the relatively modern society that in many respects the Quebec of the s had already becomeDuplessis was a lifelong bachelor and had no children
That is not to say however that Duplessis was not interested in women he met particularly in his student years
During World War I Duplessis courted Augustine Delisle a daughter of a prosperous coal trader
Duplessis's family disapproved of a connection that would unite them with a family of merchants
Duplessis remained bitter towards his family members over their opposition to this marriage and seems to have decided at this time never to marry
That said Duplessis remained close to his sisters as well as their husbands and children
He also became a godfather of a daughter of Antonio Talbot the minister of roads in his post-war government
Duplessis has had numerous health problems in his life
Duplessis underwent two surgeries for strangulated hernia in and which each time ended in several-month-long stays in the hospital due to complications or other diseases slowing down his reconvalescence as well as a shorter one for traumas he had during a car accident in
Maurice has also been a heavy drinker but on the advice of his doctor his party's pressure and Adlard Godbout's suggestion that this weakness was going to ruin Duplessis became abstinent after his second surgery
It was also in that it was discovered Duplessis had diabetes which particularly caused trouble particularly in his last years of life
Conrad Black also writes that he suffered from hypospadias
Despite a populist image Duplessis has created in public and rumours that persisted even after his death Duplessis's hobbies included opera and literature
Even though he most liked to read historical or political books he also read classical French or English-language authors such as Rudyard Kipling Tennyson and Shakespeare
Later in his life the Premier developed a taste for paintings and started collecting them
Balcer-Duplessis inherited the works of art which she donated to the provincial government in exchange for the cancellation of the inheritance tax
Most of the paintings including those by Clarence Gagnon Cornelius Krieghoff J
Turner Auguste Renoir Charles Jacque Cornelis Springer and Johan Jongkind may be seen in the National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec
On the other hand his love of sport was not unequivocal
In fact Duplessis has not practised any in his life except for croquet
However he supported the Montreal Canadiens and tuned into radio broadcasts of international baseball matches with the New York Yankees
In addition to that he ran a local cricket club in his hometown of Trois-Rivires
