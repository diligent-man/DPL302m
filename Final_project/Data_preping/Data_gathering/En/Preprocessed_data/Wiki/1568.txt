condition of average also called underinsurance in the u s or principle of average subject to average or pro rata condition of average in commonwealth countries is the insurance term used when calculating a payout against a claim where the policy undervalues the sum insured
in the event of partial loss the amount paid against a claim will be in the same proportion as the value of the underinsurance
the formula used is
payout
claim
sum insured
current value
displaystyle text payout text claim times frac text sum insured text current value
where payout is the amount paid out by the policy claim is the amount claimed against the policy after a loss sum insured is the maximum amount to be paid out by the policy and current value is the value the policy should be insured for
underinsurance occurs when sum insured is less than current value
sum insured is the maximum amount that can be paid out and is only paid out in cases of total destruction
where partial destruction occurs a more common occurrence than total destruction payout is pro rata in line with the underinsurance
this is due to insurance companies basing the premiums on their risk of losing the full sum insured against total destruction events
where a building s insurance policy is subject to average underinsurance can result in very high liabilities on the owner
for example if a flood or fire causes m of partial damage the building is insured for m but its true value is determined to be m the payout will be
payout
claim
sum insured
current value
displaystyle text payout text claim times frac text sum insured text current value mbox m times frac mbox m mbox m mbox m
this would leave the owner with an underinsurance shortfall of m
in the case where a building is listed and has a mandatory rebuild order it could be ruinous
under certain conditions if the sum insured is or more of the current value no deduction is made for partial losses
this is an example of a coinsurance with coinsurance requirement of
the contents of buildings are insured either separately from the buildings or frequently with dwelling houses as a separate part of a combined buildings contents insurance policy
whether separate or joint policies are used the insurance claim on either part cannot be transferred to the other for example under insurance of the contents cannot be offset by the claim made on the buildings insurance
when contents insurance states that new for old applies this increases the likelihood of under insurance
for example a quantity of items amongst the contents might have a low resale value but a high new for old value
this can happen if quantities of used or second hand goods are collected their resale value may be low but to replace as new would require a high payout against the policy
in such a case if the policy is subject to average any claim will be reduced by the value of the underinsurance
crucially this occurs with partial loss of the contents even where the low resale value contents are completely undamaged and may even be stored separately as in an undamaged outhouse covered as part of the policy
due to the potentially high shortfall burden some countries notably new zealand mandate that all policies subject to average have the policyholder acknowledge the risks of underinsurance the statute giving the following example to be incorporated into the policy
the meaning of subject to average
your insurance policy contains a provision making it subject to average
that provision will have effect only if the property insured under the policy is underinsured at the time of loss
if the property insured under the policy is underinsured at the time of loss the following rules apply
a if you suffer a total loss the provision will have no effect
b if you suffer a partial loss the maximum amount that you may recover will bear the same proportion to your actual loss as the amount for which the property is insured bears to the full value of the property
c whatever your loss in no case will you be entitled to recover more than the amount for which the property is insured
example your property is worth
you insure it for
you suffer a loss of
if your policy is subject to average the maximum amount that you may recover will be
to remove the risk of homeowners unwittingly falling into an underinsurance trap new zealand has legislation to ban the use of average clauses for dwelling houses
the history of average clauses began with cargo insurance
here if a proportion of a cargo had to be thrown overboard in storm to save the ship all cargo owners and the shipowner would jointly make good the loss to the owner of the cargo thrown overboard including the those that occurred the loss
the share each of the owners would pay would be based on their proportion of the total value of cargo or ship
this is commonly termed the law of general average
average clauses can cause problems with claims made during periods of volatility in commodities markets
for example if crude was being shipped from one part of the world to another and a partial loss occurred if its current value had risen the amount paid out by the insurance company may not cover the value of the contract
