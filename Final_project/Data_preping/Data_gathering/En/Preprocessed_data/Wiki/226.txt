2011–2014: 7th edition in 40 print volumes,with ongoing changes and additions to the online editionBarbara Elvers (Wiley-VCH) is currently Senior Editorial Advisor and Claudia Ley is Editor-in-Chief, both Wiley-VCH
The Editorial Board has around 20 members from different nations.
The encyclopedia is a multi-author work
Around 3,000 international authors from universities and industry contributed to it.
Note: The 'topics' are a selection of related articles provided by Wiley Online Library
The number (#) indicates that, for example, 15 articles relate to the main branch of agrochemicals
The numbers do not exactly sum up to the total number of articles (1,050), but its sole purpose is for organizing and categorizing the large number of articles where possible.
Agrochemicals (15 articles)
Analytical Techniques (30)
Biochemistry & Biotechnology (26)
Chemical Reactions (12)
Dyes and Pigments (29)
Energy (22)
Environmental Protection and Industrial Safety(29)
Fat, Oil, Food and Feed, Cosmetics (39)
Inorganic Chemicals (71)
Materials (33)
Metals and Alloys (38)
Organic Chemicals (114)

Renewable Resources (20)
Special Topics (64)In the 1940s, American Chemists Donald F
Othmer and Raymond E
Kirk from New York University began to create an English counterpart to Ullmann , named the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology
It was originally published by Wiley, which in 1996 took over the German Wiley-VCH publishing house and thus has combined the two encyclopedias ever since
The German chemistry magazine CHEManager wrote, quote: "In a double pack, the two companion works are simply unbeatable, because the knowledge gathered in both offers answers to (almost) all questions that can arise in connection with chemical products and processes."
These two encyclopedias were compared in Reference Reviews in 2007.
As of 2004, Kirk-Othmer was in its 5th edition with more than 1,300 articles in 27 volumes with over 22,950 pages.
