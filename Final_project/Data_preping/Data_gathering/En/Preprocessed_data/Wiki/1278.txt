longinus l n d a n s is the name given to the unnamed roman soldier who pierced the side of jesus with a lance and who in medieval and some modern christian traditions is described as a convert to christianity
his name first appeared in the apocryphal gospel of nicodemus
the lance is called in christianity the holy lance lancea and the story is related in the gospel of john during the crucifixion
this act is said to have created the last of the five holy wounds of christ
this person unnamed in the gospels is further identified in some versions of the legend as the centurion present at the crucifixion who said that jesus was the son of god so he is considered as one of the first christians and roman converts
longinus legend grew over the years to the point that he was said to have converted to christianity after the crucifixion and he is traditionally venerated as a saint in the roman catholic church eastern orthodox church and several other christian communions
no name for this soldier is given in the canonical gospels the name longinus is instead found in the acts of pilate a text appended to the apocryphal gospel of nicodemus
longinus did not start out as a saint
an early tradition found in a sixth or seventh century pseudepigraphal letter of herod to pilate claims that longinus suffered for having pierced jesus and that he was condemned to a cave where every night a lion came and mauled him until dawn after which his body healed back to normal in a pattern that would repeat until the end of time
later traditions turned him into a christian convert but as sabine baring gould observed the name of longinus was not known to the greeks previous to the patriarch germanus in
it was introduced amongst the westerns from the apocryphal gospel of nicodemus
there is no reliable authority for the acts and martyrdom of this saint
the name is probably latinized from the greek lonche the word used for the lance mentioned in john
it first appears lettered on an illumination of the crucifixion beside the figure of the soldier holding a spear written perhaps contemporaneously in horizontal greek letters loginos in the syriac gospel manuscript illuminated by a certain rabulas in the year in the laurentian library florence
the spear used is known as the holy lance and more recently especially in occult circles as the spear of destiny which was revered at jerusalem by the sixth century although neither the centurion nor the name longinus were invoked in any surviving report
as the lance of longinus the spear figures in the legends of the holy grail
blindness or other eye problems are not mentioned until after the tenth century
petrus comestor was one of the first to add an eyesight problem to the legend and his text can be translated as blind dim sighted or weak sighted
the golden legend says that he saw celestial signs before conversion and that his eye problems might have been caused by illness or age
the touch of jesus s blood cures his eye problem
christian legend has it that longinus was a blind roman centurion who thrust the spear into christ s side at the crucifixion
some of jesus s blood fell upon his eyes and he was healed
upon this miracle longinus believed in jesus
the body of longinus is said to have been lost twice and that its second recovery was at mantua in together with the holy sponge stained with christ s blood wherewith it was told extending longinus role that longinus had assisted in cleansing christ s body when it was taken down from the cross
the relic corpules of alleged blood taken from the holy lance enjoyed a revived cult in late th century bologna under the combined impetus of the grail romances the local tradition of eucharistic miracles the chapel consecrated to longinus the holy blood in the benedictine monastery church of sant andrea and the patronage of the bonacolsi
the relics are said to have been divided and then distributed to prague and elsewhere with the body taken to the basilica of sant agostino in rome
however official guides of the basilica do not mention the presence of any tomb associated with saint longinus
