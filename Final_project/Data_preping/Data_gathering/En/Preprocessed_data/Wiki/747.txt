The Fairchild C Flying Boxcar Navy and Marine Corps designation R Q was an American military transport aircraft developed from the World War II era Fairchild C Packet designed to carry cargo personnel litter patients and mechanized equipment and to drop cargo and troops by parachute The first C made its initial flight in November and by the time production ceased in more than C s had been built Its cargo hauling ability and unusual twin boom design earned it the nickname Flying Boxcar
The Air Force C and Navy R Q was initially a redesign of the earlier C Packet built between and The Packet provided service to the Air Force's Tactical Air Command and Military Air Transport Service for nearly nine years during which time its design was found to have several serious problems All of these were addressed in the C
In contrast to the C the cockpit was moved forward to fit flush with the nose rather than its previous location over the cargo compartment This resulted in more usable cargo space and larger loads than the C could accommodate The C also featured more powerful engines and a wider and stronger airframe The first C prototype called the XC B first flew in November with deliveries of C Bs from Fairchild's Hagerstown Maryland factory beginning in December
In Henry J Kaiser was awarded a contract to assemble additional C s at the Kaiser Frazer automotive factory located in the former B plant at Willow Run Airport in Belleville Michigan Initially the Kaiser built C F differed from the Fairchild aircraft by the use of Wright R Duplex Cyclone engines in place of Fairchild's use of the Pratt Whitney R Wasp Major radial engine Kaiser built C s at Willow Run in and AF Ser No to before converting the factory for a planned production of the Chase C that never eventuated The Kaiser sub contract was frowned upon by Fairchild and efforts were made through political channels to stop Kaiser's production which may have proven successful Following Kaiser's termination of C production the contract for the C was instead awarded to Fairchild Most Kaiser built aircraft were issued to the U S Marine Corps as R Qs with several later turned over to the South Vietnamese air force in the s a few others were later shipped to Belgium and Italy
The AC G Shadow gunship variant was fitted with four six barrel mm in NATO miniguns armor plating flare launchers and night capable infrared equipment Like the AC that preceded it the AC proved to be a potent weapon The AC was made more deadly by the introduction of the AC K Stinger version which featured the addition of two General Electric M Vulcan mm in cannon improved avionics and two underwing mounted General Electric J GE turbojet engines adding nearly lbf kN of thrust
Other major variants included the EC J used for satellite tracking and the YC H Skyvan prototype with larger wings and tail
In civilian use many C s feature the Jet Pack modification which incorporates a lbf N Westinghouse J turbojet engine in a nacelle above the fuselage
built by Kaiser Frazer CorpTwo additional airframes were built by Fairchild for static tests
The aircraft saw extensive action during the Korean War as a troop and equipment transport In July four C s were sent to FEAF for service tests Two months later the C deployed with the th Troop Carrier Group and served in Korea throughout the war
In December after People's Republic of China Expeditionary People's Volunteer Army troops blew up a bridge at a narrow point on the evacuation route between Koto ri and Hungnam blocking the withdrawal of U N forces eight U S Air Force C Flying Boxcars flown by the th Troop Carrier Group were used to drop portable bridge sections by parachute The bridge consisting of eight separate sixteen foot long pound sections was dropped one section at a time using two parachutes on each section Four of these sections together with additional wooden extensions were successfully reassembled into a replacement bridge by Marine Corps combat engineers and the US Army th Engineer Treadway Bridge Company enabling U N forces to reach Hungnam
From to C C F and G models served with U S Air Forces in Europe USAFE and Far East Air Forces FEAF as the first line Combat Cargo units and did yeoman work as freight haulers with the th Troop Carrier Wing the th Troop Carrier Wing and the th Troop Carrier Wing in Europe based first in Germany and then in France with roughly aircraft operating anywhere from Greenland to India A similar number of aircraft served in the Pacific and the Far East In the th absorbed the th and transitioned to the C s but the units of the former th Troop Carrier Wing the th th and th Troop Carrier Squadrons continued to fly C s until the last non Air Force Reserve and non Air National Guard operational units to fly the Boxcars
The USAF Strategic Air Command had C Flying Boxcars in service from to
Perhaps the most remarkable use of the C was the aerial recovery of balloons UAVs and even satellites The first use of this technique was in when C s were used to recover Ryan AQM Firebee unmanned targets The th Troop Carrier Wing which was attached to the Strategic Air Command SAC from April May used C s to retrieve instrument packages from high altitude reconnaissance balloons C s from the rd Test Squadron based at Hickam Air Force Base Hawaii performed several aerial recoveries of film return capsules during the early years of the Corona spy satellite program On August the recovery by a C of film from the Corona mission code named Discoverer was the first successful recovery of film from an orbiting satellite and the first aerial recovery of an object returning from Earth orbit
The C went on to see extensive service in French Indochina beginning in with aircraft secretly loaned by the CIA to French forces for troop support These aircraft were generally flown in French markings by American CIA pilots often accompanied by French officers and support staff The C was to play a major role during the siege at Dien Bien Phu where they flew into increasingly heavy fire while dropping supplies to the besieged French forces The only two American pilot casualties of the siege at Dien Bien Phu were James B McGovern Jr and Wallace A Buford Both pilots together with a French crew member were killed in early June when their C while making an artillery drop was hit and crippled by Viet Minh anti aircraft fire the aircraft then flew an additional miles km into Laos before it crashed
During the Sino Indian War of the C was extensively used to supply Indian forces President Kennedy allowed sales of spare C on a priority basis upon request by the Indian government
During the Vietnam War the incredible success of the Douglas AC Spooky continued but limitations of the size and carrying capacity of the plane led the USAF to develop a larger plane to carry more surveillance gear weaponry and ammunition the AC Spectre However due to the strong demands of C s for cargo use there were not enough Hercules frames to provide Spectres for operations against the enemy The USAF filled the gap by converting C s into AC s each equipped with four minigun pods a Xenon searchlight night observation sight flare launcher fire control computer and TRW fire control safety display to prevent incidents of friendly fire The new AC squadron was given the call sign Creep that launched a wave of indignation that led the Air Force to change the name to Shadow on December C Gs were modified as AC G Shadows and AC K Stingers They were used successfully in both close air support missions in South Vietnam and interdiction missions against trucks and supplies along the Ho Chi Minh Trail All the AC G Gunships were transferred to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force starting in as the American forces began to be withdrawn
During the late s and early s Air National Guard and USAF Reserve pilots flew C 's to drop parachutist students for the US Army Parachute School at Ft Benning Georgia
After retirement from active duty substantial numbers of C s and R Qs soldiered on in the U S Navy U S Marine Corps the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard until the mid s the R Qs also being redesignated as C s in The last military use of the C by the United States ended in when a single squadron of Navy Reserve C s based at Naval Air Facility Detroit Selfridge Air National Guard Base near Detroit Michigan and two squadrons based at Naval Air Station Los Alamitos California replaced their C s with newer aircraft
Many C s were provided to other nations as part of the Military Assistance Program including Belgium Brazil Ethiopia India Italy Jordan Taiwan and as previously mentioned South Vietnam The type was also used by the Royal Canadian Air Force and by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps under the designation R Q until when they were also redesignated as C
A number of aircraft were acquired by companies who were contracted by federal agencies including the United States Forest Service USFS and the Bureau of Land Management BLM to provide airtankers for fighting wildfires Others were pressed into civilian cargo service After a series of crashes the age and safety of the aircraft being used as airtankers became a serious concern and the U S C airtanker fleet was permanently grounded in Eventually many of these aircraft were provided to museums across the U S in a complicated and ultimately illegal scheme where stored USAF Lockheed C Hercules transports and Navy Lockheed P Orion anti submarine patrol aircraft were provided to the contractors in exchange for the C s See U S Forest Service airtanker scandal After the end of the airtanker days many C s flew in Alaska for Northern Pacific Transport Gifford Aviation Stebbins Ambler Air transport and Delta Associates being used for public service contracts such as hauling building materials to the villages in the bush of Alaska that have no road access
Several aircraft were observed as late as by paratroopers with the th Infantry Division to be in Forest Service use as jump planes for smokejumper firefighters in Alaska These aircraft were boarded and toured by the Army paratroopers at Ft Wainwright Alaska
