The House of Moray or Clann Ruaidrí is a historiographical and genealogical construct to illustrate the succession of rulers whose base was in Moray and who ruled sometimes a larger kingdom It is much the same as Cenél Loairn although not necessarily exactly an originally Gaelic concept to express one of the two rivalling leader clans of early medieval Scotland
The so called house of Loairn or of Moray was distantly related to the Scottish House of Alpin its rival and claiming descent from the eponymous founder Loarn mac Eirc Some of its members became the last kings of the Picts while three centuries later two members succeeded to the Scottish throne ruling Scotland from until
At the times when the rival house held the throne the Loairn leaders usually had their effectively independent state of Moray where a succession of kings kinglets or mormaers ruled
The Loairn succession followed quite loyally the rules of tanistry resulting in practice to outcomes where branches of the leaders' extended family rotated on the rulership possibly keeping a balance between important branches This is quite typical for tribal societies where primogeniture is much less usual than agnatic seniority or turns on the throne For example Macbeth King of Scotland descended from one branch and his stepson Lulach from another
Not much nor convincing evidence survives that the House of Loairn followed in any way the postulated Pictish tradition of matrilineal succession Rather their succession seems to follow quite fully the Irish Celtic tradition of agnatic clan
Following kings of Dál Riata are recorded to have been members of the Cenél Loairn
Muiredach mac AinbcellaigCenél Loairn kings in particular the descendants of Ferchar Fota competed successfully for control of Dál Riata in the early th century prior to the Pictish conquest of the kingdom by Óengus mac Fergusa
Following the death of Donnchad mac Crínáin in two members of the kindred ruled as Kings of Scots
Lulach mac Gillai Comgain ri AlbanAdditionally Giric mac Dúngail may have been a member of this kindred
Already MacBeth's father and cousin Lulach's uncle had been kings of Alba
Mael Coluim mac Mael Brighdi mac Ruaidrí rí Alban Lulach's son and grandson were however titled kings of Moray not of Alba
Oengus mac inghine Lulaich ri Moréb killed Óengus of Moray died who has no attestation of descending in male line from Cenel Loairn clan he was son of daughter of Lulach is the last known member of the kindred to have ruled Moray after which it supposedly passed to William fitz Duncan of the Cenél nGabráin descended royal family While the Meic Uilleim and MacHeths are sometimes associated with Moray it is no longer widely supposed that they were claiming the Mormaerdom or that they belonged to this kindred except possibly through female descent
