the bykivnia graves ukrainian is a national historic memorial next to the former village of bykivnia ukrainian russian polish bykownia within kyiv woodland bykivnia forest
during the stalinist period in the soviet union it was one of the unmarked mass grave sites where the nkvd the soviet secret police disposed of thousands of executed enemies of the soviet state
bykivnia as a residential place still exists as an oscillated locality with the same bykivnia forest
the national memorial is located across brovarskyi prospect from bykivnia next to the former fishery soviet farm rybne in the thick of the woods
the number of dead bodies buried there is estimated between dozens of thousand to to though some estimates place the number as high as
from the early s until late s throughout the stalinist purges the soviet government hauled the bodies of tortured and killed political prisoners to the pine forests outside the village of bykivnia and buried them in a grave that spanned square metres sq ft
so far separate mass graves have been identified by polish and ukrainian archaeologists working at the site
during the soviet retreat in the early stages of the operation barbarossa the red army troops levelled the village to the ground
the mass grave site was discovered by the germans along with many other such sites throughout the soviet union
however following the discovery of the katyn massacre the burial sites of bykivnya was no longer part of german propaganda
after the soviet recapture of the area in the course of the second battle of kiev in the site was yet again classified by the nkvd
in the s the village was reconstructed as a suburb of kyiv
in the s the soviet authorities planned to construct a large bus station on the mass grave site but the plan was abandoned
a document attesting to the origins of the bykovnia victims was found by the polish migr historians in nazi german archives after the war
polish researchers estimate that apart from the soviet victims of the great terror the site might be the final resting place of polish officers captured by the red army during the soviet invasion of poland together with nazi germany in most of whom were executed in the spring of with over polish officers and intellectuals in the katyn massacre
however as the soviet authorities denied responsibility there was no way to confirm that the victims of the stalinist purges were indeed buried there
during the soviet era the existence of the site was brought up to authorities numerous times with the most famous incident occurring in when the ukrainian poet vasyl symonenko did so
he was badly beaten up by soviet law enforcement agents and died in the hospital from kidney failure soon after
it was not until the s that the authorities of independent ukraine confirmed the burial of thousands of victims there
on april a large memorial to the victims of communism was opened in bykivnia
around the same time archaeological works started with both ukrainian and polish scientists taking part
in the government of viktor yanukovych proclaimed the will to convert the bykivnia woods into a state historical memorial complex graves of bykivnia
the plan was brought to life by viktor yushchenko on may
in a step toward uncovering this part of ukraine s history viktor yushchenko became the first ukrainian president to take part in the annual day of remembrance ceremony on may to honor the estimated people buried in the mass grave on the outskirts of kyiv
we must know the truth
why did our nation lose more than million people without a war yushchenko said during the event
since polish researchers have found a number of bodies of poles prisoners killed in spring during the katyn massacre
apart from bodies polish researchers found everyday use things such as a comb on which the owner an unknown polish officer carved several names such as franciszek strzelecki ludwik dworak and szczyrad
this might be referring to colonel bronis aw miko aj szczyrad owski deputy commandant of lw w s defense in september
also a dog tag belonging to sergeant j zef naglik soldier of the skalat battalion of the border defence corps was found at the same spot
all the names belong to the ukrainian katyn list of katyn massacre victims and serve as proof that bykivnya is connected to the katyn crime
