Makara/Makar Sankranti or Uttarayan or Maghi or simply Sankranti, also known in West Bengal as Mokor Sonkranti, in Mithila as Til Sakraait and in Nepal as Maghe Sankranti, 'Sankranti' here means ‘transfer’, this day is considered as the transition day of Sun into Capricorn
Now the sun moves northwards in the Hindu calendar, dedicated to the deity Surya (sun), many native multi-day festivals are organised all over India
It is observed each year the day Sun enters the Capricorn zodiac which corresponds with the month of January as per the Gregorian calendar
It marks the first day of the sun's transit into Makara rashi (Capricorn).
Due to the addition of one day in leap years, the date of Makar Sankranti may vary a bit
On leap years it falls on 15 January, otherwise on 14 January.
The festivities associated with Makar Sankranti are known by various names Magh Bihu in Assam, Maghi in Punjab, Maghi Saaji in Himachal Pradesh, Maghi Sangrand or Uttarain (Uttarayana) in Jammu, Sakrat in Haryana, Sakraat in Rajasthan, Sukarat in central India, Pongal in Tamil Nadu, Uttarayan in Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh, Ghughuti in Uttarakhand, Dahi Chura in Bihar, Makar Sankranti in Odisha, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, West Bengal (also called Poush Sankranti), Uttar Pradesh (also called Khichidi Sankranti), Uttarakhand (also called Uttarayani) or as simply, Sankranti in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Maghe Sankranti (Nepal), Songkran (Thailand), Thingyan (Myanmar), Mohan Songkran (Cambodia), and Shishur Senkrath (Kashmir)
On Makar Sankranti, the Sun god is worshipped along with Lord Vishnu and goddess Lakshmi throughout India.
Makar Sankranti is observed with social festivities such as colourful decorations, rural children going house to house, singing and asking for treats in some areas, melas (fairs), dances, kite flying, bonfires and feasts
The Magha Mela, according to Indologist Diana L
Eck, is mentioned in the Hindu epic Mahabharata
Many observers go to sacred rivers or lakes and bathe in a ceremony of thanks to the sun
Every twelve years, the Hindus observe Makar Sankranti with Kumbha Mela – one of the world's largest mass pilgrimage, with an estimated 60 to 100 million people attending the event
At this event, they say a prayer to the sun and bathe at the Prayagaraj confluence of the River Ganga and River Yamuna, a tradition attributed to Adi Shankaracharya.
Makar Sankranti is set by the solar cycle and corresponds to the exact time astronomical event of the Sun entering Capricorn and is observed on a day that usually falls on 14 January of the Gregorian calendar, but on 15 January in leap years
Makar Sankranti's date and time is analogous to Sidereal time of Zodiac sign of Capricorn (when sun enters).
The year is 365.24 days long and the time difference between the two consecutive instances of Makar Sankranti (Sidereal time of the Zodiac sign of Capricorn) is almost the same as the year
We only have 365 days in a year so in the time of four years Calendar lags by one day so we need to adjust it by leap day, 29 February
But Makar Sankranti falls before leap day correction is made therefore on every fourth year it falls on 15 January
Sidereal time of sign of Capricorn also shifts by a day due to leap year
Similarly, the time of Equinoxes also shifts by a day in each four years window
For example, Equinox of September does not fall on the same date each year nor does the winter solstice
Any event related to one revolution of the earth around the sun will have this date shift within 4 years cycle
Similar changes can be seen in the exact time of Solstices and equinoxes
See the table, how the time of the equinox and a Solstice increases and decreases in a cycle of four years.
We can see the time difference between two consecutive winter Solstices is about 5 hours 49 minutes 59 seconds, with respect to winter Solistice time, and the time difference between two consecutive Mankar Sankranti is about 6 hours and 10 minutes
Towards the end of the 21st Century, there will be more occurrences of Makar Sankranti on 15 January in a four-year cycle.
And Makar Sankranti (the Sidereal time of the Zodiac sign of Capricorn) will be on 16 January for the first in the year 2102 as 2100 will not be a leap year.
Makar Sankranti is celebrated when the Sun's ecliptic longitude becomes 270° measured from a fixed starting point which is in opposition to Spica, i.e
this is a sidereal measure
Uttarayan begins when the Sun's ecliptic longitude becomes 270° measured from the Vernal equinox, i.e
this is a tropical measure
While both concern a measure of 270° their starting points are different
Hence, Makar Sankarant and Uttarayan occur on different days
On the Gregorian calendar, Makar Sankaranthi occurs on 14th / 15 Jan; Uttarayan starts on Dec 21st.
Most Hindu almanacs ignore this difference and represent Makara Sankaranti as the start of Uttarayan too
Due to the precession of the equinoxes the tropical zodiac (i.e
all the equinoxes and solstices) shifts by about 1° in 72 years
As a result, the December solstice (Uttarayana) is continuously but very slowly moving away from Makar Sankranti
Conversely, the December solstice (Uttarayana) and Makar Sankranti must have coincided at some time in the distant past
Such a coincidence last happened 1700 years back, in 291 AD .
Every year Makar Sankranti is celebrated in the month of January
This festival is dedicated to the Hindu religious sun god Surya
This significance of Surya is traceable to the Vedic texts, particularly the Gayatri Mantra, a sacred hymn of Hinduism found in its scripture named the Rigveda
According to the constitution of God, Our Holy Vedas and Shrimad Bhagwat Geeta, if we take initiation from a Complete Guru/Saint and worship Supreme God and attain emancipation
By performing true scripture-based way of worship, one’s life becomes blessed, and the Earth will become heaven.
Makara Sankranti is regarded as important for spiritual practices and accordingly, people take a holy dip in rivers, especially Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri
The bathing is believed to result in merit or absolution of past sins
They also pray to the sun and thank for their successes and prosperity
A shared cultural practices found amongst Hindus of various parts of India is making sticky, bound sweets particularly from sesame (til) and a sugar base such as jaggery (gud, gur, gul)
This type of sweet is a symbolism for being together in peace and joyfulness, despite the uniqueness and differences between individuals
For most parts of India, this period is a part of early stages of the Rabi crop and agricultural cycle, where crops have been sown and the hard work in the fields is mostly over
The time thus signifies a period of socializing and families enjoying each other's company, taking care of the cattle, and celebrating around bonfires, in Gujarat the festival is celebrated by flying kites.

The Tripuri is the promoter of Hangrai festivals
They have first introduced this festival of immersing of ancestors' remains in the holy river
Since then it was adopted by other groups in India and popularized over the years.
Mythology inform us that when the world was just created by Lord Siva or Sibrai there was only the grassland and nothing was present
The god then created an egg to produce a human being
The egg hatched to give birth to a human being, creating a big bang
He crawled out of eggshells and looked around for anyone like him, but he found none
There was total silence, peace tranquility, and harmony on the earth
He was frightened by seeing this scenario of earth
He remained near the eggshell most of the time and went back near to the empty eggshell, went inside of half of the shell and covered it with another one, and hid there.
The almighty God was upset by this development
Years later he created another egg, and after ten months it hatched
There was a big bang when it hatched that shook the earth and gave birth to another human
He was very courageous and powerful, as soon as he came out of the human eggshell, he started shouting and announced to the whole of the world, 'I am the first to be born in this earth, I am the eldest on the earth, no one is elder to me in this earth
He named himself Subrai and declared to the whole of the earth that he is the ruler of this earth and king of this universe
Hearing the big bang Hangrai got more frightened, closed his eyes, and silently remained inside the shell
But when he heard the voice like his own, he came out of his shell and met Subrai
At this Subrai told that he is older than Hangrai, since then Subrai became the elder brother of Hangrai, and people knew them as it is.
Thousand of years later when they grew older, the time had come to leave this world
As Hangrai grew older than Subrai, one day he felt sick very seriously, Hangrai was on his death bed, Subrai was taking care of him
Then god came before them and said, 'Among both of you, Hangrai is elder than Subrai, I only know this, because I have created both of you
Hangrai will leave this earth very soon
Subrai will do all necessary rituals to cremate the body of Hangrai.' And god disappeared from there.
Then Subrai cried like a baby, touching the feet of Hangrai, saying, 'Elder brother, I have treated you like a younger brother for thousands of years, forgive me for my wrongdoing unto you.'
Hangrai said, 'I have done so!' and touched his head as gesture of forgiving and blessing unto him, and then breadth for his last.
After the death of Hangrai, his younger brother Subrai cremated his body and did all the rituals, and immerged Hangrai's remaining in the holy water of the river on the last day of Pousa month
Since then, people observed these rituals and festivals every year and continued to this day
That is why the day is named "Hangrai", which has later adopted by other ethnic groups of people of India.
Every year on the day of Hangrai the Tripuri people observe it in grand pomp and show
In every house of Tripuri preparation for Hangrai starts two-three days before
Houses are cleaned, washed whitewashed
