makara makar sankranti or uttarayan or maghi or simply sankranti also known in west bengal as mokor sonkranti in mithila as til sakraait and in nepal as maghe sankranti sankranti here means transfer this day is considered as the transition day of sun into capricorn
now the sun moves northwards in the hindu calendar dedicated to the deity surya sun many native multi day festivals are organised all over india
it is observed each year the day sun enters the capricorn zodiac which corresponds with the month of january as per the gregorian calendar
it marks the first day of the sun s transit into makara rashi capricorn
due to the addition of one day in leap years the date of makar sankranti may vary a bit
on leap years it falls on january otherwise on january
the festivities associated with makar sankranti are known by various names magh bihu in assam maghi in punjab maghi saaji in himachal pradesh maghi sangrand or uttarain uttarayana in jammu sakrat in haryana sakraat in rajasthan sukarat in central india pongal in tamil nadu uttarayan in gujarat and uttar pradesh ghughuti in uttarakhand dahi chura in bihar makar sankranti in odisha karnataka maharashtra goa west bengal also called poush sankranti uttar pradesh also called khichidi sankranti uttarakhand also called uttarayani or as simply sankranti in andhra pradesh and telangana maghe sankranti nepal songkran thailand thingyan myanmar mohan songkran cambodia and shishur senkrath kashmir
on makar sankranti the sun god is worshipped along with lord vishnu and goddess lakshmi throughout india
makar sankranti is observed with social festivities such as colourful decorations rural children going house to house singing and asking for treats in some areas melas fairs dances kite flying bonfires and feasts
the magha mela according to indologist diana l
eck is mentioned in the hindu epic mahabharata
many observers go to sacred rivers or lakes and bathe in a ceremony of thanks to the sun
every twelve years the hindus observe makar sankranti with kumbha mela one of the world s largest mass pilgrimage with an estimated to million people attending the event
at this event they say a prayer to the sun and bathe at the prayagaraj confluence of the river ganga and river yamuna a tradition attributed to adi shankaracharya
makar sankranti is set by the solar cycle and corresponds to the exact time astronomical event of the sun entering capricorn and is observed on a day that usually falls on january of the gregorian calendar but on january in leap years
makar sankranti s date and time is analogous to sidereal time of zodiac sign of capricorn when sun enters
the year is days long and the time difference between the two consecutive instances of makar sankranti sidereal time of the zodiac sign of capricorn is almost the same as the year
we only have days in a year so in the time of four years calendar lags by one day so we need to adjust it by leap day february
but makar sankranti falls before leap day correction is made therefore on every fourth year it falls on january
sidereal time of sign of capricorn also shifts by a day due to leap year
similarly the time of equinoxes also shifts by a day in each four years window
for example equinox of september does not fall on the same date each year nor does the winter solstice
any event related to one revolution of the earth around the sun will have this date shift within years cycle
similar changes can be seen in the exact time of solstices and equinoxes
see the table how the time of the equinox and a solstice increases and decreases in a cycle of four years
we can see the time difference between two consecutive winter solstices is about hours minutes seconds with respect to winter solistice time and the time difference between two consecutive mankar sankranti is about hours and minutes
towards the end of the st century there will be more occurrences of makar sankranti on january in a four year cycle
and makar sankranti the sidereal time of the zodiac sign of capricorn will be on january for the first in the year as will not be a leap year
makar sankranti is celebrated when the sun s ecliptic longitude becomes measured from a fixed starting point which is in opposition to spica i e
this is a sidereal measure
uttarayan begins when the sun s ecliptic longitude becomes measured from the vernal equinox i e
this is a tropical measure
while both concern a measure of their starting points are different
hence makar sankarant and uttarayan occur on different days
on the gregorian calendar makar sankaranthi occurs on th jan uttarayan starts on dec st
most hindu almanacs ignore this difference and represent makara sankaranti as the start of uttarayan too
due to the precession of the equinoxes the tropical zodiac i e
all the equinoxes and solstices shifts by about in years
as a result the december solstice uttarayana is continuously but very slowly moving away from makar sankranti
conversely the december solstice uttarayana and makar sankranti must have coincided at some time in the distant past
such a coincidence last happened years back in ad
every year makar sankranti is celebrated in the month of january
this festival is dedicated to the hindu religious sun god surya
this significance of surya is traceable to the vedic texts particularly the gayatri mantra a sacred hymn of hinduism found in its scripture named the rigveda
according to the constitution of god our holy vedas and shrimad bhagwat geeta if we take initiation from a complete guru saint and worship supreme god and attain emancipation
by performing true scripture based way of worship one s life becomes blessed and the earth will become heaven
makara sankranti is regarded as important for spiritual practices and accordingly people take a holy dip in rivers especially ganga yamuna godavari krishna and kaveri
the bathing is believed to result in merit or absolution of past sins
they also pray to the sun and thank for their successes and prosperity
a shared cultural practices found amongst hindus of various parts of india is making sticky bound sweets particularly from sesame til and a sugar base such as jaggery gud gur gul
this type of sweet is a symbolism for being together in peace and joyfulness despite the uniqueness and differences between individuals
for most parts of india this period is a part of early stages of the rabi crop and agricultural cycle where crops have been sown and the hard work in the fields is mostly over
the time thus signifies a period of socializing and families enjoying each other s company taking care of the cattle and celebrating around bonfires in gujarat the festival is celebrated by flying kites

at this subrai told that he is older than hangrai since then subrai became the elder brother of hangrai and people knew them as it is
thousand of years later when they grew older the time had come to leave this world
as hangrai grew older than subrai one day he felt sick very seriously hangrai was on his death bed subrai was taking care of him
then god came before them and said among both of you hangrai is elder than subrai i only know this because i have created both of you
hangrai will leave this earth very soon
subrai will do all necessary rituals to cremate the body of hangrai and god disappeared from there
