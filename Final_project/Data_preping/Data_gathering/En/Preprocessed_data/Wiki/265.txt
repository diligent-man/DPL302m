crashplan backs up data to remote servers or hard drives
it is available on mac windows and linux
as of backup to other computers is no longer supported
initial backups may take several hours via lan or days over the internet depending on the amount of data and bandwidth available but afterwards continuous and incremental backups are conducted without user intervention
around there used to be a paid option for seed loading in which a hard drive was sent to the user so a faster local backup could be performed to the drive and it could be shipped back to code for initial backup
however this seeded backup service was no longer offered in neither was the corresponding restore to door service which would allow a hard drive containing extensive restore data from backups to be shipped back to the user faster than an over the internet download
with crashplan data is encrypted password protected and stored in a proprietary format
there is also an option for a more secure private key
corporate users in that had crashplan proe back up to private servers instead of code s data centers in four out of five cases
in the software had an option to create a private on site backup server
