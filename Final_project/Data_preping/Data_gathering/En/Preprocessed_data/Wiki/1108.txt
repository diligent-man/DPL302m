charles benedict davenport june february was a biologist and eugenicist influential in the american eugenics movement
davenport was born in stamford connecticut to amzi benedict davenport an abolitionist of puritan ancestry and his wife jane joralemon dimon of english dutch and italian ancestry
his father had eleven children by two wives and charles grew up with his family on garden place in brooklyn heights
his mother s strong beliefs tended to rub off onto charles and he followed the example of his mother
during the summer months charles and his family spent their time on a family farm near stamford
due to davenport s father s strong belief in protestantism as a young boy charles was tutored at home
this came about in order for charles to learn the values of hard work and education
when he was not studying charles worked as a janitor and errand boy for his father s business
his father had a significant influence on his early career as he encouraged charles to become an engineer
however this was not his primary interest and after working for a few years to save up money charles enrolled in harvard college to pursue his genuine interest of becoming a scientist
he graduated with a bachelor s after two years and earned a ph d in biology in
he married gertrude crotty a zoology graduate of harvard in
he had two daughters with gertrude millia crotty and jane davenport harris di tomasi
later on davenport became a professor of zoology at harvard
he became one of the most prominent american biologists of his time pioneering new quantitative standards of taxonomy
davenport had a tremendous respect for the biometric approach to evolution pioneered by francis galton and karl pearson and was involved in pearson s journal biometrika
however after the re discovery of gregor mendel s laws of heredity he moved on to become a prominent supporter of mendelian inheritance
from to davenport worked in chicago
he was curator of the zoological museum of the university of chicago from to
in davenport became director of cold spring harbor laboratory where he founded the eugenics record office in
during his time at cold spring harbor laboratory davenport began a series of investigations into aspects of the inheritance of human personality and mental traits and over the years he generated hundreds of papers and several books on the genetics of alcoholism pellagra later shown to be due to a vitamin deficiency criminality feeblemindedness seafaringness bad temper intelligence manic depression and the biological effects of race crossing
additionally davenport mentored many people while working at the laboratory such as massachusetts suffragist claiborne catlin elliman
before charles davenport came across eugenics he studied math
he came to know these subjects through professors karl pearson and gentleman amateur francis galton
he met them in london
upon meeting them he fell in love with the subject matter
in biometrika a journal of which charles davenport was a co editor gave him the opportunity to use the skills that he had learned
davenport became an advocate of the biometrical approach for the rest of his life
he began to study human heredity and much of his effort was later turned to promoting eugenics
his book heredity in relation to eugenics was used as a college textbook for many years
the year after it was published davenport was elected to the national academy of sciences
davenport s work with eugenics caused much controversy among many other eugenicists and scientists
although his writings were about eugenics their findings were very simplistic and out of touch with the findings from genetics
this caused much racial and class bias
only his most ardent admirers regarded it as truly scientific work
during davenport s tenure at cold spring harbor several reorganizations took place there
in the carnegie institution of washington took over funding of the ero with an additional handsome endowment from mary harriman
davenport was elected to the american philosophical society in
in he was elected as a fellow of the american statistical association
davenport founded the international federation of eugenics organizations ifeo in with eugen fischer as chairman of the commission on bastardization and miscegenation
davenport aspired to found a world institute for miscegenations and was working on a world map of the mixed race areas which he introduced for the first time at a meeting of the ifeo in munich in
together with his assistant morris steggerda davenport attempted to develop a comprehensive quantitative approach to human miscegenation
the results of their research was presented in the book race crossing in jamaica which attempted to provide statistical evidence for biological and cultural degradation following interbreeding between white and black populations
today it is considered a work of scientific racism and was criticized in its time for drawing conclusions which stretched far beyond and sometimes counter to the data it presented
particularly caustic was the review of the book published by karl pearson at nature where he considered that the only thing that is apparent in the whole of this lengthy treatise is that the samples are too small and drawn from too heterogeneous a population to provide any trustworthy conclusions at all
the entire eugenics movement was criticized for being supposedly based on racist and classist assumptions set out to prove the unfitness of wide sections of the american population which davenport and his followers considered degenerate using methods criticized even by british eugenicists as unscientific
in and charles davenport and his wife wrote four essays that pertained to human hereditary genes
these essays included hair color eye color and skin pigmentation
these essays helped pave the way for eugenics to be taught in class
many of the topics and discussions belonged to dr
and mrs
charles davenport but the information for one essay in particular came from friends of theirs involved in the same topic
many problems occurred when they started to use other information
as davenport and other eugenicist professors and experts began to and continued to study more in depth eugenics they had to start to come up with original ideas so as not to conflict with past ideas
another way charles davenport s work manifested in the public sphere is regarding the topic of immigration
he believed that race determined behavior and that many mental and behavioral traits were hereditary
he drew these conclusions by studying family pedigrees and was criticized by some of his peers for making unfounded conclusions
regardless davenport believed that the biological differences between the races justified a strict immigration policy and that people of races deemed undesirable should not be allowed into the country
his support of mendelian genetics fueled this belief as he believed allowing certain groups of people to enter the country would negatively impact the nation s genetic pool
domestically he also supported the prevention of negative eugenics through sterilization and sexual segregation of people who were considered genetically inferior
sharing the racist views of many scientists during this time those that davenport considered to be genetically inferior included black people and southeastern europeans
in addition to supporting these beliefs through his scientific work he was actively involved in lobbying members of congress
charles davenport spoke regularly with congressman albert johnson who was a cosponsor of the immigration bill and encouraged him to restrict immigration in that legislation
davenport was not alone in this effort to influence policy as harry laughlin the superintendent of the eugenics record office appeared before congress on multiple occasions to promote strict immigration laws and the belief that immigration was a biological problem
in all davenport s efforts served to provide scientific justification to social policies he supported and immigration was one way this manifested in the beginning of the th century
after adolf hitler s rise to power in germany davenport maintained connections with various nazi institutions and publications both before and during world war ii
he held editorial positions at two influential german journals both of which were founded in and in he wrote a contribution to the festschrift for otto reche who became an important figure in the plan to remove those populations considered inferior in eastern germany
in a letter to the editor of life magazine he included both franklin roosevelt and joseph goebbels as examples of crippled statesmen who motivated by their physical defects have led revolutions and aspired to dictatorships while burdening their country with heavy taxes and reducing its finances to chaos
although many other scientists had stopped supporting eugenics due to the rise of nazism in germany charles davenport remained a fervent supporter until the end of his life
six years after he retired in davenport held firm to these beliefs even after the carnegie institute pulled funding from the eugenics program at cold spring harbor in
while charles davenport is remembered primarily for his role in the eugenics movement he also had a significant influence in increasing funding for genetics research
his success in organizing the financial support for scientific endeavors fueled his success throughout his career while also allowing for the study of other scientists
indeed cold spring harbor saw many prominent geneticists go through its doors while he was its director
he died of pneumonia in at the age of
he is buried in laurel hollow new york
as quoted in the national academy of sciences biographical memoir of charles benedict davenport by oscar riddle davenport s eugenics creed was as follows
i believe in striving to raise the human race to the highest plane of social organization of cooperative work and of effective endeavor
i believe that i am the trustee of the germ plasm that i carry that this has been passed on to me through thousands of generations before me and that i betray the trust if that germ plasm being good i so act as to jeopardize it with its excellent possibilities or from motives of personal convenience to unduly limit offspring
i believe that having made our choice in marriage carefully we the married pair should seek to have to children in order that our carefully selected germ plasm shall be reproduced in adequate degree and that this preferred stock shall not be swamped by that less carefully selected
i believe in such a selection of immigrants as shall not tend to adulterate our national germ plasm with socially unfit traits
i believe in repressing my instincts when to follow them would injure the next generation spiro jonathan p
