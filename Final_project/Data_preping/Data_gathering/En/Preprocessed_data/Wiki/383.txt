nypd officer james darrell edwards iii catches an unnaturally agile fleeing criminal and sees his eyes blink in an unusual manner before he leaps from the roof of the guggenheim museum
during his interrogation k arrives and scouts james as a potential new partner impressed by his ability to chase down an alien
k explains to james that their organization the men in black was founded after first contact was made with aliens in at this time earth was established as a politically neutral zone for alien refugees
the mib is a secret organization that monitors and polices these aliens and use neuralyzers to erase the memories of anyone who witnesses alien activities
james agrees to join and he is renamed agent j and his civilian identity is erased from government records
meanwhile an alien crash lands in upstate new york kills a farmer named edgar and begins wearing his skin as a disguise
j and k investigate the crash site and discover this alien is a bug a species of cockroach like alien that is extremely dangerous
the bug kills two disguised aliens that are sent to a police morgue overseen by coroner laurel weaver
j and k inspect the bodies and j and laurel accidentally open the head of one revealing a small dying alien in a control cockpit
the alien tells them to prevent war the galaxy is on orion s belt before dying
k neuralyzes laurel telling j that this man was rosenberg an arquillian and one of their royal family
they question an informant frank the pug who explains that rosenberg was the guardian of a galaxy that is a precious source of sub atomic energy the bug killed rosenberg to acquire it so the bugs may destroy the arquillians
frank also tells them that the galaxy is on earth and is actually very small
an arquillian warship enters earth s orbit issuing an ultimatum to mib to give them the galaxy
j deduces the galaxy is in a jewel on the collar of rosenberg s cat orion hence rosenberg was trying to say bell which is in laurel s care now
the bug has made the same deduction and arrived at the morgue first and takes the galaxy and flees with laurel swallowing the galaxy
the arquillians who are willing to destroy the galaxy rather than let the bugs have it warn mib that they have one hour to recover the galaxy or they will destroy earth
with all other transports locked down j realizes the bug s only escape is the observation towers of the new york state pavilion at flushing meadows which was built for the new york world s fair to disguise two real flying saucers
the bug attempts to take off but j and k shoot down the ship and the bug sheds edgar s skin and reveals its true form
it swallows j and k s guns and k goads it to swallow him as well
the bug begins to board the second ship and j steps on cockroaches from a dumpster to antagonize it stalling until k finds his gun in its stomach and shoots it from inside
the remains of the bug attack the two but laurel destroys it with j s gun
with the galaxy secure k admits to j that he has not been training a partner but a replacement he is ready for retirement

laurel joins mib as j s new partner agent l
meanwhile out in the universe an arquillian is playing with some galaxy jewels like marbles
tommy lee jones as kevin brown agent k j s grizzled and humorless mentor
clint eastwood turned down the part while jones only accepted the role after steven spielberg promised the script would improve based on his respect for spielberg s track record
he had been disappointed with the first draft which he reportedly said stank feeling it did not capture the tone of the comic
will smith as james darrell edwards iii agent j a former nypd detective newly recruited to the mib
smith was cast because barry sonnenfeld s wife was a fan of the fresh prince of bel air
sonnenfeld also liked his performance in six degrees of separation
chris o donnell turned down the role because he found the role of a new recruit too similar to dick grayson whom he played in batman forever and batman robin

laurel weaver agent l a deputy medical examiner and later j s partner

producers walter f
parkes and laurie macdonald optioned the rights to the men in black in and hired ed solomon to write a very faithful script
parkes and macdonald wanted barry sonnenfeld as director because he had helmed the darkly humorous the addams family and its sequel addams family values
however sonnenfeld was attached to get shorty so they instead approached les mayfield to direct as they had heard about the positive reception to his remake of miracle on th street they actually saw the film later and decided he was inappropriate
as a result men in black was delayed so as to allow sonnenfeld to make it his next project after get shorty
much of the initial script drafts were set underground with locations ranging from kansas to washington d c
and nevada
sonnenfeld decided to change the location to new york city because the director felt new yorkers would be tolerant of aliens who behaved oddly while disguised
he also felt much of the city s structures resembled flying saucers and rocket ships
one of the locations sonnenfeld thought perfect for the movie was a giant ventilation structure for the brooklyn battery tunnel which became the outside of the mib headquarters
principal photography began in march
many last minute changes ensued during production
first the scene where james edwards chasing a disguised alien was to be filmed at lincoln center but the new york philharmonic decided to charge the filmmakers for using their buildings prompting sonnenfeld to film the scene at the solomon r
guggenheim museum instead
then five months into the shoot sonnenfeld decided that the original ending with a humorous existential debate between agent j and the bug was unexciting and lacking the action that the rest of the film had
five potential replacements were discussed
one of these had laurel weaver being neuralyzed and k remaining an agent
eventually it boiled down to the bug eating k and fighting j replacing the animatronic bug rick baker s crew had developed with a computer generated bug with an appearance closer to a cockroach
the whole action sequence cost an extra million to the filmmakers
further changes were made during post production to simplify the plotline involving the possession of the tiny galaxy
the arquillians would hand over the galaxy to the baltians ending a long war
the bugs need to feed on the casualties and steal the galaxy in order to continue the war
through changing of subtitles the images on m i b s main computer and frank the pug s dialogue the baltians were eliminated from the plot
earth goes from being potentially destroyed in the crossfire between the two races into being possibly destroyed by the arquillians themselves to prevent the bugs from getting the galaxy
these changes to the plot were carried out when only two weeks remained in the film s post production but the film s novelization still contains the baltians
production designer bo welch designed the mib headquarters with a s tone in mind because that was when their organization is formed
he cited influences from finnish architect eero saarinen who designed a terminal at john f
kennedy international airport
as the arrival point of aliens on earth welch felt the headquarters had to resemble an airport
rick baker was approached to provide the prosthetic and animatronic aliens many of whom would have more otherworldly designs instead of looking humanoid
for example the reveal of gentle rosenberg s arquillian nature went from a man with a light under his neck s skin to a small alien hidden inside a human head
baker would describe men in black as the most complex production in his career requiring more sketches than all my previous movies together
baker had to have approval from both sonnenfeld and spielberg it was like steven likes the head on this one and barry really likes the body on this one so why don t you do a mix and match and i d say because it wouldn t make any sense sonnenfeld also changed a lot of the film s aesthetic during pre production i started out saying aliens shouldn t be what humans perceive them to be
why do they need eyes so rick did these great designs and i d say that s great but how do we know where he s looking i ended up where everyone else did only i took three months the maquettes built by baker s team would later be digitized by industrial light magic who was responsible for the visual effects and computer generated imagery for more mobile digital versions of the aliens
two different soundtracks for the film were released a score soundtrack featuring music composed by danny elfman and an album of songs used in and inspired by the film featuring will smith s original song men in black based on the film s plot
elfman s music was called rousing by the los angeles times
variety called the film a technical marvel giving special credit to elfman s always lively score elfman was nominated for best original musical or comedy score at the th academy awards for his score
elfman recalled in how he was chosen to compose the soundtrack to be strange he was on the set of the frighteners with peter jackson when d onofrio who was shooting men in black on the other set walked in and invited both men to watch him perform the final scene
then on the way home elfman got a call from his agent saying that he was hired to compose the soundtrack even though there was no discussion about it prior
elvis presley s cover of promised land is featured in the scene where the mib s car runs on the ceiling of queens midtown tunnel

audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of b on an a to f scale
gene siskel of the chicago tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four praising the film as a smart funny and hip adventure film in a summer of car wrecks and explosions roger ebert of the chicago sun times gave the film three stars out of four giving particular praise to the film s self reflective humor and rick baker s alien creature designs
janet maslin reviewing for the new york times wrote the film is actually a shade more deadpan and peculiar than such across the board marketing makes it sound
it s also extraordinarily ambitious with all star design and special effects talent and a genuinely artful visual style
as with his addams family films and get shorty which were more overtly funny than the sneakily subtle men in black mr
sonnenfeld takes offbeat genre material and makes it boldly mainstream
writing for variety todd mccarthy acknowledged the film was witty and sometimes surreal sci fi comedy in which he praised the visual effects baker s creature designs and elfman s musical score
however he felt the film doesn t manage to sustain this level of inventiveness delight and surprise throughout the remaining two thirds of the picture owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly graded the film a c writing men in black celebrates the triumph of attitude over everything else plausibility passion any sense that what we re watching actually matters
the aliens for all their slimy visual zest aren t particularly scary or funny they aren t allowed to become characters and so the joke of watching smith and jones crack wise in their faces quickly wears thin john hartl of the seattle times claimed the film is moderately amusing well constructed and mercifully short but it fails to deliver on the zaniness of its first half while he was complimentary of the film s first half he concluded somewhere around the midpoint they run out of energy and invention
even the aliens once they stop their shape shifting ways and settle down to appear as themselves begin to look familiar
men in black won the academy award for best makeup and was also nominated for best original score and best art direction
