geomorphology from ancient greek g earth morph form and l gos study is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of topographic and bathymetric features created by physical chemical or biological processes operating at or near the earth s surface
geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do to understand landform and terrain history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations physical experiments and numerical modeling
geomorphologists work within disciplines such as physical geography geology geodesy engineering geology archaeology climatology and geotechnical engineering
this broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field
earth s surface is modified by a combination of surface processes that shape landscapes and geologic processes that cause tectonic uplift and subsidence and shape the coastal geography
surface processes comprise the action of water wind ice fire and life on the surface of the earth along with chemical reactions that form soils and alter material properties the stability and rate of change of topography under the force of gravity and other factors such as in the very recent past human alteration of the landscape
many of these factors are strongly mediated by climate
geologic processes include the uplift of mountain ranges the growth of volcanoes isostatic changes in land surface elevation sometimes in response to surface processes and the formation of deep sedimentary basins where the surface of the earth drops and is filled with material eroded from other parts of the landscape
the earth s surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic hydrologic and biologic action with geologic processes or alternatively stated the intersection of the earth s lithosphere with its hydrosphere atmosphere and biosphere
the broad scale topographies of the earth illustrate this intersection of surface and subsurface action
mountain belts are uplifted due to geologic processes
denudation of these high uplifted regions produces sediment that is transported and deposited elsewhere within the landscape or off the coast
on progressively smaller scales similar ideas apply where individual landforms evolve in response to the balance of additive processes uplift and deposition and subtractive processes subsidence and erosion
often these processes directly affect each other ice sheets water and sediment are all loads that change topography through flexural isostasy
topography can modify the local climate for example through orographic precipitation which in turn modifies the topography by changing the hydrologic regime in which it evolves
many geomorphologists are particularly interested in the potential for feedbacks between climate and tectonics mediated by geomorphic processes
in addition to these broad scale questions geomorphologists address issues that are more specific and or more local
glacial geomorphologists investigate glacial deposits such as moraines eskers and proglacial lakes as well as glacial erosional features to build chronologies of both small glaciers and large ice sheets and understand their motions and effects upon the landscape
fluvial geomorphologists focus on rivers how they transport sediment migrate across the landscape cut into bedrock respond to environmental and tectonic changes and interact with humans
soils geomorphologists investigate soil profiles and chemistry to learn about the history of a particular landscape and understand how climate biota and rock interact
other geomorphologists study how hillslopes form and change
still others investigate the relationships between ecology and geomorphology
because geomorphology is defined to comprise everything related to the surface of the earth and its modification it is a broad field with many facets
geomorphologists use a wide range of techniques in their work
these may include fieldwork and field data collection the interpretation of remotely sensed data geochemical analyses and the numerical modelling of the physics of landscapes
geomorphologists may rely on geochronology using dating methods to measure the rate of changes to the surface
terrain measurement techniques are vital to quantitatively describe the form of the earth s surface and include differential gps remotely sensed digital terrain models and laser scanning to quantify study and to generate illustrations and maps
practical applications of geomorphology include hazard assessment such as landslide prediction and mitigation river control and stream restoration and coastal protection
planetary geomorphology studies landforms on other terrestrial planets such as mars
indications of effects of wind fluvial glacial mass wasting meteor impact tectonics and volcanic processes are studied
this effort not only helps better understand the geologic and atmospheric history of those planets but also extends geomorphological study of the earth
planetary geomorphologists often use earth analogues to aid in their study of surfaces of other planets
other than some notable exceptions in antiquity geomorphology is a relatively young science growing along with interest in other aspects of the earth sciences in the mid th century
this section provides a very brief outline of some of the major figures and events in its development
the study of landforms and the evolution of the earth s surface can be dated back to scholars of classical greece
in the th century bc greek historian herodotus argued from observations of soils that the nile delta was actively growing into the mediterranean sea and estimated its age
in the th century bc greek philosopher aristotle speculated that due to sediment transport into the sea eventually those seas would fill while the land lowered
he claimed that this would mean that land and water would eventually swap places whereupon the process would begin again in an endless cycle
the encyclopedia of the brethren of purity published in arabic at basra during the th century also discussed the cyclical changing positions of land and sea with rocks breaking down and being washed into the sea their sediment eventually rising to form new continents
the medieval persian muslim scholar ab rayh n al b r n after observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers hypothesized that the indian ocean once covered all of india
in his de natura fossilium of german metallurgist and mineralogist georgius agricola wrote about erosion and natural weathering
another early theory of geomorphology was devised by song dynasty chinese scientist and statesman shen kuo
this was based on his observation of marine fossil shells in a geological stratum of a mountain hundreds of miles from the pacific ocean
noticing bivalve shells running in a horizontal span along the cut section of a cliffside he theorized that the cliff was once the pre historic location of a seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles over the centuries
he inferred that the land was reshaped and formed by soil erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt after observing strange natural erosions of the taihang mountains and the yandang mountain near wenzhou
furthermore he promoted the theory of gradual climate change over centuries of time once ancient petrified bamboos were found to be preserved underground in the dry northern climate zone of yanzhou which is now modern day yan an shaanxi province
previous chinese authors also presented ideas about changing landforms
scholar official du yu of the western jin dynasty predicted that two monumental stelae recording his achievements one buried at the foot of a mountain and the other erected at the top would eventually change their relative positions over time as would hills and valleys
daoist alchemist ge hong created a fictional dialogue where the immortal magu explained that the territory of the east china sea was once a land filled with mulberry trees
the term geomorphology seems to have been first used by laumann in an work written in german
keith tinkler has suggested that the word came into general use in english german and french after john wesley powell and w
mcgee used it during the international geological conference of
john edward marr in his the scientific study of scenery considered his book as an introductory treatise on geomorphology a subject which has sprung from the union of geology and geography
an early popular geomorphic model was the geographical cycle or cycle of erosion model of broad scale landscape evolution developed by william morris davis between and
it was an elaboration of the uniformitarianism theory that had first been proposed by james hutton
with regard to valley forms for example uniformitarianism posited a sequence in which a river runs through a flat terrain gradually carving an increasingly deep valley until the side valleys eventually erode flattening the terrain again though at a lower elevation
it was thought that tectonic uplift could then start the cycle over
in the decades following davis s development of this idea many of those studying geomorphology sought to fit their findings into this framework known today as davisian
davis s ideas are of historical importance but have been largely superseded today mainly due to their lack of predictive power and qualitative nature
in the s walther penck developed an alternative model to davis s
penck thought that landform evolution was better described as an alternation between ongoing processes of uplift and denudation as opposed to davis s model of a single uplift followed by decay
he also emphasised that in many landscapes slope evolution occurs by backwearing of rocks not by davisian style surface lowering and his science tended to emphasise surface process over understanding in detail the surface history of a given locality
penck was german and during his lifetime his ideas were at times rejected vigorously by the english speaking geomorphology community
his early death davis dislike for his work and his at times confusing writing style likely all contributed to this rejection
both davis and penck were trying to place the study of the evolution of the earth s surface on a more generalized globally relevant footing than it had been previously
in the early th century authors especially in europe had tended to attribute the form of landscapes to local climate and in particular to the specific effects of glaciation and periglacial processes
in contrast both davis and penck were seeking to emphasize the importance of evolution of landscapes through time and the generality of the earth s surface processes across different landscapes under different conditions
during the early s the study of regional scale geomorphology was termed physiography
physiography later was considered to be a contraction of physical and geography and therefore synonymous with physical geography and the concept became embroiled in controversy surrounding the appropriate concerns of that discipline
some geomorphologists held to a geological basis for physiography and emphasized a concept of physiographic regions while a conflicting trend among geographers was to equate physiography with pure morphology separated from its geological heritage
in the period following world war ii the emergence of process climatic and quantitative studies led to a preference by many earth scientists for the term geomorphology in order to suggest an analytical approach to landscapes rather than a descriptive one
during the age of new imperialism in the late th century european explorers and scientists traveled across the globe bringing descriptions of landscapes and landforms
as geographical knowledge increased over time these observations were systematized in a search for regional patterns
climate emerged thus as prime factor for explaining landform distribution at a grand scale
the rise of climatic geomorphology was foreshadowed by the work of wladimir k ppen vasily dokuchaev and andreas schimper
william morris davis the leading geomorphologist of his time recognized the role of climate by complementing his normal temperate climate cycle of erosion with arid and glacial ones
nevertheless interest in climatic geomorphology was also a reaction against davisian geomorphology that was by the mid th century considered both un innovative and dubious
early climatic geomorphology developed primarily in continental europe while in the english speaking world the tendency was not explicit until l c
peltier s publication on a periglacial cycle of erosion
climatic geomorphology was criticized in a review article by process geomorphologist d r
stoddart
the criticism by stoddart proved devastating sparking a decline in the popularity of climatic geomorphology in the late th century
stoddart criticized climatic geomorphology for applying supposedly trivial methodologies in establishing landform differences between morphoclimatic zones being linked to davisian geomorphology and by allegedly neglecting the fact that physical laws governing processes are the same across the globe
in addition some conceptions of climatic geomorphology like that which holds that chemical weathering is more rapid in tropical climates than in cold climates proved to not be straightforwardly true
geomorphology was started to be put on a solid quantitative footing in the middle of the th century
following the early work of grove karl gilbert around the turn of the th century a group of mainly american natural scientists geologists and hydraulic engineers including william walden rubey ralph alger bagnold hans albert einstein frank ahnert john hack luna leopold a
shields thomas maddock arthur strahler stanley schumm and ronald shreve began to research the form of landscape elements such as rivers and hillslopes by taking systematic direct quantitative measurements of aspects of them and investigating the scaling of these measurements
these methods began to allow prediction of the past and future behavior of landscapes from present observations and were later to develop into the modern trend of a highly quantitative approach to geomorphic problems
many groundbreaking and widely cited early geomorphology studies appeared in the bulletin of the geological society of america and received only few citations prior to they are examples of sleeping beauties when a marked increase in quantitative geomorphology research occurred
quantitative geomorphology can involve fluid dynamics and solid mechanics geomorphometry laboratory studies field measurements theoretical work and full landscape evolution modeling
these approaches are used to understand weathering and the formation of soils sediment transport landscape change and the interactions between climate tectonics erosion and deposition
in sweden filip hjulstr m s doctoral thesis the river fyris contained one of the first quantitative studies of geomorphological processes ever published
his students followed in the same vein making quantitative studies of mass transport anders rapp fluvial transport ke sundborg delta deposition valter axelsson and coastal processes john o
norrman
this developed into the uppsala school of physical geography
today the field of geomorphology encompasses a very wide range of different approaches and interests
modern researchers aim to draw out quantitative laws that govern earth surface processes but equally recognize the uniqueness of each landscape and environment in which these processes operate
particularly important realizations in contemporary geomorphology include
that not all landscapes can be considered as either stable or perturbed where this perturbed state is a temporary displacement away from some ideal target form
instead dynamic changes of the landscape are now seen as an essential part of their nature that many geomorphic systems are best understood in terms of the stochasticity of the processes occurring in them that is the probability distributions of event magnitudes and return times
this in turn has indicated the importance of chaotic determinism to landscapes and that landscape properties are best considered statistically
the same processes in the same landscapes do not always lead to the same end results according to karna lidmar bergstr m regional geography is since the s no longer accepted by mainstream scholarship as a basis for geomorphological studies
albeit having its importance diminished climatic geomorphology continues to exist as field of study producing relevant research
more recently concerns over global warming have led to a renewed interest in the field
despite considerable criticism the cycle of erosion model has remained part of the science of geomorphology
the model or theory has never been proved wrong but neither has it been proven
the inherent difficulties of the model have instead made geomorphological research to advance along other lines
in contrast to its disputed status in geomorphology the cycle of erosion model is a common approach used to establish denudation chronologies and is thus an important concept in the science of historical geology
while acknowledging its shortcomings modern geomorphologists andrew goudie and karna lidmar bergstr m have praised it for its elegance and pedagogical value respectively
geomorphically relevant processes generally fall into
the production of regolith by weathering and erosion
the transport of that material and
its eventual deposition
primary surface processes responsible for most topographic features include wind waves chemical dissolution mass wasting groundwater movement surface water flow glacial action tectonism and volcanism
other more exotic geomorphic processes might include periglacial freeze thaw processes salt mediated action changes to the seabed caused by marine currents seepage of fluids through the seafloor or extraterrestrial impact
aeolian processes pertain to the activity of the winds and more specifically to the winds ability to shape the surface of the earth
winds may erode transport and deposit materials and are effective agents in regions with sparse vegetation and a large supply of fine unconsolidated sediments
although water and mass flow tend to mobilize more material than wind in most environments aeolian processes are important in arid environments such as deserts
the interaction of living organisms with landforms or biogeomorphologic processes can be of many different forms and is probably of profound importance for the terrestrial geomorphic system as a whole
biology can influence very many geomorphic processes ranging from biogeochemical processes controlling chemical weathering to the influence of mechanical processes like burrowing and tree throw on soil development to even controlling global erosion rates through modulation of climate through carbon dioxide balance
terrestrial landscapes in which the role of biology in mediating surface processes can be definitively excluded are extremely rare but may hold important information for understanding the geomorphology of other planets such as mars
rivers and streams are not only conduits of water but also of sediment
the water as it flows over the channel bed is able to mobilize sediment and transport it downstream either as bed load suspended load or dissolved load
the rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and on the river s discharge
rivers are also capable of eroding into rock and creating new sediment both from their own beds and also by coupling to the surrounding hillslopes
in this way rivers are thought of as setting the base level for large scale landscape evolution in nonglacial environments
rivers are key links in the connectivity of different landscape elements
as rivers flow across the landscape they generally increase in size merging with other rivers
the network of rivers thus formed is a drainage system
these systems take on four general patterns dendritic radial rectangular and trellis
dendritic happens to be the most common occurring when the underlying stratum is stable without faulting
drainage systems have four primary components drainage basin alluvial valley delta plain and receiving basin
some geomorphic examples of fluvial landforms are alluvial fans oxbow lakes and fluvial terraces
glaciers while geographically restricted are effective agents of landscape change
the gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock
abrasion produces fine sediment termed glacial flour
the debris transported by the glacier when the glacier recedes is termed a moraine
glacial erosion is responsible for u shaped valleys as opposed to the v shaped valleys of fluvial origin
the way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements particularly hillslope and fluvial processes is an important aspect of plio pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments
environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated
nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes
this concept contrasts with periglacial processes which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost
soil regolith and rock move downslope under the force of gravity via creep slides flows topples and falls
such mass wasting occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes and has been observed on earth mars venus titan and iapetus
ongoing hillslope processes can change the topology of the hillslope surface which in turn can change the rates of those processes
hillslopes that steepen up to certain critical thresholds are capable of shedding extremely large volumes of material very quickly making hillslope processes an extremely important element of landscapes in tectonically active areas
on the earth biological processes such as burrowing or tree throw may play important roles in setting the rates of some hillslope processes
both volcanic eruptive and plutonic intrusive igneous processes can have important impacts on geomorphology
the action of volcanoes tends to rejuvenize landscapes covering the old land surface with lava and tephra releasing pyroclastic material and forcing rivers through new paths
the cones built by eruptions also build substantial new topography which can be acted upon by other surface processes
plutonic rocks intruding then solidifying at depth can cause both uplift or subsidence of the surface depending on whether the new material is denser or less dense than the rock it displaces
tectonic effects on geomorphology can range from scales of millions of years to minutes or less
the effects of tectonics on landscape are heavily dependent on the nature of the underlying bedrock fabric that more or less controls what kind of local morphology tectonics can shape
earthquakes can in terms of minutes submerge large areas of land creating new wetlands
isostatic rebound can account for significant changes over hundreds to thousands of years and allows erosion of a mountain belt to promote further erosion as mass is removed from the chain and the belt uplifts
long term plate tectonic dynamics give rise to orogenic belts large mountain chains with typical lifetimes of many tens of millions of years which form focal points for high rates of fluvial and hillslope processes and thus long term sediment production
features of deeper mantle dynamics such as plumes and delamination of the lower lithosphere have also been hypothesised to play important roles in the long term million year large scale thousands of km evolution of the earth s topography see dynamic topography
both can promote surface uplift through isostasy as hotter less dense mantle rocks displace cooler denser mantle rocks at depth in the earth
marine processes are those associated with the action of waves marine currents and seepage of fluids through the seafloor
mass wasting and submarine landsliding are also important processes for some aspects of marine geomorphology
because ocean basins are the ultimate sinks for a large fraction of terrestrial sediments depositional processes and their related forms e g sediment fans deltas are particularly important as elements of marine geomorphology
there is a considerable overlap between geomorphology and other fields
deposition of material is extremely important in sedimentology
weathering is the chemical and physical disruption of earth materials in place on exposure to atmospheric or near surface agents and is typically studied by soil scientists and environmental chemists but is an essential component of geomorphology because it is what provides the material that can be moved in the first place
civil and environmental engineers are concerned with erosion and sediment transport especially related to canals slope stability and natural hazards water quality coastal environmental management transport of contaminants and stream restoration
glaciers can cause extensive erosion and deposition in a short period of time making them extremely important entities in the high latitudes and meaning that they set the conditions in the headwaters of mountain born streams glaciology therefore is important in geomorphology
