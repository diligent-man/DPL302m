century bc greek philosopher aristotle speculated due sediment transport sea eventually sea would fill land lowered
claimed would mean land water would eventually swap place whereupon process would begin endless cycle

john edward marr scientific study scenery considered book 'an introductory treatise geomorphology subject ha sprung union geology geography'
early popular geomorphic model wa geographical cycle cycle erosion model broad-scale landscape evolution developed william morris davis and
wa elaboration uniformitarianism theory first proposed james hutton
regard valley form example uniformitarianism posited sequence river run flat terrain gradually carving increasingly deep valley side valley eventually erode flattening terrain though lower elevation
wa thought tectonic uplift could start cycle over
decade following davis's development idea many studying geomorphology sought fit finding framework known today davisian
davis's idea historical importance largely superseded today mainly due lack predictive power qualitative nature
penck thought landform evolution wa better described alternation ongoing process uplift denudation opposed davis's model single uplift followed decay
also emphasised many landscape slope evolution occurs backwearing rock davisian-style surface lowering science tended emphasise surface process understanding detail surface history given locality
penck wa german lifetime idea time rejected vigorously english-speaking geomorphology community
early death davis' dislike work at-times-confusing writing style likely contributed rejection
davis penck trying place study evolution earth's surface generalized globally relevant footing previously
early century author especially europe tended attribute form landscape local climate particular specific effect glaciation periglacial processes
contrast davis penck seeking emphasize importance evolution landscape time generality earth's surface process across different landscape different conditions
physiography later wa considered contraction physical geography therefore synonymous physical geography concept became embroiled controversy surrounding appropriate concern discipline
geomorphologists held geological basis physiography emphasized concept physiographic region conflicting trend among geographer wa equate physiography pure morphology separated geological heritage
