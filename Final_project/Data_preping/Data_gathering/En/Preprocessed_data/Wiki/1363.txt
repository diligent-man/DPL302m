twelve daily newspapers and eleven sunday only weekly newspapers are distributed nationally in the united kingdom
others circulate in scotland only and still others serve smaller areas
national daily newspapers publish every day except sundays and december
sunday newspapers may be independent e g
the observer was an independent sunday newspaper from its founding in until it was acquired by the guardian in
many daily newspapers now have sunday editions usually with a related name e g
the times and the sunday times but are editorially distinct
uk newspapers can generally be split into two distinct categories the more serious and intellectual newspapers usually referred to as the broadsheets and sometimes known collectively as the quality press and others generally known as tabloids and collectively as the popular press which have tended to focus more on celebrity coverage and human interest stories rather than political reporting or overseas news
the tabloids in turn have been divided into the more sensationalist mass market titles or red tops such as the sun and the daily mirror and the middle market papers the daily express and the daily mail
most of the broadsheets so called because of their historically larger size have changed in recent years to a compact format the same size as the tabloids
the independent and the times were the first to do so
the guardian moved in september to what is described as a berliner format slightly larger than a compact
its sunday stablemate the observer followed suit
both the guardian and the observer now use the tabloid format having done so since january
despite these format changes these newspapers are all still considered broadsheets
other sunday broadsheets including the sunday times which tend to have a large amount of supplementary sections have kept their larger sized format
the national sunday titles usually have a different layout and style from their weekly sister papers and are produced by separate journalistic and editorial staff
all the major uk newspapers currently have websites some of which provide free access
the times and the sunday times have a paywall requiring payment on a per day or per month basis by non subscribers
the financial times business daily also has limited access for non subscribers
the independent became available online only upon its last printed edition on march
however unlike the previously mentioned newspapers it does not require any payment to access its news content
instead the newspaper offers extras for those wishing to sign up to a payment subscription such as crosswords sudoku puzzles weekend supplements and the ability to automatically download each daily edition to read offline
most towns and cities in the uk have at least one local newspaper such as the evening post in bristol and the echo in cardiff
they are not known nationally for their journalism in the way that despite much syndication some city based newspapers in the usa are e g
the new york times the washington post the boston globe los angeles times
an exception to this was the manchester guardian which dropped the manchester from its name in and relocated its main operations to london in
the guardian media group produced a mancunian paper the manchester evening news until when along with its other local newspapers in the greater manchester area it was sold to trinity mirror
