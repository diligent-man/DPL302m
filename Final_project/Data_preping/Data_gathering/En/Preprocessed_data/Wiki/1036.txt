The Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon French Mandat pour la Syrie et le Liban Arabic الانتداب الفرنسي على سوريا ولبنان romanized al-intidāb al-fransi 'ala suriya wa-lubnān − was a League of Nations mandate founded in the aftermath of the First World War and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire concerning Syria and Lebanon
The mandate system was supposed to differ from colonialism with the governing country intended to act as a trustee until the inhabitants were considered eligible for self-government
At that point the mandate would terminate and an independent state would be born
During the two years that followed the end of the war in —and in accordance with the SykesPicot Agreement signed by Britain and France during the war—the British held control of most of Ottoman Mesopotamia modern Iraq and the southern part of Ottoman Syria Palestine and Transjordan while the French controlled the rest of Ottoman Syria Lebanon Alexandretta Hatay and portions of southeastern Turkey
In the early s British and French control of these territories became formalized by the League of Nations' mandate system and on September France was assigned the League of Nations mandate of Syria which included the territory of present-day Lebanon and Alexandretta in addition to modern Syria
The administration of the region under the French was carried out through a number of different governments and territories including the Syrian Federation the State of Syria and the Syrian Republic as well as smaller states the State of Greater Lebanon the Alawite State and Jabal Druze State
Hatay State was annexed by Turkey in
The French mandate lasted until when two independent countries emerged Syria and Lebanon
French troops eventually left Syria and Lebanon in
With the defeat of the Ottomans in Syria British troops under General Sir Edmund Allenby entered Damascus in accompanied by troops of the Arab Revolt led by Faisal son of Sharif Hussein of Mecca
Faisal established the first new postwar Arab government in Damascus in October and named Ali Rida Pasha ar-Rikabi a military governor
The new Arab administration formed local governments in the major Syrian cities and the pan-Arab flag was raised all over Syria
The Arabs hoped with faith in earlier British promises that the new Arab state would include all the Arab lands stretching from Aleppo in northern Syria to Aden in southern Yemen
However in accordance with the secret SykesPicot Agreement between Britain and France General Allenby assigned to the Arab administration only the interior regions of Syria the eastern zone
Palestine the southern zone was reserved for the British
On October French troops disembarked in Beirut and occupied the Lebanese coastal region south to Naqoura the western zone replacing British troops there
The French immediately dissolved the local Arab governments in the region
France demanded full implementation of the SykesPicot Agreement with Syria under its control
On November British forces withdrew from Damascus to avoid confrontation with the French leaving the Arab government to face France
Faisal had travelled several times to Europe since November trying to convince France and Britain to change their positions but without success
France's determination to intervene in Syria was shown by the naming of General Henri Gouraud as high commissioner in Syria and Cilicia
At the Paris Peace Conference Faisal found himself in an even weaker position when the European powers decided to renege on the promises made to the Arabs
In May elections were held for the Syrian National Congress which convened in Damascus
However the minority included dynamic Arab nationalist figures such as Jamil Mardam Bey Shukri al-Kuwatli Ahmad al-Qadri Ibrahim Hanano and Riyad as-Solh
The head was moderate nationalist Hashim al-Atassi
In June the American KingCrane Commission arrived in Syria to inquire into local public opinion about the future of the country
The commission's remit extended from Aleppo to Beersheba
They visited major cities met with more than delegations from more than villages and received more than petitions
Their conclusions confirmed the opposition of Syrians to the mandate in their country as well as to the Balfour Declaration and their demand for a unified Greater Syria encompassing Palestine
The conclusions of the commission were ignored by both Britain and France
Unrest erupted in Syria when Faisal accepted a compromise with French Prime Minister Clemenceau
Anti-Hashemite demonstrations broke out and Muslim inhabitants in and around Mount Lebanon revolted in fear of being incorporated into a new mainly Christian state of Greater Lebanon
A part of France's claim to these territories in the Levant was that France had been acknowledged as a protector of the minority Christian communities by the Ottoman Empire
In March the Congress in Damascus adopted a resolution rejecting the Faisal-Clemenceau accords
The congress declared the independence of Syria in her natural borders including Southern Syria or Palestine and proclaimed Faisal the king of all Arabs
Faisal invited Ali Rida al-Rikabi to form a government
The congress also proclaimed political and economic union with neighboring Iraq and demanded its independence as well
On April the supreme inter-Allied council which was formulating the Treaty of Svres granted France the mandate of Syria including Lebanon and granted Britain the Mandate of Palestine including Jordan and Iraq
Syrians reacted with violent demonstrations and a new government headed by Hashim al-Atassi was formed on May
The new government decided to organize general conscription and began forming an army
These decisions provoked adverse reactions by France as well as by the Maronite patriarchate of Mount Lebanon which denounced the decisions as a coup d'tat
In Beirut the Christian press expressed its hostility to the decisions of Faisal's government
Lebanese nationalists used the crisis against Faisal's government to convene a council of Christian figures in Baabda that proclaimed the independence of Lebanon on March
On July General Gouraud issued an ultimatum to Faisal giving him the choice between submission or abdication
Realizing that the power balance was not in his favor Faisal chose to cooperate
However the young minister of war Youssef al-Azmeh refused to comply
In the resulting Franco-Syrian War Syrian troops under al-Azmeh composed of the little remaining troops of the Arab army along with Bedouin horsemen and civilian volunteers met the better trained -strong French forces under General Mariano Goybet at the Battle of Maysaloun
The French won the battle in less than a day and Azmeh died on the battlefield along with many of the Syrian troops while the remaining troops possibly defected
General Goybet captured Damascus with little resistance on July and the mandate was written in London two years later on July
Arriving in Lebanon the French were received as liberators by the Christian community but in the rest of Syria they were faced with strong resistance
The mandate region was subdivided into six states
They were the states of Damascus Aleppo Alawites Jabal Druze the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta modern-day Hatay and the State of Greater Lebanon which became later the modern country of Lebanon
The borders of these states were based in part on the sectarian geography in Syria
Many of the different Syrian sects were hostile to the French mandate and to the division it created as shown by the numerous revolts that the French encountered in all of the Syrian states
The Maronite Christians of Mount Lebanon on the other hand were a community with a dream of independence that was being realized under the French therefore Greater Lebanon was the exception among the newly formed states
It took France three years from to to gain full control over Syria and to quell all the insurgencies that broke out notably in the Alawite territories Mount Druze and Aleppo
Although there were uprisings in the different states the French deliberately gave different ethnic and religious groups in the Levant their own lands in the hopes of prolonging their rule
The French hoped to fragment the various groups in the region to mitigate support for the Syrian nationalist movement seeking to end colonial rule
The administration of the state governments was heavily dominated by the French
Local authorities were given very little power and did not have the authority to independently decide policy
The small amount of power that local leaders had could easily be overruled by French officials
The French did everything in their power to prevent people in the Levant from developing self-sufficient governing bodies
On August Arrt of the Haut-commissariat de la Rpublique franaise en Syrie et au Liban linked the cazas of Hasbaya Rachaya Maallaka and Baalbeck to what was then known as the Autonomous Territory of Lebanon
Then on August General Gouraud signed Arrt delimiting the State of Greater Lebanon with explanatory notes stating that Lebanon would be treated separately from the rest of Syria
On September General Gouraud publicly proclaimed the creation of the State of Greater Lebanon French tat du Grand Liban Arabic دولة لبنان الكبير at a ceremony in Beirut
Greater Lebanon was created by France to be a safe haven for the Maronite population of the mutasarrifia Ottoman administrative unit of Mount Lebanon
Lebanon an area with a Maronite majority had enjoyed varying degrees of autonomy during the Ottoman era
However in addition to the Maronite Mutasarrifia other mainly Muslim regions were added forming Greater Lebanon
Those regions correspond today to North Lebanon south Lebanon Biqa' valley and Beirut
The capital of Greater Lebanon was Beirut
The new state was granted a flag merging the French flag with the cedar of Lebanon
Maronites were the majority in Lebanon and managed to preserve its independence an independence that created a unique precedent in the Arab world as Lebanon was the first Arab country in which Christians were not a minority
The State of Greater Lebanon existed until May after which it became the Lebanese Republic
Most Muslims in Greater Lebanon rejected the new state upon its creation
Some believe that the continuous Muslim demand for reunification with Syria eventually brought about an armed conflict between Muslims and Christians in when Lebanese Muslims wanted to join the newly proclaimed United Arab Republic while Lebanese Christians were strongly opposed
However most members of the Lebanese Muslim communities and their political elites were committed to the idea of being Lebanese citizens by the late s even though they also tended to nurture Arab nationalist sentiments
On August General Gouraud signed Arrt which added to the autonomous sandjak of Alexandretta the cazas of Jisr el-Choughour the madriyehs of Baher and Bujack caza of Latakia the moudiriyeh of Kinsaba caza of Sahyoun with a view to the formation of the territories of Greater Lebanon and the Ansarieh Mountains where the Ansarieh Mountains area was to become the Alawite State
On August the same day that the decree creating Greater Lebanon was signed General Gouraud signed Arrt delimiting the State of Alawites and Arrt adding the caza of Massyaf Omranie into the new State
The State of Alawites French tat des Alaouites Arabic دولة العلويين was located on the Syrian coast and incorporated a majority of Alawites a branch of Shia Islam
The port city of Latakia was the capital of this state
Initially it was an autonomous territory under French rule known as the Alawite Territories
It became part of the Syrian Federation in but left the federation again in and became the State of Alawites
On September it was renamed the Independent Government of Latakia
The government of Latakia finally joined the Syrian Republic on December
This state witnessed several rebellions against the French including that of Salih al-Ali
On June Arrt created a Federation of the Autonomous States of Syria which included the State of Aleppo the State of Damascus and the State of the Alawis
However two and a half years later on December Arrt and Arrt establishing the Alawite State as an independent state with Latakia as its capital and separately unified the States of Aleppo and Damascus as from January into a single State renamed d'tat de Syrie State of Syria
In both Jebel Druze and the Alawite State were incorporated into the State of Syria
On September the day after the creation of Greater Lebanon and the Alawite State Arrt separated out of the previous Gouvernement de Damas Government of Damascus an independent government known as the Gouvernement d'Alep Government of Aleppo including the autonomous sandjak of Alexandretta which retained its administrative autonomy
The terms Gouvernement d'Alep Gouvernement de Damas were used interchangeably with l'tat d'Alep and l'tat de Damas for example Arrete October stated in its preamble Vu l'arrt No du er Septembre crant l'tat d'Alep
The State of Aleppo French tat d'Alep Arabic دولة حلب included a majority of Sunni Muslims
It covered northern Syria in addition to the entire fertile basin of river Euphrates of eastern Syria
These regions represented much of the agricultural and mineral wealth of Syria
The autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta was added to the state of Aleppo in
The capital was the northern city of Aleppo which had large Christian and Jewish communities in addition to the Sunni Muslims
The state also incorporated minorities of Shiites and Alawites
Ethnic Kurds and Assyrians inhabited the eastern regions alongside the Arabs
The General Governors of the state were Kamil Pasha al-Qudsi Mustafa Bey Barmada and Mar'i Pasha Al Mallah -
The State of Damascus was a French mandate from to
The primarily Sunni population of the states of Aleppo and Damascus were strongly opposed to the division of Syria
This resulted in its quick end in when France united the states of Aleppo and Damascus into the State of Syria
The Sanjak of Alexandretta became an autonomous province of Syria under Article of the French-Turkish treaty of October A special administrative regime shall be established for the district of Alexandretta
The Turkish inhabitants of this district shall enjoy facility for their cultural development
The Turkish language shall have official recognition
In Alexandretta was attached to the State of Aleppo and in it was directly attached to the French mandate of Syria still with special administrative status
The sanjak was given autonomy in November in an arrangement brokered by the League
Under its new statute the sanjak became 'distinct but not separated' from the French Mandate of Syria on the diplomatic level linked to both France and Turkey for defence matters
In the Turkish military went into the Syrian province and expelled most of its Alawite Arab and Armenian inhabitants
Before this Alawi Arabs and Armenians were the majority of Alexandretta's population
The allocation of seats in the sanjak assembly was based on the census held by the French authorities under international supervision
The assembly was appointed in the summer of and the French-Turkish treaty settling the status of the Sanjak was signed on July
On September the assembly proclaimed the Sanjak of Alexandretta as the Hatay State
The republic lasted for one year under joint French and Turkish military supervision
The name Hatay itself was proposed by Atatrk and the government was under Turkish control
In following a popular referendum the Hatay State became a Turkish province
On October Arrt established the tat autonome du Djebel druze Autonomous State of Jabal Druze
It was created for the Druze population of southern Syria
It had a population of some and its capital in As-Suwayda
In both Jebel Druze and the Alawite State were incorporated into the State of Syria
In there was some autonomist agitation among Assyrians and Kurds supported by some Bedouins in the province of Al-Jazira
Its partisans wanted the French troops to stay in the province in the event of a Syrian independence as they feared the nationalist Damascus government would replace minority officials by Muslim Arabs from the capital
The French authorities refused to consider any new status of autonomy inside Syria
In Quneitra and the Golan Region there was a sizeable Circassian community
For the same reasons as their Assyrian Kurdish and Bedouin counterparts in Al-Jazira province in several Circassian leaders wanted a special autonomy status for their region in as they feared the prospect of living in an independent Syrian republic under a nationalist Arab government hostile towards the minorities
They also wanted the Golan region to become a national homeland for Circassian refugees from the Caucasus
A Circassian battalion served in the French Army of the Levant and had helped it against the Arab nationalist uprisings
As in Al-Jazira Province the French authorities refused to grant any autonomy status to the Golan Circassians
