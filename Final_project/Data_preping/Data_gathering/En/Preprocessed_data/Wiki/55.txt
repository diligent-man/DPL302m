koryaks or koriak russian are an indigenous people of the russian far east who live immediately north of the kamchatka peninsula in kamchatka krai and inhabit the coastlands of the bering sea
the cultural borders of the koryaks include tigilsk in the south and the anadyr basin in the north
the koryaks are culturally similar to the chukchis of extreme northeast siberia
the koryak language and alutor which is often regarded as a dialect of koryak are linguistically close to the chukchi language
all of these languages are members of the chukotko kamchatkan language family
they are more distantly related to the itelmens on the kamchatka peninsula
all of these peoples and other unrelated minorities in and around kamchatka are known collectively as kamchadals
neighbors of the koryaks include the evens to the west the alutor to the south on the isthmus of kamchatka peninsula the kerek to the east and the chukchi to the northeast
the koryak are typically split into two groups
the coastal people are called nemelan or nymylan meaning village dwellers due to their living in villages
their lifestyle is based on local fishing and marine mammal hunting
the inland koryak reindeer herders are called chaucu or chauchuven meaning rich in reindeer
they are more nomadic following the herds as they graze with the seasons
according to the census there were koryaks in russia
the name koryak was from the exonym word korak meaning with the reindeer kor in a nearby group chukotko kamchatkan language
the earliest references to the name koryak were recorded in the writings of the russian cossack vladimir atlasov who conquered kamchatka for the tsar in
the variant name was adopted by russia in official state documents hence popularizing it ever since
the origin of the koryak is unknown
anthropologists have speculated that a land bridge connected the eurasian and north american continent during late pleistocene
it is possible that migratory peoples crossed the modern day koryak land en route to north america
scientists have suggested that people traveled back and forth between this area and haida gwaii before the ice age receded
they theorize that the ancestors of the koryak had returned to siberian asia from north america during this time
cultural and some linguistic similarity exist between the nivkh and the koryak
the koryak once occupied a much larger area of the russian far east
their overlapping borders extended to the nivkh areas in khabarovsk krai until the evens arrived and pushed them into their present region
a smallpox epidemic in and warfare with russian cossacks reduced the koryak population from in to in
under the soviet union a koryak autonomous okrug was formed in and named for this people
based on the local referendum in this was merged with kamchatka krai effective july
families usually gathered into groups of six or seven forming bands
the nominal chief had no predominating authority and the groups relied on consensus to make decisions resembling common small group egalitarianism
the lives of the people in the interior revolved around reindeer their main source of food
they also used all the parts of its body to make sewing materials and clothing tools and weapons
the meat was mostly eaten roasted and the blood marrow and milk were drunk or eaten raw
the liver heart kidneys and tongue were considered delicacies
salmon and other freshwater fish as well as berries and roots played a major part in the diet as reindeer flesh did not contain some necessary vitamins and minerals nor dietary fibre needed to survive in the harsh tundra
today the koryaks also buy processed food such as bread cereal and canned fish
they sell some reindeer each year for money but can build up their herds due to the large population of reindeer
clothing was made out of reindeer hides but nowadays men and women often have replaced that with cloth
the men wore baggy pants and a hide shirt which often had a hood attached to it boots and traditional caps made of reindeer skin
they still use the boots and caps
the women wore the same as the men but with a longer shirt reaching to the calves
today women often wear a head cloth and skirt but wear the reindeer skin robe in cold weather
the koryak lived in domed shaped tents called jajanga or yaranga from the more famous chukchi term similar to a tipi of the american plains indians but less vertical while some lived in yurts
the framework was covered in many reindeer skins
few families still use the yaranga as dwellings but some use them for trips to the tundra
the centre of the yaranga had a hearth which has been replaced by an iron stove
reindeer hide beds are placed to the east in the chum
they used small cupboards to store the families food clothing and personal items
the inland koryak rode reindeer to get around cutting off their antlers to prevent injuries
they also fitted a team of reindeer with harnesses and attached them to sleds to transport goods and people when moving camp
today the koryak use snowmobiles more often than reindeer
most inter village transport is by air or boat although tracked vehicles are used for travel to neighboring villages
they developed snowshoes which they used in winter and still do when the snow is deep
snowshoes are made by lashing reindeer sinew and hide strips to a tennis racket shaped birch bark or willow hoop
the sinew straps are used to attach the shoe to the foot
children learned to ride a reindeer sleigh and use snowshoes at a very young age
the other koryak were skilled seafarers hunting whales and other marine mammals
koryaks believe in a supreme being whom they call by various names aj nen universe world ine itel n supervisor t olet nv l n master of the upper world t ol n one on high etc
he is considered to reside in heaven with his family and when he wishes to punish mankind for immoral acts he falls asleep and thus leaves man vulnerable to unsuccessful hunting and other ills
koryak mythology centers on the supernatural shaman quikil big raven who was created by the supreme being as the first man and protector of the koryak
big raven myths are also found in southeast alaska in the tlingit culture and among the haida tsimshian and other natives of the pacific northwest coast amerindians
koryak lands are mountains and volcanic covered in mostly arctic tundra
coniferous trees lie near the southern regions along the coast of the shelekhova bay of the sea of okhotsk
the northern regions inland are much colder where only various shrubs grow but these are enough to sustain reindeer migration
the mean temperature in winter is c f while the short summers are c f
the area they covered before russian colonization was km mi roughly corresponding to the koryak okrug of which the administrative centre is palana
today the koryak are the largest minority group with people
the krai s population is now majority ethnic russian descendants of the cossack colonizers
