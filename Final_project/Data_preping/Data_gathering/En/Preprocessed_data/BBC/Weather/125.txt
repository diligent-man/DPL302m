a new tropical storm south of hawaii will move along a similar track as hurricane dora the storm that enhanced ferocious winds that drove the maui wildfires one of which became the deadliest us wildfire in more than a century
tropical storm greg should pass hundreds of miles south of hawaii just like dora but its affect on the weather and fire conditions there is expected to be much less severe
dora was an intense category hurricane as it passed about miles south of hawaii s big island early last week
at the same time a strong area of high pressure was located north of the state
the opposing systems created a strong pressure gradient that enhanced high winds as air funneled between them
wind gusts last week reached speeds of up to mph on maui and mph on the big island according to data from the national weather service
even stronger wind gusts likely occurred and were not picked up by limited reporting stations especially on the west side of maui where winds would have become more intense as they descended nearby mountains
the atmospheric setup as greg passes south of hawaii tuesday through thursday is unlikely to be as intense as what helped to enhance last week s devastating winds

greg will be weaker than dora as it passes south of hawaii as a tropical storm
high pressure to the north of the island chain is also not forecast to be as strong as last week
this means the pressure gradient and winds will be weaker than last week s event and more comparable to hawaii s typically breezy trade winds
but hawaii is not in the clear
at least three wildfires are burning across portions of maui and one is still active on the big island as of sunday night including maui s deadly lahaina fire which was contained
wind speeds will increase across hawaii from tuesday through thursday with gusts of to mph expected
winds of this magnitude can flare up ongoing fires and drive the spread of any new ignitions
dry conditions are still in place across portions of hawaii with severe drought reported in parts of southern and western maui so fire ignition and spread could happen quickly if given a spark with gusty winds already in place
