The Atlantic hurricane season typically reaches its peak this week but record-warm ocean temperatures are fueling a hyperactive season that experts say shows no signs of slowing
The average hurricane season starts June and runs through November but its statistical peak is on September
So far this year hurricane activity has been above average in every respect according to Phil Klotzbach a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University
It’s been a pretty busy season Klotzbach told CNN
It’s not a slam dunk but it’s looking like the season is going to be classified as above-normal
Some fast facts on hurricanes so far
Before it started forecasters predicted an average season but warned of more uncertainty than usual because of a climatic battle between a burgeoning El Niño and warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures
El Niños tend to produce more wind shear upper-level winds that can rip storms apart but warm water can fuel their growth
Then as the season started ocean warmth skyrocketed to record levels and forecasters warned of explosive tropical development and a more active season something that has come to fruition
We saw how hot the Atlantic was and said ‘Alright we gotta go for it’ said Klotzbach whose research group creates seasonal hurricane forecasts
Thankfully we have a strong El Niño Klotzbach said because if there was no El Niño the season would probably be tracking of normal instead of of normal
But Klotzbach said this El Niño which by all measures is considered strong isn’t affecting the western Atlantic like it normally would
Because the Atlantic is so warm you’re not getting as much shear as you would normally get Klotzbach told CNN
If you compare it to or other big years the Atlantic had where it was really warm we’re in a whole different ballgame this year
The extreme ocean heat and low wind shear are having some major effects on the season Klotzbach said
More storms are able to form than would otherwise be possible in a typical El Niño year
Even the storms that have been weakened by moderate shear like hurricanes Franklin and Lee were able to stay alive and restrengthen once they found more favorable conditions
If we leave a storm out there long enough eventually it’s going to find somewhere where the shear isn’t that strong and it can strengthen Klotzbach said
More frequent rapid intensification and more major hurricanes are also byproducts of this season’s ripe conditions
Idalia Franklin and Lee all rapidly intensified in water running well above normal
Lee adds to a growing trend of intense hurricanes powered by warmer oceans
Warm water is not the only thing you need but it does kind of load the dice toward these high-end rapid intensification events Klotzbach said
You look at the water Lee was tracking over it should have been at degrees Celsius instead they’re degrees Celsius it’s like rocket fuel
The season isn’t over yet of hurricane season activity happens from mid-August until mid-October and Klotzbach said the next two weeks still look like they could produce more storms
Beyond that point it’s anyone’s guess Klotzbach said but an Atlantic tinderbox has already proven full of surprises this season
At the end of the day we’ve learned even in a strong El Niño if you get the Atlantic warm enough it can hold its own Klotzbach said
