ever noticed hurricane hunter flight pattern shown meteorologist tv look like random odd shapes
flight pattern may look like box star serve specific purpose individual storm
hurricane hunter dont fly away storm like commercial airline do
two distinctive group hurricane hunter national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa u air force reserve usaf
organization fly mission tropical disturbance order record invaluable data used forecaster national hurricane center nhc
hurricane hunter two main type mission flown fixed invest
fixed mission designated system meet tropical cyclone qualification tropical depression tropical storm hurricanes
main objective mark center circulation monitor wind speed pressure change variable tricky satellite space measure full detail
fixed mission alpha common flight pattern used collect data tropical cyclone
alpha pattern standard profile fly fix mission one people familiar seeing u maj
jeremy dehart meteorologist aerial reconnaissance weather officer air force reserve rd weather reconnaissance squadron said
pattern consists two leg flown intercardinal direction complete look lot like greek alpha symbol including crossleg
cardinal direction standard point compass north south east west
intercardinal direction diagonal point northeast southeast southwest northwest
latest vdm rdwrs mission indicates hurricane larry longer ha defined eyewall central pressure rose mb passes
interestingly bigger stronger storm tend easier one fly in
normally fly stronger storm lot question storm center dehart said
flight rough course end day go fly storm center collect data send nhc
primary objective invest mission determine system meet definition tropical cyclone storm yet name real tropical structure characteristics
invest mission nhc often send estimated coordinate believe center circulation mission target starting point
however invest mission nature bit flexible flight pattern simply many unknown type storms
never know going find yet always thinking two three step ahead
really make u need think meteorology particular storm dehart said
closed low open wave maybe closed elongated battling shear several smaller swirl competing main circulation center weak storm invests tricky require lot thinking toes
air force hurricane hunter variety flight pattern choose invest mission x delta box name few
x pattern may resemble alpha pattern flown much lower altitude usually around feet
system becomes tropical storm hurricane hurricane hunter begin flying higher altitude ranging foot depending severity storm said jessica kendziorek public affair operation chief usaf rd wing
flight level delta box pattern usually ft absolute altitude
delta box pattern similar well fly around periphery forecast center seeing observe wind four quadrant storm would indicate closed circulation
find closed circulation confidently go find center well continue mission invest mode dehart said
noaa hurricane hunter also fly operational fixed invest mission though name may different usually research-oriented objectives
fly many unique flight pattern different type aircraft depending type mission assigned
hurricane hunter also fly third type mission air force rarely fly according dehart called synoptic missions
fixed mission noaa often fly figure rotated figure pattern butterfly pattern
butterfly figure pattern flown wp-d storm typically one used find center circulation said jonathan shannon public affair specialist noaa aircraft operation center office marine aviation operations
rotated figure pattern sound figure pattern turned side
goal every flight gather data around center storm pattern allow u efficiently fly storm various quadrant nick underwood noaa hurricane hunter said
data help predicting storm intensity well determining exactly center is
invest mission lawnmower square spiral pattern flown determine actual tropical characteristic associated area investigating
lawnmower pattern allows u map large area dont center aim paul flaherty science branch chief noaa aircraft operation center said
able map full circulation usually finding west wind well shift back figure based newly identified center position
square spiral pattern survey mission meant supply observation structure characteristic including information vortex center exists
unique third type mission flight pattern often used sample surrounding atmosphere help forecaster know direction storm likely go
closely-related star pattern also doe outer scan system also adding circumference loop near center circulation
recently noaa gulfstream iv flew star- pattern around hurricane larry investigate outflow pattern storm better determine storm wa headed
flight pattern youll typically see gulfstream iv circumnavigation storm well sampling atmosphere around ahead storm underwood said
regardless entity flying operational mission backbone national hurricane center tasked providing essential life-saving information storm
nhc take data us issue guidance advisory public people know whether elsa ida nicholas still tropical storm become hurricanes
