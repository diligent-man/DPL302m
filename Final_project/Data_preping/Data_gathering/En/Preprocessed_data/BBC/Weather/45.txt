Editor’s Note CNN’s continuing coverage of Hurricane Lee and Thursday’s forecast can be found here
Hurricane and tropical storm watches are now in effect for much of coastal New England as Hurricane Lee threatens to deliver a blow to parts of the region as well as Atlantic Canada later this week and into the weekend
Hurricane conditions heavy rainfall and coastal flooding are possible in portions of eastern Maine on Saturday the National Hurricane Center said
A hurricane watch has been issued for that area it said
Janet Mills on Wednesday urged residents to exercise caution and to take common-sense steps to ensure they have all they need to stay safe as the storm draws closer
The hurricane center also warned there is potential for life-threatening storm surge flooding in parts of southeastern Massachusetts including Cape Cod and Nantucket late Friday and Saturday
A storm surge watch has been issued there
A hurricane watch has been issued from Stonington Maine up to the US-Canada border as well as for parts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
A tropical storm watch has also been issued for a large part of coastal New England the center added
Lee’s winds could arrive as early as Friday evening for portions of New England and the Canadian Atlantic seaboard
The massive storm which remained a Category hurricane Wednesday evening was centered about miles south-southwest of Bermuda according to an pm
The storm had maximum sustained winds of mph
A tropical storm warning remains in effect for Bermuda ahead of Lee’s brush with the island Thursday
Bermuda is expected to feel tropical storm conditions by early Thursday the center said
On the forecast track the center of Lee will pass west of Bermuda Thursday and Thursday night and then approach the coast of New England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday it added
Lee will weaken but the storm’s impacts beyond its center will be significant because of its colossal size which has grown considerably since the weekend
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extend out up to miles
And that’s why a weaker storm isn’t less hazardous
A larger storm carries the potential to impact a more widespread area increasing the likelihood that Lee will affect New England
And the waterlogged region is particularly susceptible to damage from strong winds and additional rainfall
It’s dramatic and I think it’s intimidating for anybody any coastal areas that might be affected by the storm Lt
Josh Rannenberg who is flying through Hurricane Lee told Erin Burnett Wednesday evening
Normally when a major hurricane that I’ve seen makes landfall a lot of the … severe damage can be relatively localized
When a storm spreads out like this it can be intimidating in the sense that the damage is going to be much more widespread
Regardless of its exact track the storm’s impacts are expected to be widespread in New England even if it doesn’t make landfall
Due to Lee’s large size hazards will extend well away from the center and there will be little to no significance on exactly where the center reaches the coast the hurricane center has said
Exceptionally warm Atlantic has been 'rocket fuel' for a hyperactive hurricane season
The soil across much of New England is already soaked
Rainfall in parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire is more than above normal values over the past two weeks according to weather service data
Destructive flooding already occurred in parts of Massachusetts earlier this week
More rainfall this week ahead of Lee will prime the environment for flash flooding so even moderate amounts of rain from Lee could be dangerous
The combination of tropical storm-force wind gusts and saturated soil will also bring down trees more easily especially since trees across New England are still in full leaf
This raises the risk of a higher number of power outages across the region
Meanwhile dangerous surf is affecting the southeastern US coast from Florida through the Carolinas
The risk of rip currents now spans the East Coast from Florida to coastal Massachusetts
