dora a powerful category hurricane with sustained winds of mph was about miles southwest of honolulu wednesday the national hurricane center said
no coastal watches or warnings were in effect
the state likely experienced its most intense winds tuesday seeing wind gusts reaching up to mph said meteorologist ian morrison with the national weather service office in honolulu
but those effects are quickly dwindling
wind speeds lowered wednesday and are expected to further decrease thursday and friday according to morrison
the worst of the winds are certainly behind them as the wind gusts will decrease into the to mph range on thursday cnn meteorologist taylor ward said
still breezy but much better than the to mph gusts that were observed tuesday night into early wednesday morning
dropping winds doesn t mean the fires will go away morrison warned but added the drop will likely help firefighters working to contain the blazes
little rain is expected on the big island and maui this week and it will be limited to the eastern side of the island ward said
