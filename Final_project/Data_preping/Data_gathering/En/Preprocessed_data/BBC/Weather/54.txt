cnn s continuing coverage of hurricane lee and monday s forecast can be found here
hurricane lee has strengthened back into a category hurricane with maximum sustained winds of mph satellite pictures and data from a hurricane hunter plane indicated sunday
the powerful storm which has fluctuated in intensity throughout its time over the open atlantic is expected to become a very dangerous category by late sunday or early monday morning according to the national hurricane center
dangerous surf and rip currents have begun to reach portions of the southeast united states east coast and are forecast to worsen and spread northward along much of the us east coast during the next couple of days the national hurricane center said in an update sunday
lee is forecast to slow down considerably as it moves well north of puerto rico the british and us virgin islands and the northern leeward islands but it will have an impact there and on other caribbean islands
it remains too early to determine its long term track for later this week and how significant the impacts could be for northeastern us states bermuda and atlantic canada
by midweek lee will make a turn to the north eventually moving between bermuda and the us east coast late this week
the east coast is bracing for the same kind of large swells and rip currents that the caribbean is facing now
swells generated by lee are affecting portions of the lesser antilles the national hurricane center warned friday night
the british and us virgin islands puerto rico hispaniola the turks and caicos islands the bahamas and bermuda also face swells this weekend that can bring life threatening surf and rip conditions
waves breaking at to feet were forecast for sunday according to the national weather service office in san juan puerto rico
larger waves were expected this week along east and north facing beaches
beach erosion and coastal flooding is possible the office posted on social media
lee which was a category storm thursday intensified with exceptional speed into category status as it moved west across the atlantic more than doubling its wind speeds to mph in just a day
lee which was a category storm thursday intensified with exceptional speed into category status as it moved west across the atlantic more than doubling its wind speeds to mph in just a day
vertical wind shear and an eyewall replacement cycle a process that occurs with the majority of long lived major hurricanes has since led to the weakening of the storm the hurricane center said
hurricane lee strengthened back into a category hurricane sunday afternoon over the open atlantic and it s starting to send dangerous rip currents to parts of the southeast us coast even as the storm s longer term path and effects are uncertain forecasters said
lee with maximum sustained winds of mph was centered sunday night over the ocean about miles north of the caribbean s northern leeward islands and headed northwest the national hurricane center said in an p m

the powerful storm which has fluctuated in intensity throughout its time over the atlantic could become a category by monday morning before fluctuating again later in the week forecasters said
it remains too early to determine lee s long term track for later this week and how significant the impacts could be for northeastern us states bermuda and atlantic canada
but the storm already was generating swells that were affecting many of the far eastern caribbean islands as well as the british and us virgin islands puerto rico hispanola the turks and caicos the bahamas and bermuda
those swells could cause life threatening surf and rip currents the hurricane center said sunday

the storm grew larger though not stronger sunday evening
hurricane force winds extended up to miles from center by p m
et the hurricane center said up from miles six hours earlier
by midweek lee is expected to make a turn to the north likely moving between bermuda and the us east coast late this week
the east coast is bracing for the same kind of large swells and rip currents that the caribbean is facing now

lee which was a category storm thursday intensified with exceptional speed into category status as it moved west across the atlantic more than doubling its wind speeds to mph in just a day
vertical wind shear and an eyewall replacement cycle a process that occurs with the majority of long lived major hurricanes then led to the weakening of the storm the hurricane center said
computer model trends for lee have shown the hurricane taking a turn to the north this week
but exactly when that turn occurs and how far west lee will manage to track by then will play a huge role in how close it gets to the us
several steering factors at the surface and upper levels of the atmosphere will determine how close lee will get to the east coast
an area of high pressure over the atlantic known as the bermuda high will have a major influence on how quickly lee turns
a strong bermuda high would keep lee on its current west northwestward track and slow it down a bit
as the high pressure weakens this week it will allow lee to start moving northward
once that turn to the north occurs the position of the jet stream strong upper level winds that can change the direction of a hurricane s path will influence how closely lee is steered to the us
lee could make a quick turn to the north early this week if high pressure weakens significantly
if the jet stream sets up along the east coast it will function as a barrier that prevents lee from approaching the coast
this scenario would keep lee farther away from the us coast but could bring the storm closer to bermuda
lee could make a slower turn to the north because the high pressure remains robust and the jet stream sets up farther inland over the eastern us
this scenario would leave portions of the east coast mainly north of the carolinas vulnerable to a much closer approach from lee
