phoenix is supposed to be hot but the severity of the upcoming heat wave will bring a level of heat that will test even heat hardy places and do so for longer durations than have ever been observed before
the heat is hitting south texas south florida and the southwest us the hardest now and through the workweek but by the weekend the hottest temperatures will arrive in the southwest making brutally hot cities like phoenix even hotter
the latest heat wave is really an extension of a continuous heat wave which has never really stopped and has been affecting the south since mid june
phoenix could break the record for consecutive days above degrees as a result
the city has been above degrees for consecutive days and could break the record of days next tuesday
global heat in uncharted territory as scientists warn could be the hottest year on record
yes it s summer
yes these places are supposed to get hot
but not this hot and for this long
the duration of the current heat wave has meteorologists and climate scientists concerned
earth is screaming at us right now and people need to listen chief meteorologist and director of climate matters bernadette woods placky told me
it should be a wake up call or an urgency to people that this is just not normal
placky said we are pushing our planet to the brink with so many record breaking days and highs higher than we ve ever seen before and that we are entering uncharted territory globally
it puts us in a whole new climate zone placky explained
it pushes our heat even higher and extends it for longer
and that plays out in a lot of different ways that dramatically affects human health
more than million people are under heat alerts from california to florida on monday
heat advisories include places like miami in florida and houston and san antonio in texas where heat indices will peak this afternoon at around degrees
roughly high temperature records could be broken over the next five days and nearly record high minimums could also break records
while temperatures across the south should start to cool by a few degrees over the weekend the heat will continue to worsen across the southwest with readings potentially nearing record territory for the coming weekend the national weather service office in phoenix said
excessive heat warnings are in place for las vegas and phoenix where the highs this week will be at or above degrees and will stay hot long term
forty high temperature records and more than record high minimum temperatures could fall over the weekend across the us
temperatures around phoenix will struggle to drop below degrees some nights which can be deadly for those without air conditioning
cooler temperatures overnight help to cool our bodies and recover from the heat
with temperatures staying hot overnight heat stress and heat exhaustion will set in much faster
