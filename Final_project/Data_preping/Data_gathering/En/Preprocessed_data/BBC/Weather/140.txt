common weather phenomenon wildfire create include pyrocumulus cloud fire tornado smoke cloud cause significant cooling
latin pyro mean fire cumulus mean pile heap
form heat source due intense upward vertical motion air cooling condensing move higher sky
fire burn hot enough create cloud produce lighting rain called pyrocumulonimbus
pyrocumulonimbus cloud look much darker typical cloud large amount smoke ash
sometimes lightning strike generated even ignite additional fires
fire whirl occur superheated air near surface large fire zone rise rapidly air mass also spin much like dust devil whirlwind
instead dust rapidly rising air wildfire accelerate tightly spinning column air composed fire
thunderstorm formed pyrocumulonimbus cloud spawn large fire whirl sometimes called firenadoes enough instability atmosphere
wildfire spawned fire vortex wind high mph temperature degree fahrenheit
however typical spin-ups wildfire weaker spin normally meet tornado qualifications
cloud smoke wildfire produce may also serve cool environment cases
cloud thick enough sunlight struggle get leaving surface much cooler would warmed sun
cloud sometimes produce rain help put fire though rain often evaporates reaching ground hot dry environment
