the atlantic hurricane season is headed into uncharted territory with water temperatures in the atlantic ocean and the gulf of mexico warmer than they have ever been on record
seasonal forecasters are warning it means you need to prepare for a more uncertain forecast for the rest of the season with the potential for more storms and stronger ones
warm ocean water is one of the key ingredients for fueling hurricanes and it s been in abundance so far this year
scientists first sounded the alarm in april and the ocean warmth has only escalated since
water in the gulf of mexico and the atlantic has been record warm especially for this early in the year
it includes off the coast of florida where water temperatures in the florida keys were close to degrees in some spots last week
it is important because warm ocean water breeds stronger bigger and wetter storms
it gives hurricanes the energy they need to grow and sometimes rapidly intensify something hurricane forecasters told cnn we could see more of this season
warm oceans can also lead to more evaporation and wring out more rainfall falling from any storms
but hurricane season predictions involve more than just warm water
it s just one factor in the birth and survival of tropical cyclones and it is creating more uncertainty than usual in what could happen the rest of the hurricane season
uncertainty uncertainty uncertainty that s really the story going forward with this season dr
phil klotzbach a research scientist in the department of atmospheric science at colorado state university told me
klotzbach and the team at csu are some of the pioneers of long term hurricane season outlooks and just increased the number of expected hurricanes and major hurricanes in their prediction for this season due to the warmer water in the atlantic
what makes this year even more uncertain is we are now under the influence of el ni o which typically suppresses activity in the atlantic with increased wind shear the changing of wind direction and speed with height which can blow budding storms to pieces and shred existing storms to death
klotzbach said the confluence of these record warm temperatures at the same time as a moderate to strong el ni o hasn t been observed historically
the million dollar question right now is which will win out warm ocean temperatures or el ni o
early season predictions called for a near average season but klotzbach and team seem to think the warm water will win out and are now calling for an above normal atlantic hurricane season
what is el ni o
warm water won in june
according to klotzbach june had the lowest wind shear in the southern atlantic basin since
arlene bret and cindy formed as a result
wind shear and dry air from saharan dust picked up in the month of july suppressing hurricane activity for the most part but august through october could be different
most climate models are forecasting slightly to somewhat below normal shear in august september and even into october klotzbach said
if that were the case we would likely have an extremely busy season given how warm the atlantic is
as of now there s not much noteworthy on the horizon as far as tropical development goes
subtropical storm don is meandering around the north central atlantic but poses no threat to land
forecast models aren t picking up any development this week
forecasts for next week are hinting at some tropical development but it s far too early to have confidence in how if or when this could materialize
what we do know is hurricane season typically starts ramping up as we head into august
the first hurricane usually forms in early to mid august
the eight week span from mid august through mid october is when ocean temperatures are nearing their highest levels in the atlantic wind shear lessens considerably and when nearly of all hurricane activity in the atlantic happens
the bottom line is this season is already unprecedented given the hot ocean temperatures so forecasting the season in the uncharted territory we ve entered is a challenge
we ve got a lot of hurricane season left to go which means you should prepare for the worst and hope for the best
