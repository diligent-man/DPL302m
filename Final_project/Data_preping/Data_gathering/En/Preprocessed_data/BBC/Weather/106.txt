areas along the south texas coast are under tropical storm alerts for a system currently a tropical depression that could start lashing the area with wind rain and coastal flooding as soon as tuesday morning
tropical depression formed in the gulf of mexico late monday afternoon and is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm before its heavy rain and gusty winds spread into southern texas and northern mexico the national hurricane center said
the storm s center is expected to move inland over south texas by midday tuesday hurricane center said
a tropical storm warning is in effect for portions of south texas south of port o connor and a tropical storm watch has been issued from port o connor northward to sargent
if it becomes a tropical storm it could be named harold depending on whether another area in the atlantic ocean closer to africa develops into a tropical storm first

ct monday located about miles east southeast of port mansfield texas and moving west northwest through the gulf of mexico
rough seas beach erosion heavy rain gusty winds and tornadoes will be possible from early tuesday through tuesday night
conditions in the gulf of mexico are ripe for tropical development
sea surface temperatures in the gulf of mexico are warmer than they ve ever been on record according to analysis of noaa data by hurricane expert michael lowry
global ocean temperatures soared to the highest level on record this week
the water temperatures in the upper s give any budding tropical system the ability to thrive
there is also very low wind shear right now in the gulf
wind shear is what tears apart tropical systems so without it the storm could further develop and better organize
the system will bring heavy rainfall to the texas coast as well as inland locations regardless of its final strength
this could help a worsening drought affecting more than of the state but at the risk of flash flooding
the latest track has the system making landfall well south of corpus christi along the south central texas coast
south texas including corpus christi could generally see up to inches of rain from tuesday to wednesday with as many as inches of rain for some isolated locations according to the hurricane center which is urging residents to be prepared for flash flooding
in addition to heavy rainfall the storm will provide relief from exceptional summer heat in south texas
in mexico generally to inches of rain are possible in the states of nuevo leon and coahuila on tuesday and wednesday with as many as inches possible in isolated locations the hurricane center said
while this tropical system will bring some beneficial rain to parts of the drought stricken state some of the worst drought conditions areas of extreme and exceptional drought in central texas might miss out on the bulk of the rain
this storm is the latest sign of the atlantic hurricane season exploding into action
it s almost as if a light switch was turned on in the atlantic basin three tropical systems formed in hours saturday into sunday and now the texas storm is expected to make it four
this is only the third time on record three tropical systems have formed within hours according to lowry
while the gulf system is the most imminent of the tropical threats two other tropical storms are lined up in the atlantic basin
tropical storm franklin poses the biggest threat and is set to impact hispaniola by mid week
the storm s center had sustained winds of mph as of p m
et monday located over the caribbean about miles south of santo domingo dominican republic
it is expected to make a hard turn to the north by tuesday morning and make landfall in hispaniola tuesday night or early wednesday
tropical storm warnings are in effect for the southern side of hispaniola while tropical storm watches cover the northern side
there are also tropical storm watches for turks and caicos
rainfall amounts of to inches with isolated higher amounts up to inches will be possible across portions of hispaniola
ocean heat is off the charts so where are the hurricanes forecasters warn a change is coming
the heavy rainfall may produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well as river rises and mudslides warned the hurricane center
across hispaniola significant and potentially life threatening flash flooding is possible tuesday into wednesday
the two other systems in the atlantic don t pose a risk to the us or the caribbean
gert is expected to fizzle out within the next hours and emily which is much further out in the atlantic has already fizzled out as well
the frenetic run of tropical activity is expected to continue
the eight week span from mid august through mid october is when ocean temperatures are nearing their highest levels in the atlantic wind shear lessens considerably and when nearly of all hurricane activity in the atlantic happens
of course it remains to be seen what will happen following this flurry of activity but given the nhc s tropical weather outlooks model projections and large scale conditions i expect the atlantic will be quite busy through at least early september said phil klotzbach research scientist in the department of atmospheric science at colorado state university
