tropical storm philippe is on track to deliver a dreary weekend to the northeast including a slug of tropical moisture which is raising the risk of flooding rainfall in an area that has been soaked repeatedly in recent weeks
the tropical storm has mph winds and is still hundreds of miles from the us
philippe is expected to transition into a post tropical storm by the time it makes landfall in maine or atlantic canada saturday night but this will have little effect on philippe s ability to unload heavy rainfall and spread gusty winds
philippe s projected track has echoes of hurricane lee in september when the much weakened post tropical system brought strong winds and rain to parts of the northeast and canada
for now portions of new england and eastern new york are most likely to experience heavy rain and potential flooding
a level of slight risk of excessive rainfall was issued for saturday in these areas by noaa s climate prediction center
but the bull s eye of heaviest rainfall could shift if low pressure moving across the eastern us pulls philippe closer to the northeast
this potential shift could move the risk closer to the mid atlantic an area where another deluge would be particularly worrisome
heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week but a widespread to inches of rain is possible north of new york city in new york and into new england
higher amounts closer up to inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up most likely in maine
heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week but a widespread to inches of rain is possible across new york and new england
higher amounts closer to to inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up likely in maine
fall foliage is nearing or at peak condition in parts of maine so the timing of philippe s drenching rainfall could disrupt leaf peeping plans this weekend
in addition to heavy rain gusty winds are possible across portions of new england and atlantic canada saturday night into sunday as philippe comes ashore
philippe has quite a distance to travel before approaching the us and canada but it will soon come in close contact with bermuda
the island s weather service issued a tropical storm warning wednesday evening as philippe closed in
bermuda is only miles across so landfalls are rare
only eleven systems have made landfall on the island since according to data from noaa
but philippe won t have to make landfall in order to unload strong wind gusts and heavy rain
tropical storm force wind gusts are likely across bermuda when philippe makes its closest pass on friday
rain arrived on thursday afternoon ahead of any wind
philippe is expected to be a tropical storm as it swipes the island so the risk of widespread damage is limited but power outages are possible
