hurricane idalia caused significant damage ripped florida big bend mph wind record-setting storm surge
storm evolution landfall lucky timing tide likely prevented even worse disaster
forecast national hurricane center called idalia rapidly intensify strengthen way landfall
hurricane wind increased mph pushing idalia mph category rate intensification exceptional rank top atlantic storm since according noaa research meteorologist john kaplan
wednesday morning storm mile minute landfall hurricane center announced idalias wind dropped mph wa undergoing eyewall replacement cycle
strong hurricane shed smaller eyewall ring intense wind surround hurricane calm eye favor larger one
process storm wind weaken complete storm larger start intensify even further
idalias landfall kept process completing preventing hurricane even larger intense forecast landfall
would six hour water think totally different hurricane would made landfall jamie rhome deputy director national hurricane center told cnn
even idalias incomplete eyewall cycle could massive effect people experienced rhome said
hurricane structure wa changing affected strongest wind set got worst surge result
small condensed eye could produce higher surge confined area rhome said
kind storm swath surge tiny could literally walk across said rhome
hurricane charley wa one example made landfall category hurricane produced foot surge small area
inside hurricane hunter flight idalia became category storm
case idalia wind field wa expanding eyewall replacement cycle mean could broadened scope surge expense peak intensity
structural change also change angle wind dramatic impact surge timing wind surge relative tide
tide another key factor severity surge especially cedar key florida
thing happened cedar key storm timing changed rhome said
luckily luckily came low tide probably whacked know four foot surge that
rhome said post-storm analysis done better understand exactly effect eyewall replacement cycle factor idalia
survey also done determine bad storm surge wa complicated fact tidal gauge area actually measure storm surge
cedar key hurricane idalia turned 'haven artists' flooded wreck
cnn analysis national hurricane center forecast showed wa nearly spot-on
five day landfall forecast wa within mile idalias center would eventually come ashore
early monday forecast wa already calling category landfall
rhome also said belief survey show wa widespread foot storm surge wa also forecast
everything accurately predicted idalia showed minutia something complicated hurricane make big difference people actually experience
rapid intensification eyewall replacement cycle specifically timing difficult thing forecast field meteorology
forecaster know likely rhome said next impossible know complete
societal expectation perfection forecast exceeds limit predictability society desire know precisely whats going happen doorstep five day prior rhome said
understand need science right would allow u provide that
