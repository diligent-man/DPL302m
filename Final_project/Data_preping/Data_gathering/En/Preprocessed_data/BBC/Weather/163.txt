It was the first EF tornado in central North Carolina during the month of July the weather service said The EF scale runs from to and rates tornadoes after they’ve hit by assessing damage to determine wind speed
More than a dozen people were treated for minor injuries in Nash County as a result of the storm a county spokesperson said
Three people were injured in neighboring Edgecombe County two with life threatening injuries when the storm passed through the sheriff’s office said
The North Carolina Department of Insurance NCDOI said its commissioner Mike Causey will tour storm damage on Thursday and offer assistance to storm victims in Nash County in the aftermath of the tornado
Some structures in the tornado’s path were flattened Pfizer’s Rocky Mount facility suffered severe damage video from helicopters showed the roof crumpled like paper and building debris scattered into the surrounding parking lot There were no reports of injuries at the plant according to a statement from the company
We are assessing the situation to determine the impact on production Our thoughts are with our colleagues our patients and the community as we rebuild from this weather incident the statement said
That plant is one of the largest facilities manufacturing sterile injectable drugs in the world with more than million square feet of manufacturing space on acres in the eastern part of the state Pfizer says
The site is responsible for supplying more than a quarter of sterile injectable medicines used in US hospitals And supply chain experts feared the damage could exacerbate the country’s already historic level of drug shortages with more than medicines in short supply as of the end of June according to a database from the University of Utah Drug Information Service
Products made at the plant include anesthesia pain blockers known as analgesics anti infectives neuromuscular blockers and others according to a Pfizer fact sheet
The drug giant acquired the plant in its acquisition of Hospira In quality issues at the plant led to shortages of anesthesia and other products
We don’t know yet if Pfizer will be able to transfer any of their manufacturing to some of their newer plants that they have built or if things will stop and we’ll have severe shortages and just wait for the plant to be rebuilt Erin Fox a drug shortages expert at University of Utah Health told CNN in an email
