A dire and potentially catastrophic situation is unfolding across parts of New England and New York where continuous rounds of heavy rain parked over the region are triggering flash flooding of epic proportions
This system has already proven impressive and deadly
Nearly inches of rain fell in just six hours in Orange County New York on Sunday at the US Military Academy at West Point
That was a -in--year rainfall event for the location one that is so intense it usually only occurs once every years
The surge of floodwaters there swept away and killed a woman Sunday night and forced dozens of high water rescues
More devastating scenes were already unfolding Monday morning in Vermont where the Weather Prediction Center issued a rare Level out of high risk of excessive rainfall
It’s the first time a high risk has been issued for the area according to the WPC
It’s hard to overstate how big of a deal these high risks are
They are issued on fewer than of days per year on average but are responsible for of all flood-related damage and of all flood-related deaths research from the WPC shows
So seeing one is a sign that destructive and deadly flooding is likely
That’s exactly what the National Weather Service in Burlington Vermont warned of Monday calling for potentially catastrophic widespread flash flooding … with possible impacts not seen since Hurricane Irene
Irene damaged or destroyed homes and businesses nearly roads and bridges with its catastrophic rainfall over the state in but that’s exactly the kind of destruction high risk days warn of
Extreme floods are happening way more often than federal data would suggest analysis shows
While Vermont is where the greatest risk of flooding exists all of New England is at risk of excessive rainfall
Rainfall rates as high as inches per hour are forecast and could cause rainfall totals as high as inches through Monday in locations where storms begin to train meaning they roll over the same location for long periods of time
A more widespread amount of up to inches of rain will be common throughout New England
All of the rain must go somewhere but the ground is already wet and the hilly mountainous terrain has less surface area for rain to soak into the soil
The steep inclines could send it rushing down into streams and rivers which can rise quickly with little warning and then overwhelm any flood protection
The worst of the rain should stop by Tuesday but more is possible across some of these same parts of New England later in the week so this flood situation is something this region will be dealing with for days to come
