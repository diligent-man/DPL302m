massachusetts cities devastated by floodwater could face new perils as more rain is on the way and officials wonder whether a very sensitive dam in will hold up
maura healey has declared a state of emergency across massachusetts on tuesday due to catastrophic flooding that began monday and inflicted damage to homes businesses and infrastructure including bridges dams and railways
different types of flash flooding and what causes it
about a dozen homes in the town of north attleborough were completely under water tuesday said chris coleman the town s fire and emergency management chief
and about homes were damaged in and around north attleborough after a storm monday quickly dumped about inches of rain on ground already saturated from a weekend storm officials said
it was really scary the amount of water that fell in just a short amount of time and the incredible devastation that it caused the governor said
no civilian injuries have been reported from the north attleborough flooding but a firefighter was injured overnight and was in stable condition coleman said tuesday
she also said the massive flooding that hit various regions of massachusetts severely impacted two dams damaged railroad tracks and forced a number of seniors to be evacuated by boats in the middle of the night
one of those dams has been shored up already and the other will be shored up by the end of the day said healey who toured the damage on tuesday
leominster was another city in massachusetts to face a torrential downpour this week
the city got pummeled by roughly inches of rain in just six to seven hours mayor dean mazzarella said tuesday
some basements in leominster probably have feet of water inside of them mazzarella said
we have several homes where the water washed out you can see the foundation of the home
thousands of americans are leaving homes in flood risk areas
but where are they moving to
while no serious injuries have been reported the mayor said we had to evacuate people last night with hovercrafts and boats to get people out to safety
leominster was quickly inundated not just by torrential downpours but also from water gushing downhill
leominster is about square miles
we have hills and obviously from those hills comes the water the mayor said
and with inches of rain it just adds to the water going downhill
the massachusetts emergency management agency has urged some residents to evacuate due to a potential issue at the barrett park pond dam mema said on x formerly known as twitter
this particular dam is one that we re actually about to replace mazzarella said
it is very sensitive
it s water saturated
and we re worried about that downstream
so we ve put out a code red and notified everyone along that stream bank along that river base to evacuate
and it s not clear when children in leominster will be able to go back to school
our schools are closed tuesday the mayor said
we have a couple of schools that experienced severe damage and flooding
and the other schools are open for shelters
the deluge has also washed away roads and created a large sinkhole mazzarella said
that was the road it s gone the mayor said in a facebook video showing the massive sinkhole
mema staff have been on scene in leominster since last night supporting the local flood response coordinating requests for assistance including sandbags additional shelter staff traffic sign boards shelter equipment to support residents with disabilities

videos posted on social media showed vehicles submerged by dark floodwater covering a highway
other footage shows emergency vehicles trying to navigate a street overtaken by rapidly moving water as rain keeps falling
another video shows water filling a gaping sinkhole in the middle of a street lined with houses
the torrent was so intense that a packed foot by foot dumpster traveled down a local river and ended up in the middle of a riverwalk trail mazzarella said
officials have no idea where the dumpster came from
while the rain has largely subsided in leominster it s going to take a while for the rivers to reach their peak mazzarella said tuesday morning
treacherous flooding also overwhelmed the area around providence rhode island monday night where residents were under a flash flood warning
rescue crews there helped at least people who had become trapped in cars and buildings as the waters rose the mayor s office told cnn
no residents were reported injured
while the impacted regions get a reprieve from heavy rain tuesday but another round of storms could move through wednesday
most of the northeast including central massachusetts faces a slight risk of excessive rainfall late wednesday and early thursday according to the weather prediction center
and more rain could thrash massachusetts and eastern new england this weekend depending on the track of hurricane lee
the governor said local and state agencies are working to address damages in zones impacted by the storms and that her office is preparing an emergency declaration that will be issued later tuesday
