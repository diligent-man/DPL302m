tropical depression ten has formed near the yucatan peninsula in the western caribbean according to the national hurricane center and it could become a hurricane by tuesday afternoon that would make landfall in florida as early as wednesday
a tropical storm warning has been issued for the yucatan in mexico from tulum to rio lagartos including cozumel
a tropical storm watch has also been issued for the western tip of cuba in the provinces of pinar del rio and the isle of youth
the system is developing as what was tropical storm franklin has strengthened into a category hurricane in the atlantic
the depression is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm on sunday as it meanders in the yucatan channel
by monday the system will begin moving north entering the gulf of mexico
the storm is expected to further strengthen on monday and tuesday as the system crosses the gulf moving towards florida
the official track calls for the storm to become a hurricane by tuesday afternoon in the eastern gulf of mexico and make landfall along the western coast of the florida peninsula by wednesday
the forecast cone stretches from tampa bay to panama city and the nhc notes that that there is significant uncertainty in day intensity predictions and the public are urged to monitor changes to future forecasts
the next storm name on the atlantic s list is idalia pronounced ee dal ya
gulf coast officials are scrambling to prepare for two weather disasters to combine in deadly fashion
who should pay attention anyone living in mexico s yucatan peninsula cuba and the northern gulf and florida coast should monitor the forecast in the coming days
the direction and strength of the upper level steering winds around this system will dictate where it will move and how quickly
florida governor ron desantis issued an executive order saturday declaring a state of emergency for counties ahead of the potential inclement weather
the governor and the florida division of emergency management are taking timely precautions to ensure florida s communities infrastructure and resources are prepared including those communities that are still recovering following hurricane ian reads a news release announcing the executive order
when could it affect the us the depression is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm on sunday as it moves through the yucatan channel
by monday the system will likely enter the gulf of mexico and move towards florida
it could become a hurricane by tuesday afternoon and hit the western coast of the florida peninsula by wednesday
how strong could it get it s still too soon to tell how strong this system could get or how fast it could strengthen
but it will be tracking through the warmest waters in the entire atlantic basin a vast source of energy for a developing storm
exceptionally warm water can provide storms the fuel needed to strengthen and sometimes undergo rapid intensification
sea surface temperatures are record warm in the gulf of mexico and extremely high across the northwestern caribbean sea
water temperatures need to be around degrees fahrenheit to sustain tropical development and portions of the caribbean and gulf are well above that threshold
a hurdle to development warm water isn t the only factor at play
this tropical system would also need upper level winds to cooperate
high wind shear the wind s change in direction or speed with altitude can tear a developing storm apart
how much wind shear this potential system faces is a critical factor in its formation and final strength
one forecast model shows more wind shear limiting its development
another shows less wind shear allowing the system to develop
either way wind shear may decrease for a time early next week across the far northern caribbean and eastern gulf of mexico allowing any system that forms to hold together
meanwhile out in the central atlantic what was tropical storm franklin strengthened into a category hurricane with maximum sustained winds of miles per hour according to a saturday morning update from the national hurricane center
this was confirmed via aircraft reconnaissance by the noaa and air force hurricane hunters
hurricane franklin is currently located miles south of bermuda and is moving relatively slowly at miles per hour towards the north northwest
steady strengthening is forecast and franklin could become a major hurricane early next week said the center in its update
a major hurricane is defined as category or higher with winds above mph
swells generated by franklin are expected to begin affecting bermuda by sunday night the hurricane center said noting that these swells are also likely to cause life threatening surf and rip current conditions late this weekend into early next week along portions of the east coast of the united states
small variations in franklin s track through the weekend will determine exactly how close it gets to bermuda when it make its closest pass monday and monday night
franklin s winds and rainfall will extend beyond its center
tropical storm force wind gusts are possible across bermuda early next week as franklin makes its closest approach
a few showers and thunderstorms are also possible across bermuda as franklin passes
