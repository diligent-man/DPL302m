editor s note read our coverage of hurricane hilary for friday here
hurricane hilary is rapidly intensifying in the pacific ocean southwest of mexico on thursday and is on track to deliver potentially significant rain and flooding to parts of the southwest as a weaker system starting this weekend
hilary strengthened into a major category hurricane thursday evening with sustained winds of mph and even stronger gusts according to the national hurricane center
the storm will likely reach category hurricane strength on friday with winds of at least mph the center warned
the hurricane was about miles south of cabo san lucas mexico thursday evening
there remains a wide range of outcomes for the heaviest rain and strongest winds in the us as the storm moves north over the next couple of days along mexico s baja peninsula
small deviations in the hurricane s track could change the forecast for the most intense rain and wind
hilary s rainfall could arrive as early as saturday in parts of the southwest with the worst of its impacts set to arrive in california early monday
shifts in the forecast track will also affect which areas of northwestern mexico will face the worst of hilary s winds which will be strong enough to snap trees down power lines and cause significant damage to property closest to the storm s center
mudslides and flash flooding are possible from a general to inches of rain across mexico s baja peninsula from thursday to early monday with greater amounts possible in the higher terrain
hilary is expected to weaken significantly before it reaches southern california and parts of the southwest but there s an increasing chance of significant impacts to these areas in the form of heavy rain and flooding
southern california could receive some of hilary s heaviest rainfall
widespread rainfall amounts of to inches may fall there and in southern nevada from saturday through monday
the heaviest rainfall is expected mainly sunday and monday
locally higher amounts up to inches are possible in areas impacted by the heaviest deluges
rainfall amounts of to inches are possible for parts of arizona central california and northern nevada
multiple days of heavy rainfall will give the ground little opportunity to absorb moisture and can progressively worsen the flood threat
daniel swain a climate scientist at the university of california at los angeles said wednesday that multiple years worth of precipitation could potentially fall in some of california s driest areas
one of those places is death valley california the hottest place on earth
death valley typically receives about inches of rain across an entire year according to nws data
moisture from hilary could unleash enough rain to give death valley at least a year s worth of rainfall in a single day
rainfall this exceptional proved destructive in death valley last year
around people became stranded in death valley national park last august when inches of rain fell in hours and unleashed flash flooding that washed away roads and entombed cars in floodwater swept debris
despite the flooding danger the rainfall would help combat drought and recharge groundwater across parched portions of the southwest
drought conditions expanded in new mexico and remained steady in california and arizona this week the us drought monitor reported thursday
the seasonal monsoon that supplies the region with a large percentage of its yearly rainfall has been missing for much of the summer and cities like phoenix are still waiting for measurable rainfall
the combination of rainfall and increased cloud cover across the southwest is expected to bring a significant cooldown over the weekend
temperatures that have been in the upper s to s could drop by as much as degrees
phoenix may not reach a high temperature in the triple digits over the weekend for the first time since the middle of june
hilary is more likely to make landfall in mexico and cross into california
but if the storm makes landfall in california as a tropical storm it would be the first to do so in nearly years and only the third tropical storm or stronger to do so on record according to data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration
the most recent was an unnamed tropical storm in noaa records show
before that the san diego hurricane made landfall in october california s only hurricane landfall on record research shows
s nora was the last and only other tropical storm to maintain its status after crossing into california
the current forecast also calls for hilary to maintain its tropical status as it heads into nevada something that has never happened on record
