the heat dome is so formidable the national weather service in phoenix called it one of the strongest high pressure systems this region has ever seen around heat records could fall today through the weekend as it intensifies piling onto the more than high temperature records broken in the us since june
more than million people are under heat alerts after the heat dome expanded into places like california which is now experiencing its first extreme heat wave of the year
it has already been dangerously hot for weeks in texas florida and arizona where phoenix is in the middle of a likely record breaking streak of consecutive degree days forcing many businesses and parks to close or readjust their hours
the low temperature in phoenix might not drop below degrees for eight consecutive days another record
the heat will be so intense forecasters suggested residents of las vegas avoid the outdoors between a m
and p m with the city forecast to challenge its all time high temperature of degrees on sunday
it won t get much cooler at night with low temperatures nearing degrees a particularly dangerous side effect of the climate crisis

even the hottest place on earth california s death valley could reach rare highs with degrees possible sunday forecasters at the national weather service told cnn

this kind of extreme heat is one of the hallmarks of human caused climate change the symptoms of which are tallying up this year into a global record box score of sorts unprecedented ocean heat off the coast of florida and in the north atlantic record heat in beijing in what could be one of the hottest summers in china record energy demand and heat in texas and an ongoing cerberus heat wave threatening to topple european temperature records
it all adds up to what could be the hottest year on record
skyrocketing temperatures across the western us have forced some businesses and parks to close or change their hours such as the sacramento zoo which shortened its hours due to the heat closing early friday saturday and sunday at p m
pt as temperatures are forecast to reach degrees fahrenheit this weekend

the records also add up into something more serious for human health doctors say
make no mistake about it this heat is deadly and being in it for long periods of time is deadly dr
matthew levy of the johns hopkins university school of medicine told cnn
the extreme temperatures could trigger heat illness in as little as to minutes for people doing anything strenuous outdoors because heat acts as a perfect storm which overloads the body until it eventually short circuits and then shuts down levy said
the time frame would be even shorter for those most vulnerable to heat like the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions
heat illness is a serious concern this weekend for the millions of residents in major metro areas like phoenix and las vegas
the planet is getting hotter fast
this is what happens to your body in extreme heat
people across the southwest and california s central valley are under a rare extreme level of heat risk on saturday sunday and monday according to the weather service
the extreme heatrisk is the highest possible risk level for heat akin to a high risk for tornadoes and is meant to warn of significant heat impacts requiring preparation
these areas should prepare for spikes in heat related er visits potential power outages from demand and temperatures high enough to turn deadly especially for outdoor workers and those without reliable cooling
levy said workers can stay safe by taking frequent hydration breaks wearing clothing able to reflect the sun and having a buddy system so no one is left in the heat alone when illness strikes
for those who don t have reliable cooling he recommends finding a cooling center and having a plan to get there before the need arises
before the latest wave heat has already killed at least people in phoenix s maricopa county this year and killed people last year
the city has opened respite centers to help provide relief and the state has asked residents to keep their vehicles stocked with water
the heat won t go away after this weekend even if temperatures peak longer term temperature outlooks from the climate prediction center point to above normal temperatures across southern california the southwest south and florida through next week
