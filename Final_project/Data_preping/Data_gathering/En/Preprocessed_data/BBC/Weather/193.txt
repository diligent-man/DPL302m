perfect storm unfolding summer one climate scientist told cnn atmospheric ingredient combine create deadly flooding northeast u record-breaking heat southwest u around world

mann said el nio adding extra heat extra fuel fire el nio warm phenomenon pacific ocean combining climate crisis get new record level heat planetary scale
mann said without climate crisis caused burning fossil fuel simply wouldnt seeing extreme events
steady warming combined el nio extreme weather event related changing jet stream condition come together perfect storm consequence translates truly devastating deadly weather extreme dealing right now
