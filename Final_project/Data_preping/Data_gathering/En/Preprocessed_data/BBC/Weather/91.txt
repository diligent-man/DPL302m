a hurricane watch has been issued for portions of florida s gulf coast as the state braces for tropical storm idalia which is expected to strengthen to a hurricane and make landfall this week
the hurricane watch stretches from englewood to indian pass including tampa bay according to the national hurricane center s sunday afternoon update
in addition to the hurricane watch a tropical storm watch has been issued for the gulf coast of florida from englewood to chokoloskee and the dry tortugas
the storm is currently located about miles east of cozumel mexico moving at around mph with maximum sustained winds of mph the hurricane center said
forecasters predict idalia will slowly traverse the yucat n channel over the next to hours bringing tropical storm conditions to the far eastern portions of yucat n mexico and the western tip of cuba through monday
idalia is expected to make landfall on wednesday morning near the big bend of florida as a category hurricane
strengthening is forecast and idalia is expected to become a hurricane over the southeastern gulf of mexico by early tuesday reads the national hurricane center s update
additional strengthening is likely while idalia approaches the northeastern gulf coast
here s why hurricane hunters fly their planes in weird patterns into storms
hurricane hunters are probing idalia for data as the system intensifies
there is a notable risk of rapid intensification as the storm moves through the extremely warm waters in the gulf of mexico the hurricane center noted in an earlier update
rapid intensification occurs when the maximum sustained winds of a storm increase by mph or more in a hour period
idalia is forecast to drop to inches of rain on western cuba florida s west coast the panhandle and southern georgia with isolated totals of inches the hurricane center said
heavy rainfall may also arrive in parts of the carolinas by wednesday and into thursday
the heavy rain may lead to flash flooding the center warned particularly in western cuba the west coast of florida the florida panhandle and parts of the southeast us
life threatening storm surge heavy rainfall and hurricane force winds are expected in florida as early as tuesday
the bulk of the storm is forecast to move over parts of the southeast on wednesday
florida gov
ron desantis urged floridians to just heed the warnings of your local officials as the state prepares for idalia s arrival
our emergency operations center here in tallahassee will go to a level hour around the clock starting at a m
et monday desantis said
in preparation national guardsmen have been mobilized and they have access to high water vehicles and aircraft for rescue and recovery efforts desantis said
the florida highway patrol also has troopers ready to deploy
according to the governor power companies will start staging personnel on monday
schools in hernando county north of tampa will be closed monday through wednesday and voluntary evacuations have been issued for parts of the county according to a facebook post
residents are advised to seek safe shelter with family or friends that reside in a safe structure
if this is not a possibility a public shelter will open at pm on monday said the county in the post
president joe biden has been briefed on the storm and will continue to receive regular updates as the system heads toward the united states a white house official told cnn
gulf coast officials are scrambling to prepare for two weather disasters to combine in deadly fashion
who should pay attention anyone living in mexico s yucat n peninsula cuba and the northern gulf and florida coast should monitor the forecast in the coming days
the direction and strength of the upper level steering winds around this system will dictate where it will move and how quickly
as of sunday afternoon a tropical storm warning is in effect for yucat n peninsula from tulum to r o lagartos and pinar del r o in cuba a storm surge watch is in effect for chokoloskee to indian pass florida a hurricane watch is in effect for englewood to indian pass florida and a tropical storm watch is in effect for isle of youth in cuba south of englewood to chokoloskee florida and dry tortugas florida
desantis issued an executive order saturday declaring a state of emergency for counties ahead of the potential inclement weather
the governor and the florida division of emergency management are taking timely precautions to ensure florida s communities infrastructure and resources are prepared including those communities that are still recovering following hurricane ian reads a news release announcing the executive order
when could it affect the us by monday the system will likely enter the gulf of mexico and move toward florida
it could become a hurricane by tuesday afternoon and hit the western coast of the florida peninsula by wednesday
how strong could it get it s still too soon to tell how strong this system could get or how fast it could strengthen
but it will be tracking through the warmest waters in the entire atlantic basin a vast source of energy for a developing storm
exceptionally warm water can provide storms the fuel needed to strengthen and sometimes undergo rapid intensification
sea surface temperatures are record warm in the gulf of mexico and extremely high across the northwestern caribbean sea
water temperatures need to be around degrees fahrenheit to sustain tropical development and portions of the caribbean and gulf are well above the threshold
a hurdle to development warm water isn t the only factor at play
the tropical system would also need upper level winds to cooperate
high wind shear the wind s change in direction or speed with altitude can tear a developing storm apart
how much wind shear this potential system faces is a critical factor in its formation and final strength
one forecast model shows more wind shear limiting its development
another shows less wind shear allowing the system to develop
either way wind shear may decrease for a time early next week across the far northern caribbean and eastern gulf of mexico allowing any system that forms to hold together
meanwhile out in the central atlantic what was tropical storm franklin strengthened into a category hurricane with maximum sustained winds of miles per hour according to a sunday update from the national hurricane center
this was confirmed via aircraft reconnaissance by the noaa and air force hurricane hunters
hurricane franklin is currently located miles south of bermuda and is moving relatively slowly at miles per hour toward the north northwest
steady strengthening is forecast and franklin could become a major hurricane early next week said the center in its update
a major hurricane is defined as category or higher with winds above mph
swells generated by franklin are expected to begin affecting bermuda by sunday night the hurricane center said noting these swells are also likely to cause life threatening surf and rip current conditions late this weekend into early next week along portions of the east coast of the united states
small variations in franklin s track through the weekend will determine exactly how close it gets to bermuda when it makes its closest pass monday and monday night
franklin s winds and rainfall will extend beyond its center
tropical storm force wind gusts are possible across bermuda early next week as franklin makes its closest approach
a few showers and thunderstorms are also possible across bermuda as franklin passes
