national weather service say almost half death tropical cyclone come storm surge
many people focus wind speed storm danger often come water flowing ocean
storm surge rise water level caused strong storm wind pushing water on-shore said cnn meteorologist brandon miller
storm surge account nearly half hurricane-related fatality according national oceanic atmospheric administration
water pile along coast river stream typically drain ocean become clogged farther upstream forcing water level rise
depending much water wa pushed ashore area watershed may hang around causing damage communities
due climate change storm surge ha become even greater threat recent years
higher baseline ocean level allows storm surge reach even higher increasing destructive capability miller said
rate sea level rise increasing ocean temperature climb new high every year continue increase threat coastal community especially significant storms
water actually recedes away shoreline back ocean wind push water shallow areas
hurricane landfall water recedes along coast storm wind blow land toward ocean exposing land usually water
ultimately water come back onshore much greater force inundating coastal communities
dangerous people often go bare uncovered land take photo grab seashell etc
water come back quickly went catching people guard
