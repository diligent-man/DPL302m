atlantic hurricane season typically reach peak week record-warm ocean temperature fueling hyperactive season expert say show sign slowing
average hurricane season start june run november statistical peak september
far year hurricane activity ha average every respect according phil klotzbach research scientist department atmospheric science colorado state university
slam dunk looking like season going classified above-normal
started forecaster predicted average season warned uncertainty usual climatic battle burgeoning el nio warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures
el nios tend produce wind shear upper-level wind rip storm apart warm water fuel growth
season started ocean warmth skyrocketed record level forecaster warned explosive tropical development active season something ha come fruition
saw hot atlantic wa said alright gotta go said klotzbach whose research group creates seasonal hurricane forecasts
thankfully strong el nio klotzbach said wa el nio season would probably tracking normal instead normal
klotzbach said el nio measure considered strong isnt affecting western atlantic like normally would
atlantic warm youre getting much shear would normally get klotzbach told cnn
compare big year atlantic wa really warm whole different ballgame year
extreme ocean heat low wind shear major effect season klotzbach said
storm able form would otherwise possible typical el nio year
even storm weakened moderate shear like hurricane franklin lee able stay alive restrengthen found favorable conditions
leave storm long enough eventually going find somewhere shear isnt strong strengthen klotzbach said
frequent rapid intensification major hurricane also byproduct season ripe conditions
idalia franklin lee rapidly intensified water running well normal
lee add growing trend intense hurricane powered warmer oceans
warm water thing need doe kind load dice toward high-end rapid intensification event klotzbach said
look water lee wa tracking degree celsius instead theyre degree celsius like rocket fuel
season isnt yet hurricane season activity happens mid-august mid-october klotzbach said next two week still look like could produce storms
beyond point anyones guess klotzbach said atlantic tinderbox ha already proven full surprise season
end day weve learned even strong el nio get atlantic warm enough hold klotzbach said
