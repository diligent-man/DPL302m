the storm packing maximum sustained winds of mph with higher gusts is expected to affect areas hundreds of miles beyond its center with several inches of rain as it treks up the coast according to the national hurricane center
a hurricane watch was issued for portions of eastern north carolina where water levels were rising along parts of the coast friday night
ophelia moved north northwest toward the east coast on friday at mph
the storm s center is forecast to approach north carolina s coast friday night the national hurricane center stated in an update
some additional strengthening cannot be ruled out as ophelia traverses the warm waters of the gulf stream on its approach to eastern north carolina
while this does not seem like the most likely outcome and is not explicitly forecast the increased risk warrants the issuance of a hurricane watch for a portion of the north carolina coast the hurricane center said
coastal areas will bear the brunt of the heaviest rains and wind though inland residents will get storms too
ophelia is targeting a landfall in north carolina saturday but by the time the storm s journey is done wind and rain will have reached as far north as southern new england

the heavy rain and wind affecting north carolina and virginia will worsen into the evening friday and affect more areas as the storm approaches the coast so tropical storm warnings stretch from just south of charleston south carolina to around the maryland delaware state line
storm surge watches and warnings stretch from surf city north carolina to the chesapeake bay
a few tornadoes are also possible in parts of the coastal mid atlantic
