Editor s Note CNN s continuing coverage of Hurricane Lee and Saturday s forecast can be found here
Hurricane Lee maintained major hurricane status Friday evening as the powerful storm s indirect yet dangerous impacts were expected to reach the waters of the East Coast as early as this weekend
The hurricane now a Category storm that briefly strengthened to a rare Category in the Atlantic Ocean is packing destructive maximum sustained winds of mph and is about miles east of the northern Leeward Islands as of p m ET Friday
Some fluctuations in intensity are likely over the next few days however Lee is expected to remain a powerful major hurricane through early next week the National Hurricane Center said
It s too soon to know whether this system will directly impact the US mainland but the storm will create dangerous coastal conditions like rip currents and large waves along the East Coast as soon as Sunday regardless of its final track
Lee which was a Category storm Thursday intensified with exceptional speed in warm ocean waters more than doubling its wind speeds to mph in just a day
The storm s winds increased by mph in a hour period which tied it with Hurricane Matthew for the third fastest rapid intensification in the Atlantic according to NOAA research meteorologist John Kaplan The monstrous hurricane struck Haiti in killing hundreds in the Caribbean nation while also wreaking havoc on parts of the US Southeast
The center of Lee will pass to the north of the Leeward Islands the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this weekend and into early next week Tropical storm conditions life threatening surf and rip currents could occur on some of these islands over the weekend
Lee hit a rare strength that few storms have ever achieved Only of storms in the Atlantic reach Category strength according to NOAA s hurricane database Including Lee only Category hurricanes have roamed the Atlantic since
Category is the highest level on the hurricane wind speed scale and has no maximum point Hurricanes hit this level when their sustained winds reach mph or higher A mph storm like Lee is the same category as Hurricane Allen the Atlantic s strongest hurricane on record which topped out at mph in
What rapid intensification means for hurricanes
Hurricanes need the perfect mixture of warm water moist air and light upper level winds to intensify enough to reach Category strength Lee had all of these especially warm water amid the warmest summer on record
Sea surface temperatures across the portion of the Atlantic Ocean that Lee is tracking through are a staggering degrees Celsius degrees Fahrenheit above normal after rising to far above record levels this summer according to David Zierden Florida s state climatologist
Reaching Category strength has become more common over the last decade Lee is the th Category since meaning of these exceptionally powerful hurricanes on record in NOAA s hurricane database have come in the last seven years
The Atlantic is not the only ocean to have spawned a monster storm in All seven ocean basins where tropical cyclones can form have had a storm reach Category strength so far this year including Hurricane Jova which reached Category status in the eastern Pacific earlier this week
Computer model trends for Lee have shown the hurricane taking a turn to the north early next week But exactly when that turn occurs and how far west Lee will manage to track by then will play a huge role in how close it gets to the US
Several steering factors at the surface and upper levels of the atmosphere will determine how close Lee will get to the East Coast
An area of high pressure over the Atlantic known as the Bermuda High will have a major influence in how quickly Lee turns The Bermuda High is expected to remain very strong into the weekend which will keep Lee on its current west northwestward track and slow it down a bit
As the high pressure weakens next week it will allow Lee to start moving northward
Once that turn to the north occurs the position of the jet stream strong upper level winds that can change the direction of a hurricane s path will influence how closely Lee is steered to the US
Lee could make a quick turn to the north early next week if high pressure weakens significantly
If the jet stream sets up along the East Coast it will act as a barrier that prevents Lee from approaching the coast This scenario would keep Lee farther away from the US coast but could bring the storm closer to Bermuda
Scenario Close to East Coast
Lee could make a slower turn to the north because the high pressure remains robust and the jet stream sets up farther inland over the Eastern US This scenario would leave portions of the East Coast mainly north of the Carolinas vulnerable to a much closer approach from Lee
All these factors have yet to come into focus and the hurricane is still at least seven days from being a threat to the East Coast Any potential US impact will become more clear as the Lee moves west in the coming days
