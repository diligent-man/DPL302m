expert fear already active hurricane season could come eventful exceptional end unusually warm storm-boosting ocean temperature slow-to-emerge el nio combine
atlantic season named storm ha already average according phil klotzbach hurricane researcher colorado state university
october usually signal change activity area storm form
first half october typically final stretch busiest time atlantic hurricane season
number storm usually begin drop quickly toward end october crater time season end november
storm form typically area much close comfort gulf mexico near bahamas western caribbean rather open atlantic storm like category hurricane lee formed earlier year
mean place like florida wa devastated category hurricane michael landfall october need particular guard normal october
however extremely high sea surface temperature across atlantic expand reach something might form late season year brian mcnoldy senior research associate university miami told cnn
could mean storm develop late season main development region large section open atlantic ocean stretch africa eastern caribbean
happen part eastern caribbean bermuda east coast could still risk tropical strikes
battle warm ocean water effect el nio ha posed forecasting challenge throughout hurricane season one factor seemingly negating other
el nio typically cause strong upper-level wind atlantic suppress hurricane activity
weaker upper-level wind favorable hurricane develop tend associated warmer ocean temperature exactly seen year fischer explained
balance warmer ocean temperature weaker wind winning storm able form would otherwise possible typical el nio year klotzbach previously told cnn
usually get back half hurricane season el nio tends dominate even atlantic warm
weve never seen anything warm michael fischer associate scientist university miami told cnn
could leave atlantic open tropical activity general rest season according fischer remains seen
kind uncharted water tough make kind confident forecast fischer told cnn
one thing certain though tropical system doe form would likely get extra boost strength exceptionally warm water according mcnoldy
ha already demonstrated multiple storm season including hurricane idalia hurricane lee rapidly intensified moving extremely warm water
possible upper-level wind remain abnormally low level across main development region caribbean effect el nio typically pronounced according fischer
combined high ocean temperature may leave nothing standing way tropical development
el nio point going say forget im charge klotzbach said
condition continue ripe tropical development end hurricane season itll add onto ha already abnormal season
lot thing going year unusual atlantic klotzbach added
