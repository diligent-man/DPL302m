experts fear an already active hurricane season could come to an eventful and exceptional end as unusually warm storm boosting ocean temperatures and a slow to emerge el ni o combine
the atlantic season and its named storms has already been above average according to phil klotzbach a hurricane researcher with colorado state university
but october usually signals changes in activity and the areas where storms form
the first half of october is typically the final stretch of the busiest time of the atlantic hurricane season
the number of storms usually begins to drop off quickly toward the end of october and craters by the time the season ends on november
storms that do form typically do so in areas that are much too close for comfort in the gulf of mexico near the bahamas and the western caribbean rather than in the open atlantic where storms like category hurricane lee formed earlier this year
this means places like florida which was devastated by category hurricane michael s landfall in october need to be on particular guard in a normal october
however extremely high sea surface temperatures across the atlantic expand the reach of where something might form into the late season this year brian mcnoldy a senior research associate at the university of miami told cnn
this could mean more storms develop late into the season in the main development region a large section of the open atlantic ocean that stretches from africa to the eastern caribbean
if this were to happen parts of the eastern caribbean bermuda and the east coast could still be at risk for tropical strikes
the battle between warm ocean water and the effect of el ni o has posed a forecasting challenge throughout this hurricane season as one factor is seemingly negating the other
el ni o typically causes strong upper level winds in the atlantic which suppress hurricane activity
but weaker upper level winds which are more favorable for hurricanes to develop tend to be associated with warmer ocean temperatures which is exactly what we have seen this year fischer explained
on balance the warmer ocean temperatures and weaker winds are winning and more storms have been able to form than would otherwise be possible in a typical el ni o year klotzbach previously told cnn
this clash is expected to continue into october and november
usually as we get into the back half of the hurricane season el ni o tends to dominate even if the atlantic is warm
but we ve just never seen anything this warm michael fischer an associate scientist with the university of miami told cnn
this could leave the atlantic open to more tropical activity in general through the rest of the season according to fischer but it remains to be seen
so we re kind of in uncharted waters if you will and it s tough to make any kind of confident forecast because of that fischer told cnn
one thing is for certain though any tropical system that does form would likely get an extra boost in strength from the exceptionally warm water according to mcnoldy
this has already been demonstrated by multiple storms this season including hurricane idalia and hurricane lee both of which rapidly intensified while moving over extremely warm water
an el ni o winter is coming
here s what that could mean for the us
it s possible that upper level winds will remain at abnormally low levels across the main development region and the caribbean where the effect of el ni o is typically most pronounced according to fischer
this combined with high ocean temperatures may leave nothing standing in the way of tropical development
is el ni o at some point going to say forget this i m in charge klotzbach said
i don t see massive signs of that
if conditions continue to be ripe for tropical development through the end of hurricane season it ll add onto what has already been an abnormal season
there are a lot of things going on this year that are unusual in the atlantic klotzbach added
we have an atlantic that s in a different kind of league from other years
