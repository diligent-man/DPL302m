fall has only just begun but it s not too soon to look ahead to winter especially since this one may look drastically different than recent years because of el ni o
this winter will be the first in a few years to feel the effects of the phenomenon which has a sizable impact on the weather during the coldest months of the year
el ni o is one of three phases of the el ni o southern oscillation which tracks water temperature changes in the equatorial pacific ocean that can have rippling effects on weather patterns around the globe
the el ni o phase occurs when these ocean temperatures are warmer than normal for an extended period
this year s el ni o began in june is expected to be strong this winter and last at least into early next spring according to noaa s climate prediction center
el ni o s cooler counterpart la ni a played a huge role in the past three winters across the us keeping the south dry while parts of the west received a lot of much needed snow
early winter predictions from the climate prediction center have many of the hallmarks of typical el ni o winters auguring changes to come
no two el ni o winters are the same but many have temperature and precipitation trends in common
one of the major reasons is the position of the jet stream which often shifts south during an el ni o winter
this shift typically brings wetter and cooler weather to the south while the north becomes drier and warmer according to noaa
because the jet stream is essentially a river of air that storms flow through they can move across the south with increased frequency during an el ni o winter
more storms means more precipitation typically from the southern plains to the southeast
this could be crucial for states like texas louisiana and mississippi plagued by drought
the combination of cooler weather and more frequent precipitation may also increase the chances for wintry precipitation like freezing rain sleet and snow to fall in the south
el ni o typically leads to a milder winter in the north from the pacific northwest to the rockies plains and midwest
individual storms can still form and deliver bouts of brutal cold or heavy snow to these regions but they are typically less frequent
this would be bad news for portions of the midwest also dealing with extreme and exceptional levels of drought and for snowpack in the pacific northwest a key water source for the region
el ni o winter patterns are less regular in california the southwest and the northeast
the frequency of storms and uptick in precipitation across california and portions of the southwest may depend on the overall strength of the el ni o
a stronger el ni o may lead to more storms low elevation rain and high elevation snow while a weaker version could hang the southwest out to dry
the northeast doesn t have a well defined set of expectations during an el ni o winter
the region can be milder overall like its other northern counterparts but it can also be at the mercy of robust coastal storms moving along the atlantic coast
looking back at recent el ni o winters can also help visualize what the upcoming winter may have in store
