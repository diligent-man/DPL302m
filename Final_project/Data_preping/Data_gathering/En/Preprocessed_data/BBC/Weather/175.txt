by the time the silver state hotshot crew arrived from nevada a few weeks ago canada s wildfires had already scorched millions of acres and shattered all time burning records
so everyone already knew what they were up against
in the scope for us in the states this would one of the largest fires to occur ever it s a gigafire said zac krohn a division supervisor with the us forest service as he briefed the hotshot crew on another steamy day in northern quebec
the firefighters on saturday took in the instructions suited up shouldered axes and chain saws and hiked into burned and barren forests looking for dangerous hotspots still smoldering
at this point we re just trying to secure the edge and protect the community said krohn
there was no taming these wildfires now they were too vast and too hot he said
crews know the work will be brutal they have long days as much as hours traveling to new areas detected as hotspots and sometimes hiking hours to get to them
canada is already on pace to have its worst wildfire season in recorded history and the season is little more than half over
there are more than fires burning throughout the country and the canadian interagency forest fire centre says at least of the current wildfires are out of control according to its website
and the conflagrations are having an enormous impact on canada s neighbor as well forecasters predicted around million americans on monday would see decreased visibility and poor air quality including residents of chicago detroit new york st
louis and cleveland
smoke from the canadian wildfires had drifted south by monday evening blanketing north georgia atlanta and other parts of the southeast according to the national weather service in atlanta
the smoky conditions could linger in the atlanta and the north georgia area through tuesday and over central and south georgia possibly until wednesday nws meteorologist ansley long told cnn
canadian wildfire smoke puts around million us residents under air quality alerts
it s no understatement to say that the fire season is and will continue to be record breaking in a number of ways said michael norton a director general with canada s northern forestry centre during a technical briefing earlier this month
the total area burned now exceeds any year on record since we started measuring and keeping accurate records he said
according to data this weekend the country set yet another record with nearly million acres consumed an area nearly the size of ohio
when it s the year to burn and the conditions are right it s just going to continue to burn
the best thing we can do as an incident management team is to focus on protection of people and communities said matt rau an incident commander with the southwest area incident management team based in the united states
for weeks now rau s hotshot crews have been scanning blackened and scarred forests from the air and on the ground trying to assess how best to protect people and property
amid the clich on everyone s lips that canada isn t out of the woods yet firefighters pitching in from all over the world are taking in the scope of this emergency
the wildfires continue to defy history even though an increased number of firefighters and rainfall have managed to at least mitigate some of the damage
but the work is dangerous
on sunday canadian authorities announced a second firefighter had died battling the wildfires
officials cautioned that any rain was like a drop in an otherwise empty bucket with nearly every region in the grips of some stage of drought
temperatures were hotter than usual during the spring and severe weather and lightning strikes ignited forests already compromised by climate change
a new outbreak of canadian wildfires is sending a plume of unhealthy smoke into the us yet again
when they burn like this there s no way to even put people in front of it to stop the fire there s no amount of resources on the ground or from the sky that s going to be able to stop of these fires when they get the momentum said rau
his base of operations is in lebel sur qu villon a quebec town that has already evacuated twice since fire season started
international crews from the us south korea south africa portugal and several other countries have pitched in coordinating with canadian resources that are already stretched
and this weekend the canadian government called in the military to help battle new blazes in western provinces
bill blair the emergency preparedness minister tweeted that he had approved a request for federal assistance and the armed forces would be deployed
the town of chibougamau quebec is still on edge after evacuating the entire community of about in a matter of hours in june
mayor manon cyr on describing the decision to evacuate said strangely i wasn t scared i was mad
and then i have to calm down and say manon you have a job to do
and that s why i said to my people let s stay calm let s be patient keep it zen
residents have been back for weeks but they know the threat will continue through summer maybe longer
don t be surprised if it continues and secondly this is a problem that is going to go on into the future said rau
that also applies to us residents who once again this week will be dealing with air quality alerts now from wildfires in canada s west he said
