Hurricane Lee rapidly intensified at a historic pace into a Category storm Thursday night adding to a spate of extremely intense hurricanes this year and in recent decades which experts say is a symptom of the climate crisis
Lee is now the eighth Category storm in the North Atlantic since which means of Category hurricanes on record in the basin have occurred in the last seven years a CNN analysis of NOAA’s hurricane database shows
This year alone Category storms have already appeared in all seven ocean basins where tropical cyclones form including Hurricane Jova which also rapidly strengthened into a Category storm earlier this week
The increase in Category or storms especially that we’ve seen over the last couple years due to the increase in rapid intensification is a telltale sign of climate change which is exactly what we expect to see in a warmer world Kevin Reed a hurricane expert and professor at Stony Brook University’s school of marine and atmospheric sciences told CNN
Planet-warming pollution made summer heat twice as likely for nearly all of humanity
Jim Kossin a hurricane expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Brooklyn-based nonprofit First Street Foundation agrees
He cautions the NOAA database had not fully counted storms prior to the satellite era and while advances in technology have made it easier to measure hurricanes it is still difficult to determine the real trend
Still he said at the breakneck pace at which the oceans are warming high intensity tropical cyclones are likely occurring more often
It is very likely that there are more Category storms now than there were years ago Kossin told CNN
The primary way in which storms reach Category or strength is by undergoing a rapid intensification process — when a storm’s winds strengthen rapidly by at least mph in hours or less said Reed
It’s just one of the ways experts say the climate crisis is making hurricanes more dangerous as warmer waters allow for storms to strengthen quicker and reach higher categories on the hurricane wind speed scale
More than of warming around the globe over the past years has taken place in the oceans according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
The short of it is as the sea surface temperatures warm because of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions the likelihood that any event will undergo rapid intensification will increase Reed said
Rapid intensification has been happening more and more as storms are approaching landfall making them harder to prepare for
Hurricane Idalia rapidly intensified by mph in hours before landfall along Florida’s Big Bend as a Category hurricane late last month
And in the North Atlantic where ocean temperatures have been off the charts storms like Lee have had quite a feast
Lee’s winds increased mph in hours the third-fastest a storm has rapidly intensified on record in the Atlantic Ocean according to NOAA research meteorologist John Kaplan
There is little doubt that the exceptionally warm ocean waters we’re seeing have a human fingerprint on them Kossin said
Add to this the warming effects of the El Niño happening this year and we have a recipe for breaking a lot of temperature records
Kossin noted this is especially true in the eastern North Pacific where warming from a growing El Niño is most concentrated
Jova is sitting in the middle of this and the warm water certainly fueled the rapid intensification he added
One thing is for certain As the world’s oceans continue to warm experts say the frequency at which these top-of-scale storms can occur and intensify will only increase
