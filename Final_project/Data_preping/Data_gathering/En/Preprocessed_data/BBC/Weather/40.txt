Editor’s Note CNN’s continuing coverage of Hurricane Lee and Friday’s forecast can be found here
Hurricane Lee unleashed strong winds and tropical storm conditions on Bermuda ahead of a track that will bring heavy rain wind and coastal flooding to coastal New England and Atlantic Canada on Friday and through the weekend
After days of uncertainty there’s little time left for Lee’s track to change considerably and confidence has grown now that the massive storm has completed its long-awaited northward turn and begun to pick up its pace
Lee is expected to track far enough away from the East Coast to avoid delivering a substantial blow to a more widespread and inland area of New England but will still affect the coast ahead of a weekend landfall somewhere between northeast Maine and the Canadian province of Nova Scotia
Parts of the East Coast were already feeling the storm’s effects Thursday including dangerous surf and rip current conditions according to the National Hurricane Center
Janet Mills declared a state of emergency Thursday afternoon and requested federal assistance in preparation for Lee’s arrival
Lee’s core was about miles west of Bermuda as of Thursday night and was churning with maximum sustained winds of mph a Category hurricane according to the hurricane center
An island-wide tropical storm warning is in effect for Bermuda as Lee tracks west of the island
Power outages mounted across Bermuda on Thursday afternoon as Lee’s winds battered the island according to the island’s utility provider
Winds gusted up to mph at Bermuda’s LF
Hurricane and tropical storm watches have been issued for many of New England’s coastal residents in anticipation of the colossal storm’s impact on Friday and through the weekend
A tropical storm warning issued along New England’s coast was extended northward to the US and Canada border the hurricane center said in a pm
And a tropical storm warning in effect for the coast of Massachusetts was extended westward to Westport according to the advisory
Though the storm is expected to weaken as it approaches land it will still have a massive radius of damaging winds that could pound coastal New England and Canada’s Atlantic provinces
As of Thursday night hurricane-force winds extended up to miles from its center and tropical storm-force winds stretched for up to miles according to the hurricane center
Hurricane-strength winds are possible from the northern coast of Maine into portions of the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia on Saturday
Tropical storm-force wind gusts are possible across a much larger area of New England and Atlantic Canada
'Catastrophic flooding' damages hundreds of homes as a Massachusetts city engulfed in water is now at risk of dam failure
These strong winds will contribute to storm surge flooding up to feet that could inundate parts of the southeast Massachusetts coast late Friday and Saturday
Heavy rainfall could pose a flood threat to some already rain-drenched areas of the Northeast where saturated ground may be particularly susceptible to flash flooding
Lee’s heaviest rain will fall over portions of Maine Saturday but states like New Hampshire Massachusetts and Rhode Island are not completely in the clear
Lee could deliver to inches of rain from Rhode Island to northern Maine while to inches of rain can fall across the Massachusetts Cape and much of Maine
Repeated downpours may bring up to inches of rain to southeastern Maine
The softened soil combined with stiff wind gusts will also increase the likelihood of downed trees which in turn could knock out essential power lines and cause outages
Areas at and near the coast which will feel the strongest of Lee’s winds will be the most at risk of wind damage and power outages
