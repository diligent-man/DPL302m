Record long extreme heat streaks are finally coming to an end but despite the signs of relief the dangerous heat isn t going away completely The relentless heat dome driving the deadly heat wave will meander across the southern tier of the US this week bringing more record breaking temperatures
The numbers so far this summer have been jaw dropping In El Paso Texas the high temperature topped degrees for a record breaking straight days in Miami the heat index stayed above degrees for consecutive days and in Phoenix temperatures have been at or above degrees for consecutive days
All of those streaks will have ended by Monday if Phoenix hits its closer to average forecast high of degrees
It s been so hot for so long the average temperature for Phoenix for the month of July set a record at degrees shattering the previous one by degrees It goes to show this heat has been exceptional even for one of the nation s hottest cities
It s been a year of abnormalities and streaks so it s just a testament to just how strange this year has been said Ryan Worley meteorologist for the National Weather Service office in Phoenix
Why temperatures have been so hot
Phoenix has yet to join other parts of the state with measurable monsoon rain something that the city is desperately counting on to cool temperatures down If Phoenix receives rainfall Monday it would be the third latest monsoon rainfall on record
The city will get a slight break from the heat Monday and Tuesday as the threat of monsoon rains rolls through but highs will be back up above degrees by midweek possibly making it to degrees by the weekend
Meanwhile with little rain for relief more than million people across the Deep South and Southern Plains are still under heat alerts More than potential high temperature records could fall again this week as the oppressive heat shows no signs of backing down across the country s midsection
It is especially true in Dallas The city could experience its hottest days of the year this week with highs potentially topping degrees on Tuesday
High temperatures will stay in the triple digits all the way through the weekend at times running as much as degrees above normal
Little Rock Arkansas Baton Rouge Louisiana and Houston will feel as hot as degrees or higher Monday and much of the week with no relief in sight Unfortunately there is no real chance of cooler temperatures for some of the hottest locations for the foreseeable future as this dome of high pressure responsible for the extreme heat won t budge
