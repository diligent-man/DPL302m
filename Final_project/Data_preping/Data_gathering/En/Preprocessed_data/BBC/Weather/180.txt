Canadian wildfire smoke is bringing unhealthy air across the northern tier of the United States to start the week triggering air quality alerts for more than a dozen states from Montana to Vermont
Forecasters predicted around million people would see decreased visibility and poor air quality including residents of Chicago Detroit New York St
On Monday the plume of smoke stretched across the US like a noxious belt with several states experiencing unhealthy air which is Level of on the Air Quality Index
Some of the unhealthy air stretched as far south as northern Alabama on Monday morning

Kathy Hochul said in a news release
The state is activating emergency notifications on roads and making masks available for distribution Hochul said
Winds will continue to push the smoke eastward bringing a smoky haze to the Northeast early in the week
The plume was birthed from nearly fires ignited in Canada’s province of British Columbia in the past week nearly half of which were started by lightning strikes from thunderstorms the British Columbia Wildfire Service said
Some of those thunderstorms were dry or produced inconsequential amounts of rain to help quench any fires a dangerous prospect in a province experiencing the worst level of drought
The province is expected to receive federal assistance to help with its ongoing wildfires according to a Sunday news release from Public Safety Canada
There are more than fires burning throughout Canada and the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says at least of the current wildfires are out of control according to its website

Wildfire smoke contains tiny pollutants known as particle matter or PM that can get into the lungs and bloodstream once inhaled
These pollutants most commonly cause difficulty breathing and eye and throat irritation but have also been linked to more serious long-term health issues like lung cancer according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Wildfires send plume of unhealthy smoke into the US yet again
Parts of the US will be at risk of smoke for the foreseeable future depending on weather patterns and fire flare-ups because Canada is experiencing its worst fire season on record
More than million acres have burned so far this year an area roughly the size of Indiana
British Columbia has had more than fires start since April
Those fires have already burned through nearly three times the amount of land compared to an average year in British Columbia over the last years the province’s wildfire service said
