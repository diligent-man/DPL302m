record dry streaks and a long lasting ridge of high pressure are teaming up to lock in dangerous heat and trigger an expanding drought across parts of the southwest and texas
this is particularly true in phoenix which just endured the hottest month on record for any us city and still hasn t had any measurable rain even though the monsoon season which is responsible for bringing the southwest at least of its annual rainfall started nearly two months ago
phoenix is currently experiencing its driest three month period on record fueled by the second latest first rain of the monsoon season
this in combination with the much talked about stubborn area of high pressure will keep temperatures in record territory for the foreseeable future
phoenix needs monsoon rain to break the heat
it brings added moisture cloud cover and rain which can moderate temperatures especially from oppressive afternoon highs
it s getting drier by the day with nothing more than a to chance of rain through the week
extreme heat has killed people in counties coroners report
the real number is likely much higher
highs in phoenix are expected to come down slightly this week from a scorching degrees on saturday down to a forecast high of degrees on wednesday
however the added monsoonal moisture will bring the humidity levels higher which means the heat index or feels like temperature will be higher
it s a no win situation right now unless they get rain
by the end of the week moisture decreases and so do the chances for rain
and you guessed it temperatures climb right back up to degrees
the lack of rain is also putting the lone star state in a dire drought situation which is causing the threat of fires to grow
it s just going to keep deteriorating said logan scherschel fire analyst for texas a m forest service
there s a pretty good recipe for a bad week coming up because the fields have been drying out for over a month
due to a significant increase in fire activity across the state potential for large fires as well as the increased commitment of state and local resources to fires texas a m forest service has raised the state preparedness level to level pl

texas had a really wet spring which produced a lot of fresh grass growth
then the summer has been very dry and very hot
several texas cities including waco austin houston midland san angelo and del rio have had little to no rainfall during the last few months and are all now experiencing their driest day stretch on record
the heat is also helping dry out the ground even more
el paso is expected to hit degrees monday then hover around degrees the rest of the week
the city has had days this year with temperatures above degrees breaking the record for the most such days
austin is also expected to stay around degrees all week
the city endured consecutive days above degrees ending in late july which was an all time record
much of the new grass that grew during the spring is dead now creating the perfect fuel for the spread of fires
we re starting to not only see a lot of fires easily started and carried by the grass but they re starting to get what we call significant fires because they get very resistant to control as the brush and trees start burning scherschel explained
texas has had more than fires burn in the last seven days alone most of those in the more populated areas of the state from dallas to houston to san antonio
so even if fires don t get thousands and thousands of acres in size a small fire can still impact a pretty good sized population scherschel said
much of the state is under heat alerts on monday
there is also an elevated fire risk for west and central texas
the combination of extremely hot temperatures rh relative humidity and very dry fuels has resulted in aggressive fire behavior according to the storm prediction center
more than of texas is in drought with a small pocket of the most extreme level of drought covering the hill country
according to scherschel they need rain and a lot of it
pretty much at this point it s going to take some type of season ending event such as like a tropical storm or hurricane to bring a lot of gulf moisture a lot of rainfall on a lot of real estate scherschel said
