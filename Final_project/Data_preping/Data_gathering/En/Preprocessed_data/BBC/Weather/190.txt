el nio wind slow even reverse direction allowing warmer water spread eastward way south america
scientist still searching answer happens slowing wind last week months
el nios among many large-scale weather pattern act tandem influence global weather occur every two seven year varying intensity water eastern pacific degree fahrenheit degree celsius warmer usual
el nio spanish mean little boy opposite la nia little girl climate pattern

influence climate crisis el nio still matter debate
climate change could make el nios impact worse recent study show
overall number el nios unlikely increase planet warms amplified so-called super el nios twice likely research suggests
among likely byproduct global warming extreme precipitation event warmer temperature hold water vapor atmosphere
