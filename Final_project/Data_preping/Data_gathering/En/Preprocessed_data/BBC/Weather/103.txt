here s a look at the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan in march of
march at p m a magnitude earthquake takes place miles northeast of tokyo at a depth of miles
the earthquake causes a tsunami with foot waves that damage several nuclear reactors in the area
it is the largest earthquake ever to hit japan
source japan s fire and disaster management agency
the combined total of confirmed deaths and missing is more than nearly deaths and missing
deaths were caused by the initial earthquake and tsunami and by post disaster health conditions
at the time of the earthquake japan had nuclear reactors with two under construction and power plants which produced about of japan s electricity iaea
material damage from the earthquake and tsunami is estimated at about trillion yen billion
there are six reactors at tokyo electric power company s fukushima daiichi plant located about km miles south of sendai
a microsievert msv is an internationally recognized unit measuring radiation dosage
people are typically exposed to a total of about microsieverts in one year
the japanese government estimated that the tsunami swept about five million tons of debris offshore but that sank leaving million tons floating in the pacific ocean
the debris was not considered to be radioactive

march at p m an magnitude earthquake takes place miles northeast of tokyo
original recorded magnitude later upgraded to then the pacific tsunami warning center issues a tsunami warning for the pacific ocean from japan to the us
about an hour after the quake waves up to feet high hit the japanese coast sweeping away vehicles causing buildings to collapse and severing roads and highways
the japanese government declares a state of emergency for the nuclear power plant near sendai miles from tokyo
sixty to seventy thousand people living nearby are ordered to evacuate to shelters
march overnight a magnitude aftershock hits the nagano and niigata prefectures usgs at a m a nuclear emergency is declared at fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant
officials report the earthquake and tsunami have cut off the plant s electrical power and that backup generators have been disabled by the tsunami
another aftershock hits the west coast of honshu magnitude
a m the japanese nuclear and industrial safety agency announces that radiation near the plant s main gate is more than eight times the normal level cooling systems at three of the four units at the fukushima daini plant fail prompting state of emergency declarations there at least six million homes of japan s households are without electricity and a million are without water the us geological survey says the quake appears to have moved honshu japan s main island by eight feet and has shifted the earth on its axis about people half the town s population are reported to be unaccounted for in minamisanriku on japan s pacific coast
march people living within kilometers miles of the fukushima daini and kilometers of the fukushima daiichi power plants begin a government ordered evacuation
the total evacuated so far is about japan self defense forces personnel aircraft and ships are deployed to help with rescue efforts a government official says a partial meltdown may be occurring at the damaged fukushima daiichi plant sparking fears of a widespread release of radioactive material
so far three units there have experienced major problems in cooling radioactive material

an explosion at the daiichi plant no
reactor causes a building s wall to collapse injuring six
the residents remaining within kilometers of the plant despite an earlier evacuation order have been ordered to stay indoors
the no
reactor at the daiichi plant loses its cooling capabilities
officials quickly work to pump seawater into the reactor as they have been doing with two other reactors at the same plant and the situation is resolved
workers scramble to cool down fuel rods at two other reactors at the plant no
and no
rolling blackouts begin in parts of tokyo and eight prefectures
downtown tokyo is not included
up to million people will be affected in the rolling outages which are scheduled to last until april
march the third explosion at the daiichi plant in four days damages the suppression pool of reactor no
water continues to be injected into pressure vessels in order to cool down radioactive material
march the nuclear safety agency investigates the cause of a white cloud of smoke rising above the fukushima daiichi plant
plans are canceled to use helicopters to pour water onto fuel rods that may have burned after a fire there causing a spike in radiation levels
the plume is later found to have been vapor from a spent fuel storage pool in a rare address emperor akihito tells the nation to not give up hope that we need to understand and help each other a televised address by a sitting emperor is an extraordinarily rare event in japan usually reserved for times of extreme crisis or war after hydrogen explosions occur in three of the plant s reactors and chief cabinet secretary yukio edano says radiation levels do not pose a direct threat to the human body between to miles to kilometers from the plant
march gregory jaczko head of the nuclear regulatory commission tells us congress that spent fuel rods in the no
reactor have been exposed because there is no water in the spent fuel pool resulting in the emission of extremely high levels of radiation
helicopters operated by japan s self defense forces begin dumping tons of seawater from the pacific ocean on to the no
reactor to reduce overheating
radiation levels hit millisieverts per hour at an annex building where workers have been trying to re establish electrical power the highest registered at that building so far tokyo electric power co
march japan s nuclear and industrial safety agency raises the threat level from to putting it on a par with the three mile island accident in pennsylvania
the international nuclear events scale says a level incident means there is a likelihood of a release of radioactive material several deaths from radiation and severe damage to the reactor core
