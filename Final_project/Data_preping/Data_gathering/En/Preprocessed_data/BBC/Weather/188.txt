a derecho is a significant potentially destructive weather event that is characterized as having widespread long lived straight line winds associated with a fast moving group of severe thunderstorms
snowfall tops feet and rainfall tops inches across southern california
here s what you need to know about derechos
while there s no official or universal definition for a derecho it is classified by a swath of wind damage extending more than miles with wind gusts of mph or greater along most of its length according to the storm prediction center
the spc increased the required path of damage by more than from miles to miles in january based on a study
the hope was that the added rigor would help reserve the term derecho for the most impactful long lasting and widespread events spc meteorologists told cnn
we re really trying to highlight with just one word the worst most damaging wind event that you can potentially expect matt elliott spc warning coordination meteorologist told cnn
if we can keep it to these higher end events then it can be really meaningful because when you hear that term it s means that we re talking about something extremely serious
these wind events arise when storms form a continuous and narrow band of thunderstorms ahead of a cold front also called a squall line cnn reported
their destruction can be similar to that of tornadoes but it is typically in one direction along a fairly straight path the weather service says hence it s name which is spanish for straight ahead derecho damage is frequently referred to as straight line wind damage
these storms are also known to have several well separated mile per hour wind gusts and may also cause tornadoes and heavy rains that can bring flash flooding
winds of to mph are equivalent to a category hurricane
derechos are typically associated with lines of thunderstorms that will bow out into a curved shape as winds begin to spread out horizontally
known as a bow echo these storm bands can develop from a cluster of thunderstorms or just a single storm according to the weather service
the storm band advances when new thunderstorms form as warm air is forced upwards by the cooler air spreading out
if this band of storms travels more than miles and has gusts of over mph it becomes a derecho
these intense wind events thrive on the border of a strong area of high pressure aloft where the greatest overlap of hot and dry conditions and stronger wind aloft occurs according to the weather service
a derecho is forecast to bring damaging hurricane force winds to the central us today
derechos are sometimes preceded by ominous looking shelf clouds according to the storm prediction center
their clouds can also appear darker than other storms
the storms are more common in warmer weather conditions according to the weather service with of them occurring between may and august
from september through april derechos are most likely to occur from east texas into the southeastern states they said
winds within a derecho can be as strong as a tornado knocking out trees powerlines mobile homes barns and other similar structures according to the storm prediction center
they are most dangerous to those outdoors whether in a rural or urban area
however cities are particularly vulnerable to these high winds due to damage to electrical and communication lines falling trees and damage to buildings
in august a severe thunderstorm event impacted the midwest as a derecho and produced severe wind damage across nebraska iowa illinois wisconsin illinois and indiana
derecho moves southeast after storms leave more than million without power overnight
the derecho s billion in damage places it among the top three costliest severe storm events ever alongside two major tornado outbreaks in tropical cyclones are ranked separately from severe storms
the derecho caused widespread power outages devastated trees and damaged crops
more than million people over an area of square miles were affected
in iowa and illinois alone over million people were left without power
update the storm prediction center changed its definition of a derecho in january increasing the required path of damage to more than miles
it made the change to reflect the latest science on the topic to better align with other weather authorities that had adopted the change and to increase the consistency of communication across all of its websites an agency spokesperson said
this story has been updated to reflect the newest definition
