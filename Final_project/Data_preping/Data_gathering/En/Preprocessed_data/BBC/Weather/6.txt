Hurricanes are rated according to intensity of sustained winds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale

A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane.

The team forecasts 13 named storms, including six hurricanes, two of which will be major hurricanes.

August 10, 2023 - NOAA releases its updated forecast, upping the odds for an above average hurricane season from 30% to 60% as ocean temperatures continue to climb above record levels this summer
The agency now predicts 14-21 named storms, including six to 11 hurricanes, of which two to five are forecast to be major
