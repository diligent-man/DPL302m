record-high ocean temperature setting stage active atlantic hurricane season explosive tropical development one thing missing storms
tropical storm atlantic basin nearly month none far year come close united states
ocean heat running high expert urging people get safety plan place prepare tropical trouble could start within next couple weeks
updated outlook national oceanic atmospheric administration thursday called above-average hurricane season increase near-normal forecast released may
increased chance normal activity matthew rosencrans lead hurricane season forecaster noaa climate prediction center said news release
rosencrans told cnn wa moderate confidence condition become conducive tropical development within week two
forecaster honing development potential open atlantic time september forecast line typical climatology
noaa forecaster join expert field recently increased hurricane risk outlook including researcher colorado state university
forecast leaning several climatological factor also exceptionally warm ocean provide storm fuel needed explode strength even undergo rapid intensification
noaa said sea surface temperature warmer anticipated major factor increasing odds active season
considering factor updated outlook call activity urge everyone prepare continuing season rosencrans said
especially case atlantic sea surface temperature much average area hurricane typically form
notably sea surface temperature part gulf mexico middle low fahrenheit well degree needed sustain tropical storm development
water temperature even recently climbed degree shallower water closer florida coast
even abundance warm water tropical development ha occurred atlantic since hurricane dissipated late july
despite lack u impact far five named storm putting season slightly climatological normal tropical activity
recent sign tropical atlantic could soon spring life
several thunderstorm area come close developing torn apart two thing wind shear change strength wind different level atmosphere dry air cut storm lifeblood thunderstorm activity
wind shear dry air largely warm ocean water past week suppressing hurricane activity
altogether unusual wind shear typically strong start hurricane season gradually begin ease july august
much reduction wind shear dry air occurs headed typical peak hurricane season question
notably el nio present growing pacific ocean ocean weather pattern typically promotes increase wind shear make atlantic hurricane season le active
rosencrans said el nios influence yet arrive atlantic could september
said already sign wind shear lessening area atlantic storm typically form lower normal wind shear wa expected season factored expectation increase activity
global ocean temperature soared highest level record week
wind shear lessens dry air exit hurricane season race extreme ocean temperature ready fuel stronger storms
take last year instance two storm alex colin already impacted u time last year colins dissipation wa quickly followed lengthy inactive stretch additional storm formed july august
september arrived along came quick uptick activity culminated devastating hurricane ian slamming u end month
tropical activity spike across atlantic mid-august mid-october due relative minimum wind shear relative maximum sea surface temperatures
period alone account astounding major hurricane day season according noaa
even tropical activity doesnt pick considerably next week storm doe manage form warm water wind shear inhibit ha potential explode strength turn dangerous fast
hot water place near highly populated area gulf atlantic coast disaster quickly strike tropical system able tap abundant energy
