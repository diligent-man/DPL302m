here s a look at earthquakes worldwide
the us geological survey describes an earthquake as the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault
stresses in the earth s outer layer push the sides of the fault together
stress builds up and the rocks slip suddenly releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth s crust and cause the shaking that we feel during an earthquake
earthquakes are measured using seismographs which monitor the seismic waves that travel through the earth after an earthquake strikes
scientists used the richter scale for many years to measure earthquakes but now largely follow the moment magnitude scale which usgs says is a more accurate measure of size
