yet another record has fallen in this summer s extreme weather epicenter of phoenix but this one is doing more than fueling the heat it s a sign of a much more widespread issue developing in the southwest
phoenix is experiencing its driest start to summer after recording no measurable rainfall monday a new record for the latest start to the region s monsoon in the city
the troubling new milestone is emblematic of a much larger problem in the southwest which relies on the monsoon for much of its rain
monsoons which occur in several continents are seasonal shifts in wind direction that transports moisture into the region
the north american monsoon provides parts of the southwest to of its annual rainfall but many cities across the region are pacing to behind average rainfall amounts since june when the monsoon typically begins
this lack of rainfall during a critical time of the year has for weeks enhanced the region s exceptional heat and expanding drought

parts of phoenix did see rain on two days in july but because it didn t fall at the city s official reporting station it didn t count toward city records
only to of the phoenix metro area experienced the rain said alex young a meteorologist for the national weather service in phoenix
that rainfall was light according to nws data only amounting to between to inches across the two days
these rainfall totals account for at most to of what typically falls during july and occurred across only a fraction of the city s footprint
and phoenix s rainfall woes have been growing well before the normal start to the monsoon nws data shows
nothing more than a trace of rain has been recorded at the city s official reporting station since march
monday marked consecutive days without measurable precipitation further cementing phoenix s second longest dry streak on record
the longest dry stretch on record for phoenix stands at days and occurred more than years ago from december to june
phoenix isn t the only city missing out on most of its monsoon rainfall
flagstaff arizona has recorded about of its typical rainfall since monsoon season began and albuquerque new mexico has only seen around
minimal rainfall has led to abnormal dryness and drought across at least of new mexico and of arizona the us drought monitor reported last week
how long phoenix s dry spell will last depends on a brewing stormy setup later this week across portions of the southwest including eastern and central arizona
there s a chance phoenix will receive rainfall at some point friday or saturday meaning the day record might not be broken
the lack of rainfall is driving this summer s heat even higher
sun shining on dry ground typically results in higher temperatures because none of the sun s energy is used to evaporate moisture and more of it can be converted into heat
cloud cover can also have a significant influence as it affects how much sun reaches the ground
throw in several intense heat domes and a plethora of records have fallen in phoenix this summer
phoenix had not only its hottest month on record in july but also the hottest month ever recorded for any us city
how much water is left in the colorado river scientists and officials are scrambling to find out
the city endured a record breaking consecutive days from june to july where high temperatures reached or exceeded degrees
phoenix has had days so far this year where temperatures met or surpassed degrees just days behind s all time record of days
and the heat hasn t stopped stop once the sun goes down
phoenix has had days of low temperatures at or above degrees this year which ties the record set in
low temperatures in the hottest part of the summer tend to hover in the low to middle s but one day in july set an all time record when temperatures failed to fall below degrees
when heat doesn t abate at night it can quickly become dangerous especially for those without reliable access to air conditioning
on average nights are warming faster than days in most of the us as a consequence of the climate crisis
at least deaths have been attributed to extreme heat in with a majority of the reported deaths occurring in arizona
as of early august more than people had died due to heat in arizona alone
