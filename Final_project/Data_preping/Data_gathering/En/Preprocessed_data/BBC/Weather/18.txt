A high-impact flood event is taking shape for the New York City area as a coastal storm moves in overnight and threatens to dump prolific amounts of rain Friday
Millions of people in the New York tri-state area face a Level of moderate risk for flash flooding the National Weather Service warned
Intense rainfall rates topping inch an hour are possible throughout the day
Rainfall that intense could cause serious flash flooding on roads and even in subway stations
The rain will begin for many starting Thursday night peaking on Friday and Friday night
New York City Emergency Management issued a travel advisory starting at am
Saturday warning of potentially widespread travel impacts during the morning commute
New York City will be under a flood watch starting tomorrow and we urge New Yorkers to prepare for heavy rain and potential flooding throughout Friday and Saturday morning NYC Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol said
All New Yorkers need to exercise caution
If you must travel consider using public transportation and allow for extra travel time and if you must drive do not enter flooded roadways
Iscol also warned of potential basement flooding something that proved particularly deadly in the area when Hurricane Ida’s remnants wrung out epic amounts of rain two years ago
Widespread rainfall totals between and inches are expected but those totals could climb to between and inches in spots where particularly intense bands of rain set up and linger
The bull’s-eye for the worst rain is from central New Jersey northward through Manhattan and Long Island and into southern Connecticut and the Hudson Valley
Flooding could happen even in areas that only receive one inch of rain since the ground is already saturated across many areas of the Northeast from recent heavy rainfall
At least two inches of rain has fallen over the last seven days from Virginia through Massachusetts with some areas picking up over four inches
The system will be very slow to exit the region this weekend so more rain is expected on Saturday
The sun finally returns in full force on Sunday as rainfall-limiting high pressure returns to the Northeast and mid-Atlantic
Another factor may exacerbate flooding across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic a supermoon
The fourth and final supermoon of will occur Friday morning creating more extreme tidal cycles that could increase the flood potential in communities along the East Coast
As a result coastal flood advisories extend more than miles from Bridgeport Connecticut through Virginia Beach
Up to one foot of inundation above ground level is expected in low-lying areas near shorelines and tidal waterways
The weather service warns some partial or full road closures are possible
Rip currents and very high surf are another concern
At least people have died in rip currents so far this year NOAA data shows
