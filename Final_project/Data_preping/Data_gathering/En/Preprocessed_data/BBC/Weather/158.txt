dangerously high temperatures that have already proven deadly in multiple states are expanding as far east as the northeast as they also threaten ocean ecosystems and fuel destructive wildfires that emit harmful particulates
more than million people from california to massachusetts were under some kind of heat alert wednesday as extreme temperatures spread across the country
over the next seven days of the population will experience temperatures degrees or higher
the southern tier of the us has been baking for weeks with places like phoenix miami and el paso texas continuing to smash record long extreme heat streaks tuesday
now it s the midwest mid atlantic and northeast s turn
temperatures are forecast to top degrees in places like kansas city and st
louis through friday
as the heat builds into the mid atlantic and northeast by thursday and friday highs in the upper s could break daily records in places like washington dc philadelphia and new york
high humidity will drive up the heat index there to over degrees fahrenheit
the stifling forecast has pushed connecticut s governor to activate the state s extreme hot weather protocol on wednesday to provide cooling centers for vulnerable residents
millions of people in these cities are exposed to more intense heat new report shows
we ve experienced a pretty warm summer so far but it s expected to get particularly hot this week including during the evening hours connecticut gov
ned lamont said
and the heat has been affecting everyone last month was the hottest june on record dating back to according to a climate report by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration
globally june set a record for the highest monthly sea surface temperature anomaly of any month in noaa s year record the agency said
june heat was not limited to the ocean surface the southern hemisphere had its warmest june on record and the northern hemisphere tied for its warmest june
scientists agree that human induced climate change is the main culprit causing record high temperatures which have led to hospitalizations and deaths in the us
additionally wildfires burning in canada and us have been exacerbated by the unrelenting heat tanking the air quality for many in both countries
the exceptional heat isn t confined to land either
ocean temperatures around florida are so high that experts reported severe coral bleaching and a die off at some reefs which could worsen if the extreme warmth persists
and before temperatures begin to lessen in some places next week here are some of the impacts it had on communities in recent weeks
dozens of people across arizona and nevada have died this year from the physical impacts of extreme heat
in arizona s maricopa county home to phoenix deaths have been reported to be heat related so far this year as of tuesday the county said in a weekly report
another deaths are under investigation for whether heat was a cause
extreme heat in arizona increased hospitalizations to pandemic levels at one medical center
meanwhile clark county in nevada reported at least heat related deaths the county s coroner told cnn on tuesday
las vegas located in clark county experienced temperatures above degrees for consecutive days the last of which was monday
extreme heat is the leading cause of weather related deaths in the us killing more people than hurricanes or tornadoes
and it also leads to illnesses
last week at least hospital visits in arizona were related to heat related complications the state department of health services said
fire departments and emergency medical service ems providers have reported treating an increasing number of patients for heat related illness too
these incidents are only the tip of the iceberg
we urge arizonans to take this extreme heat extremely seriously the department said in a statement tuesday
i chose to hike alone without water and i did not check the weather
when i returned i was clammy shaking ash gray had a splitting headache and felt nauseous
it took over a day to recover
always have plenty of water https t co boz yzal nmwx pic twitter com ppnhqp osr
making matters worse five people are suspected to have died since june from heat related causes in national parks more than an average entire year park service news releases and preliminary national park service data provided to cnn show
no other year had five heat related deaths by july according to park mortality data dating to
a wildfire in southern oregon fueled by the heat and strong winds destroyed dozens of homes and outbuildings and also knocked out internet and services in one county
the so called golden fire burned through homes and outbuildings as it grew to more than acres around miles north of bonanza oregon since july
the fire also knocked down more than power poles blacking out internet and services in lake county oregon according to a news release from the lake county sheriff s office
nearby klamath county oregon was handling calls in the meantime
the fire was one of several also degrading air quality across the country
as of tuesday there were nine wildfires in each of arizona and new mexico according to the national interagency fire center
smoke from hundreds of canadian wildfires blankets northern us cities with air pollution
also smoke from hundreds of wildfires burning across canada continued to waft south tanking air quality and polluting air in chicago and detroit
both cities were among the top cities with the worst air quality in the world according to iqair with chicago ranking fifth and detroit ninth as of early wednesday morning
today air quality in the city of detroit will be unhealthy for sensitive groups aqi orange range the detroit health department said tuesday
the air quality is being impacted by the presence of fine particulate matter pm
in addition to the poor air quality detroit is also facing extreme heat this week when some areas are expected to feel as hot as degrees thursday and friday according to the city s national weather service
very hot and muggy conditions are likely later this week with heat index values approaching degrees the weather service said on twitter
the consequences of dangerously high temperatures have stretched beyond land
the record breaking heatwave led to surging water temperatures off florida s coast where multiple reefs around the keys area are currently completely bleached or dead
the mass bleaching event unfolded in two weeks according to coral experts who said they expect the complete mortality of the bleached reefs in just a week
because it is extremely sensitive to temperature changes experiencing too much heat for too long causes coral to bleach and turn white as they expel their algal food source and slowly starve to death
the water is typically in mid s in the region but experts have recorded degree temperatures according to cynthia lewis who heads the keys marine laboratory at the florida institute of oceanography
florida ocean temps surge to degrees as mass coral bleaching event is found in some reefs
it is very alarming she said in a news release
teams from the university of south florida and the florida institute of oceanography keys marine laboratory conducted a rescue mission for more than corals by harvesting them from at risk sites and bringing them into a temperature controlled laboratory
sweltering temperatures are also posing a risk to the atlantic meridional overturning current a vital system of ocean currents which includes the gulf stream
a study published tuesday in the journal nature found the current may collapse around the middle of the century or as early as
the amoc is a complex tangle of currents that works like a giant global conveyor belt
it transports warm water from the tropics toward the north atlantic where the water cools becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean before spreading southwards
it plays a crucial role in the climate system helping regulate global weather patterns
its collapse would have significant implications including much more extreme winters and sea level rises affecting parts of europe and the us as well as a shifting of the monsoon in the tropics
scientists uninvolved with the study told cnn the exact tipping point for the critical system is uncertain and that measurements of the currents have so far showed little trend or change
but they agreed these results are alarming and provide new evidence that the tipping point could occur sooner than previously thought
