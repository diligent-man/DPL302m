water levels on the mississippi river are nearing historic lows for the second consecutive year triggering a drinking water emergency in louisiana as ocean water flows upstream unimpeded by the river s uncharacteristically weak flow
with no substantial rain in the immediate forecast levels are expected to drop to even more dire levels in the coming weeks leading louisiana s governor to warn water woes there could stretch into january
water gauges across a nearly mile expanse of the mississippi river from the mouth of the ohio river to jackson mississippi are at or below a critical level according to data from noaa and the us geological survey signaling widespread disruption to residents and industry along the river
all the gauges in the memphis area are within the top five lowest levels on record said katie dedeaux a hydrologist for the national weather service in memphis
water levels for some gauges from southern missouri to central mississippi are expected to dip even further and fall below record levels by the middle of october
when will saltwater arrive in new orleans here s what to know
lower mississippi river water levels are forecast to continue to drop through at least mid to late october according to dedeaux
we re going to need a pretty significant period of wet weather across the basin dedeaux told cnn noting that this isn t a situation where one heavy rain event can fix the problem
it s not going to be an overnight thing
this could spell trouble for the tens of thousands of people in four louisiana parishes including new orleans whose water is threatened by salty ocean water pushing northward into water systems
in order to push the saltwater back inches of precipitation across the entire mississippi valley is needed according col
cullen jones commander of the army corps new orleans office relief that may not arrive until this winter
water levels on the mississippi river began to plummet in early september well ahead of the october drop last year
the consecutive nature of these droughts has prevented the river from being able to recharge dedeaux told cnn
meaningful rainfall was hard to come by for large swaths of the mississippi river watershed over the summer due to a seemingly never ending series of heat domes which fueled record breaking temperatures and directed wet weather away from the southern and central us
heat fueled exceptional drought which is the highest level defined by the us drought monitor is in place across nearly one fifth of the lower mississippi river region the second largest area recorded there since
this summer was the hottest and the third driest on record for louisiana where over of the state is in severe or exceptional drought
portions of minnesota wisconsin iowa mississippi and louisiana ended the summer with a rainfall deficit of to inches under what typically falls during the course of the season according to data from noaa
some parts of louisiana even missed out on or more inches of typical rainfall over the summer
the rainfall deficit at the southern end of the watershed can also be tied back in part to a lack of hurricane activity impacting the region the past two hurricane seasons
no tropical systems which can dump large quantities of rain have made landfall in louisiana or mississippi over the last two years
so even though october and november are typically when the mississippi river is at its lowest levels all of these factors fueled significant rainfall deficits across the mississippi watershed which sent levels dramatically lower than normal alexis highman of the lower mississippi river forecast center told cnn
there are signs of relief in the longterm
a drought outlook recently released by noaa s climate prediction center forecasts improvement but not elimination of drought conditions by the end of the year across the mississippi valley
it also shows above normal precipitation chances over the next three months across the south
an ongoing el ni o will partly drive this potential drought relief
el ni o winters often feature increases in precipitation across the south
but an el ni o winter may be a double edged sword as portions of the northern plains and midwest tend to say drier than average
drier conditions may affect rivers which flow into the mississippi river like the missouri and the ohio limiting the amount of water feeding into the mississippi as a whole
sixty percent of the water that flows into the lower mississippi river comes from the ohio river while the other percent comes from the upper mississippi river dedeaux told cnn
