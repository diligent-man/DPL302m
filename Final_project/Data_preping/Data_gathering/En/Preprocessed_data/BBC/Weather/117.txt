when a hurricane undergoes rapid intensification its maximum sustained winds increase by at least mph in hours or less driving up the danger the storm could pose to life and property
rapid intensification is associated with a sharp increase in intensity in a short amount of time and consequently the threat posed by the storm significantly increases said phil klotzbach a research scientist in the department of atmospheric science at colorado state university
hurricane categories and other terminology explained
most major hurricanes category or higher undergo rapid intensification at some point a study shows
of such storms in the north atlantic since fit the bill said klotzbach a study coauthor
more and more hurricanes over the period underwent extreme rapid intensification with at least a mph increase in maximum sustained winds over hours the study found
while the uptick may be simply due to better observations we think that most of the trend is actually real klotzbach said noting wind speed forecasting has improved in recent years
because heat helps fuel storms higher sea surface temperatures and high ocean heat content play huge roles in rapid intensification
so as the climate crisis forces up ocean temperatures rapid intensification becomes more likely pushing storms to explode at a rapid pace into deadly hurricanes scientists say
scientists are confident hurricanes are on track to get increasingly stronger with rising mean global temperatures meaning more rapid intensification along with increased rainfall the intergovernmental panel on climate change report from shows
hurricane ian in went from having roughly mph to mph maximum sustained winds in hours leading to higher storm surge and more damage
it weakened slightly before making landfall as a monster storm devastating florida s coast
hurricane ida in went through a remarkable mph jump in maximum sustained winds in just hours before hitting louisiana as a category hurricane
it tied the record with laura in as the strongest hurricane to make landfall in the state
hurricane dorian in was the second strongest atlantic hurricane of modern times and reached the highest category on the saffir simpson hurricane wind scale
it underwent rapid intensification twice before becoming the strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the bahamas where it lingered for days and left catastrophic damage
