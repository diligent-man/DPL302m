editor s note cnn s continuing coverage of hurricane lee and friday s forecast can be found here
hurricane lee has strengthened into a major category storm packing maximum sustained wind speeds of mph as it spins over the atlantic well east of the caribbean the national hurricane center said in an p m
et advisory thursday
lee which was a category storm earlier thursday has been intensifying with exceptional speed in the warm waters of the atlantic ocean doubling its wind speeds in the last hours
the hurricane was located about miles east of the northern leeward islands the hurricane center said in the p m
advisory
the storm will likely reach its peak intensity by this weekend and is still expected to be a dangerous hurricane over the southwestern atlantic early next week though it s too soon to know whether this system will directly impact the us mainland
dangerous surf and rip currents will spread across the northern caribbean on friday and begin affecting the united states on sunday the center said
there is increasing confidence that the center of lee will pass to the north of the leeward islands the virgin islands and puerto rico this weekend and into early next week
tropical storm conditions life threatening surf and rip currents could occur on some of these islands over the weekend
also thursday a tropical depression in the eastern atlantic strengthened into tropical storm margot just a few hundred miles west of the cabo verde islands the center said
margot currently has winds of mph and steady strengthening is expected the center is forecasting margot to become a hurricane over the weekend
the forecast track shows the storm turning to the north over the central atlantic early next week but it is not expected to threaten any land areas as of thursday
computer model trends for lee have shown the hurricane taking a turn to the north early next week
but exactly when that turn occurs and how far west lee will manage to track by then will play a huge role in how close it gets to the us
here s what will steer the storm and two potential scenarios meteorologists are watching for how the us threat could play out
several steering factors at the surface and upper levels of the atmosphere will determine how close lee will get to the east coast
an area of high pressure over the atlantic known as the bermuda high will have a major influence in how quickly lee turns
the bermuda high is expected to remain very strong into the weekend which will keep lee on its current west northwestward track and slow it down a bit
as the high pressure weakens next week it will allow lee to start moving northward
once that turn to the north occurs the position of the jet stream strong upper level winds that can change the direction of a hurricane s path will influence how closely lee is steered to the us
scenario out to sea
lee could make a quick turn to the north early next week if high pressure weakens significantly
if the jet stream sets up along the east coast it will act as a barrier that prevents lee from approaching the coast
this scenario would keep lee farther away from the us coast but could bring the storm closer to bermuda
scenario close to east coast
lee could make a slower turn to the north because the high pressure remains robust and the jet stream sets up farther inland over the eastern us
this scenario would leave portions of the east coast mainly north of the carolinas vulnerable to a much closer approach from lee
all these factors have yet to come into focus and the hurricane is still at least seven days from being a threat to the east coast
any potential us impact will become more clear as the lee moves west in the coming days
