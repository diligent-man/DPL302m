A perfect storm is unfolding this summer one climate scientist told CNN as atmospheric ingredients combine to create deadly flooding in the Northeast US and record-breaking heat in the Southwest US and around the world
Deadly flooding inundated parts of the Northeast trapping people in their homes and killing at least one woman who was swept away by the fast-moving water
Rivers in Vermont rose quickly in the torrential rain on Monday to levels not seen since Hurricane Irene in
On Sunday more than inches of rain fell at West Point New York in just six hours — a -year rainfall event for the area according to a CNN analysis of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
A -year rainfall event is one that is so intense it only happens on average once every years
The climate crisis is stacking the deck in favor of more intense weather events like the heavy rain and flooding in the Northeast said Michael E
Mann a climate scientist and distinguished professor at the University of Pennsylvania
Trapped drivers swam out of their cars
A woman died after being swept away by floodwaters
What to know about the heavy rainfall hitting the Northeast
It’s going to happen — rainfall flooding events are going to happen Mann told CNN
What climate change is doing is it’s supercharging them so when you get one of those weather systems that’s producing large amounts of rainfall you get more rainfall
There’s another more surprising way that the climate crisis could be driving these extreme rainfall events Mann said and it’s something on the forefront of climate research The jet stream could be getting stuck in positions that prolong these kinds of extreme events
The jet stream is the fast-moving river of air high in the atmosphere that ushers weather systems across the globe
Importantly it’s fueled by the extreme difference in temperature between the equator and the poles
But the planet is not warming equally in all locations Mann explained
The Arctic is warming much faster than the Lower for example which reduces the temperature difference from the equator to the pole
Scientists suspect that this decrease in temperature difference is changing how the jet stream behaves
The jet stream basically stalls and those weather patterns remain in place — those high and low pressure centers remain in place Mann said
And we’re seeing more of these sort of stuck wavy jet stream patterns that are associated with these very persistent weather extremes whether it’s the heat drought wildfire or the flooding events
As the Northeast is inundated with flooding rain dangerous heat is threatening other parts of the world
Temperatures are soaring in the Southwest this week where Phoenix could break its record for consecutive number of days above degrees
Last week the planet’s average daily temperature climbed to record levels in data tracked by two climate agencies in the US and Europe
Climate scientists told CNN that the global temperatures were likely the highest in at least years
Global heat in 'uncharted territory' as scientists warn could be the hottest year on record
Meanwhile the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service found that last month was the hottest June by a substantial margin above the previous record which was set in
Given the exceptional heat scientists are concerned that could be the hottest year on record
Mann said that El Niño is adding extra heat extra fuel to the fire El Niño which is a warm phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean is combining with the climate crisis and what you get is new record levels of heat at the planetary scale
But Mann said without the climate crisis which is caused by burning fossil fuels we simply wouldn’t be seeing these extreme events
The steady warming combined with an El Niño extreme weather events related to those changing jet stream conditions it all comes together if you will in a perfect storm of consequences which translates to truly devastating and deadly weather extremes that we’re dealing with here right now
