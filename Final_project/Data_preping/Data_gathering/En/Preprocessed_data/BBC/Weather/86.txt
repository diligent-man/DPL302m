Once a tropical storm strengthens into a hurricane it earns a category designation on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale through
Why coastal communities should fear storm surge
Knowing about each category can help predict what damage an incoming storm may inflict and how best to prepare
The categories are defined by wind speed with a storm of Category or considered a major hurricane And damage is exponential as wind speed increases meaning a strong Category storm could do up to times as much damage as a weak Category storm
But it s not always as simple as ticking up from to
Hurricanes carry many risks not adequately conveyed by the wind speed based scale including
Storm surge when winds push water onto shore which accounted for about half of hurricane fatalities between and according to a report in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society
Rainfall induced flooding and mudslides which made up about a quarter of such deaths the report shows
A storm s forward speed Slower storms are more destructive with strong gusts or rainstorms that pound the same areas for hours or days
Tornadoes which can spawn by the dozen from any hurricane
Still the National Hurricane Center uses categories set by sustained wind speed to estimate possible property damage from hurricanes Here s what s expected in each
Sustained winds are enough to blow shingles off roofs and damage gutters and vinyl siding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said
These winds also can uproot trees and bring down branches causing power outages and more property damage They can damage power lines directly too
Hurricane Nicole a Category storm made landfall in November along Florida s East Coast and impacted places still then recovering from Hurricane Ian less than two months earlier Nicole caused significant beach erosion and caused more than billion in damages according to NOAA
Sustained winds could cause as much as times the damage as those of a Category storm including extensive damage to a home s roof and siding
Numerous trees and power lines will most likely be damaged blocking roads damaging property and knocking out power for days if not weeks
Hurricane Delta struck Louisiana s coast in October with winds of mph and made landfall just miles east of where Hurricane Laura had come ashore just six weeks earlier Delta blew away many tarps on roofs damaged by Laura and did extensive damage to trees homes and businesses It also dumped more than a foot of rain across South Louisiana creating prolonged flooding
Now in major hurricane territory wind damage is much more widespread Well built homes and other buildings could suffer major damage and roofs will sustain heavy damage Numerous trees will be damaged or uprooted
Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes NOAA said
Hurricane Katrina was a Category storm that struck during the busy Atlantic hurricane season It first made landfall along the Florida coast at Category strength before rapidly intensifying in the Gulf of Mexico to Category It weakened before making landfall in southeast Louisiana as a Category storm
Storm surge was estimated at close to feet along the Mississippi Alabama border and estimated winds reached as high as mph near Grand Isle Louisiana Levee breaches sent water flooding into much of New Orleans forcing people onto rooftops for rescue Katrina killed more than people left as many as households displaced for at least a month and became the most costly storm on record according to NOAA
Catastrophic damage can result from these winds Well built homes will be heavily damaged with most of the roof blown away Trees and power lines will be down Water and power services could be out for months with the hardest hit places uninhabitable for weeks
Hurricane Ian made landfall in September along the southwest Florida coast as a Category storm It killed people and became the costliest storm on record in Florida Its enormous size and snail s pace made it exceedingly destructive with mph winds that battered coastal communities for hours
Ian brought record storm surge to Fort Myers and Naples estimated at to feet NOAA said For days after landfall the storm dumped unprecedented volumes of rain across Florida triggering tremendous river flooding in the weeks that followed
These are the most powerful storms on Earth Most well built homes will be destroyed many stripped to the foundation Power outages could last for months and the areas hardest hit could be uninhabitable for months
Hurricane Andrew in August was one of the worst storms to ever hit the United States devastating a whole region after it made landfall near Homestead Florida Andrew grew from a Category storm to a Category storm in just hours with maximum winds near Homestead around mph according to NOAA
At the time Andrew was the costliest and most damaging hurricane ever to hit the United States the National Weather Service said
