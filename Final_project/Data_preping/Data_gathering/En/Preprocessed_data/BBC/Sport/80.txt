kamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers having finished yet another grueling working day when he and he says a few others were arrested this august
without explanation the year old says he was put into a vehicle and for the next week kept in a qatari jail the location and name of which he does not know
when they arrested me i couldn t say anything not a single word as i was so scared he told cnn sport speaking at home in southern nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago
kamal cnn has changed the names of the nepali workers to protect them from retaliation is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in qatar a country that will this month host one of sport s greatest most lucrative spectacles the world cup a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully choreographed celebrations
it will be a historic event the first world cup to be held in the middle east but one also mired in controversy
much of the build up to this tournament has been on more sober matters that of human rights from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in qatar to lgbtq and women s rights
kamal says he has yet to be paid the qatari riyal bonus around he says he is entitled to from his previous employers nor riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work
i wasn t told why i was being arrested
people are just standing there some are walking with their grocery sic some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products they just arrest you he adds before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak arabic
describing the conditions in the cell he shared with other nepali migrant workers he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs
inside the jail there were people from sri lanka kerala india pakistan sudan nepal african philippines
there were around units
in one jail there were around people
around people per room he says
when they take you to the jail they don t give you a room right away
they keep you in a veranda
after a day or two once a room is empty they keep people from one country in one room
using a smuggled phone he spoke to friends one of whom he says brought his belongings including his passport to the jail though he says he was sent home after the nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail
cnn has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response
when they put me on the flight i started thinking why are they sending workers back all of a sudden it s not one two people they are sending workers on one flight he says
some workers who were just roaming outside wearing work dress were sent back
they don t even allow you to collect your clothes
they just send you back in the cloth you are wearing
kamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job which is illegal under qatar s labour law and allows authorities to cancel a worker s work permit
he says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight hour days a week
qatar has a day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented
he says he received paperwork upon his arrest which amnesty international says would likely have explained why he was being detained but as it was in arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided
a qatari government official told cnn in a statement any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue
action is only taken in very specific cases such as if an individual participates in violence
the official added that of all eligible workers were covered by qatar s wage protection system established in which ensures wages are paid in full and on time further work was being done to strengthen the system the official said
with the opening match just days away on the pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world s richest countries per capita
some would never return home
none of the three nepali workers cnn spoke to were richer for their experience
indeed they are in debt and full of melancholy
the guardian reported last year that south asian migrant workers have died in qatar since the country was awarded the world cup in most of whom were involved in low wage dangerous labor often undertaken in extreme heat
the report did not connect all deaths with world cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by cnn
hassan al thawadi the man in charge of leading qatar s preparations told cnn s becky anderson that the guardian s figure was a sensational headline that was misleading and that the report lacked context
a government official told cnn there had been three work related deaths on stadiums and non work related deaths
in a statement the official said the guardian s figures were inaccurate and wildly misleading
the figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a year period and attributes it to the world cup the official said
this is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness old age and traffic accidents
it also fails to recognize that only of foreign workers in qatar are employed on construction sites
it has been widely reported that qatar has spent billion leading up to the tournament which would make it the most expensive world cup in history though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction
a spokesperson for the supreme committee for delivery legacy sc which since its formation in has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the world cup told cnn that the tournament budget was billion without expanding on what that cost covered
eight new stadiums rose from the desert and the gulf state expanded its airport constructed new hotels rail and highways
all would have been constructed by migrant workers who according to amnesty international account for of the workforce in a near three million population
since migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages forced labor long hours in hot weather employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country s sponsorship system human rights organizations have found
however the health safety and dignity of all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast a statement from the sc read
our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards health and safety regulations grievance mechanisms healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers
while the journey is on going we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised
a legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair sustainable and lasting labour reforms
last year in an interview with cnn sport anchor amanda davies fifa president gianni infantino said that while more needs to be done progress had been made
i ve seen the great evolution that has happened in qatar which was recognized i mean not by fifa but by labor unions around the world by international organizations said infantino
we are unusually writing about a world cup in november because the competition had to be moved from its usual june july slot to qatar s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country s summer months temperatures can reach around degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit in june that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players
hari is years old and like many of his compatriots left nepal for qatar as his family he was one of five siblings with just his father at home desperately needed money primarily to eat
since nepal s government mandated minimum wage has been set at a month according to minimum wage org
he says that his monthly wage in qatar was rial a month
after moving to qatar in he worked in four places during his four year stay at a supermarket a hotel and airport but the most difficult job he says was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings six to seven stories above in overbearing heat plus lay pipelines in deep pits
it was too hot he tells cnn
the foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot
the foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay
i had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top
it was very difficult going up through the scaffolding
in the pipeline work there were meters deep pits we had to lay the stones and concrete it was difficult due to the heat
it was difficult to breathe
we had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water
it never happened to me but i saw some workers fainting at work
i saw one bengali one nepali two to three people faint while working
they took the bengali to medical services
i m not sure what happened to him
during his time in qatar government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between a m
and p m
from june to august
he said one company he worked for followed these rules
he added at some places they didn t have water
some places they didn t provide us water on time
at some places we used to go to houses nearby asking for water
working long hours in extreme heat has some non governmental organizations believe caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in qatar
in research published in the cardiology journal exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than nepali workers between and and heat exposure found a strong correlation between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months
the government official told cnn that there had been a consistent decline in the mortality rate of migrant workers including a decline in heat stress disorders thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation
qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account the government official added
systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world
natasha iskander professor of urban planning and public service at new york university tells cnn that heat can kill in ways that are confusing and unclear
fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure
sometimes heat kills through the body amplifying manageable and often silent conditions like diabetes and hypertension and turning them into sudden killers she explains
as a result qatar in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat
determining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder she says because many injuries may not become apparent until years later when migrants have returned home and young men find that their kidneys no longer function that they suffer from chronic kidney disease or that their hearts have begun to fail displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating
heat does not typically injure on its own she adds
workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on qatari worksites
the long hours physically intense work the forced overtime the abusive conditions the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat
additionally conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat s power to harm things like poor sleep insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat
in qatar the employer housed workers in labor camps and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas where living accommodations were terrible
according to amnesty international qatari authorities have not investigated thousands of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions that these deaths are not being recorded as work related prevents families from receiving compensation the advocacy group states
in its statement the sc said that its commitment to publicly disclose non work related deaths went beyond the requirements of the uk s health and safety executive reporting of injuries diseases and dangerous occurrences regulations riddor which defines and provides classification for how to document work related and non work related incidents
the statement added the sc investigates all non work related deaths and work related fatalities in line with our incident investigation procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented
this process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident
amnesty international s ella knight told cnn sport that her organization would continue to push qatar to thoroughly investigate deaths of migrant workers including past deaths to ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives
barun ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of nepali migrants working abroad
he tells cnn that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones deaths
families send out healthy young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping he says
in a separate interview he told cnn last year the qatar world cup is really the bloody cup the blood of migrant workers
last year qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited replacing legislation introduced in and additionally putting into law that all work must stop if the wet bulb globe temperature wbgt raises beyond c f in a particular workplace the regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers as well as mandatory risk assessments
we recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in qatar a qatari government official said
in may qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress
companies are expected to adopt flexible self monitored working hours where possible adjust shift rotations enforce regular breaks provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the ministry of labour
every summer qatar s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed the official added
between june and september work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules
iskander said a heat point of c wbgt was already dangerous
working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body she explained
the regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress
anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self pace
knight adds the fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection
for the majority of his time in qatar hari said he felt sad
he would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country
but he had paid nepali rupees to a nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move
he was also told he says by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay to riyal to buy himself out of his contract
his friends he said counseled him as he continued to work long lonely days for hari says not enough money to live and save for his family
amnesty international says many migrants pay high fees to unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to qatar
now he is a father of two and work is plowing fields in nepal as a tractor driver but hari hopes one day to work abroad again his heart set on malaysia
i don t want my children to go through what i did
i want to build a house buy some land
that s what i am thinking
but let s see what god has planned he says
sunit has been back in nepal since august after working just eight months in qatar
he had expected to be there for two years but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them he says
he struggles to find work in nepal meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult
he had dreamed of watching world cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build
one of the stadiums the name of which he does not know was a minute walk from the hotel
we used to talk about it he says of the world cup
but we had to return and our dreams never came true
the stadium activities were visible from the hotel
we could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop
in helping construct the city center hotel the name of which he doesn t remember he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement weighing from to kilos on his shoulders up to to floors he says
the lift was rarely functional
some people couldn t carry it and dropped it halfway
if you don t finish your job you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day he says
the foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work
they used to threaten us saying we will not pay you for the day we said go ahead
we are humans we need to drink water
it was very hot
it used to take to two hours to get to the top
i used to get tired
i used to stop on the way
then proceed again slowly
yes the supervisors used to yell at us
but what could we do
he says he had paid an agent in nepal nepali rupees around before leaving for qatar
he says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two year contract but there have been no developments
he says the owners of the company he worked for in qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers
the company did not immediately respond to cnn s request for comment neither did it respond to questions from the business human rights centre an advocacy group about protests over unpaid wages
for a month he says he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food he borrowed to eat so he and his fellow workers called the police who brought food with them
the police came again after days and said we have arrested the company people
the police distributed food again he says
they told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home
i m extremely sad he adds
i mean it is what it is
nothing would change by regretting it
i get mad at the company but what can i do even if i had tried to fight back it would have been my loss
the sc said it has established what it claims is a first of its kind workers welfare forum which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and when companies failed to comply with the wwf it steps in demands better and alerts the authorities
since the sc said contractors had been demobilized contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted
we understand there is always room for improvement the statement added
qatar a peninsula smaller than connecticut and the smallest world cup host in history is set to host an estimated million fans over the month long tournament which begins on november
there are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors
the spotlight is no doubt on this gulf state as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago though qatari officials have previously strongly denied to cnn the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid
such attention has brought about reforms significantly dismantling the kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers employment and immigration status
in qatar migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer
but knight adds another aspect of the kafala system the criminal charge of absconding still exists and this along with other tools that are still available to employers means that fundamentally the power balance between workers and employers the imbalance remains great
knight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system lacks enforcement mechanisms while she also says employers can cancel a worker s id at a push of a button meaning they risk arrest and deportation
additionally labor committees intended to help workers are under resourced and lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them
ghimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is more show and tell
many workers who work in construction are untouched so there s still exploitation going on he tells cnn
qatar s government official told cnn work remained to be done but that systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world
over the last decade qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement
human rights watch s payupfifa campaign wants qatar and fifa to pay at least million an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the world cup to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament
families of workers who have died face uncertain futures hrw says especially children
those who survived and returned home cheated of wages or injured remain trapped in debt it says with dire consequences for their families
ghimire says compensation is key but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen
people are concerned about clothing brands and the meat they eat but what about mega events isn t it time we ask how this was possible he asks
everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated
players should know sponsors should know
would it be the same situation if it was european workers dying in qatar if it was argentinean workers would argentina be concerned about playing
because it s migrant workers from poor south asian countries they re invisible people
forced labor death of workers while making a world cup is unacceptable
as a football fan it makes me sad as a lawyer it makes me really disappointed
earlier this month qatar s labor minister ali bin samikh al marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund
a qatar government official said the country s workers support and insurance fund was effective in providing compensation for workers and their families with the fund reimbursing workers with more than million so far this year
in terms of the sc s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees as of december workers have received million with an additional million committed by contractors according to fifa
last month fifa s deputy secretary general alasdair bell said compensation is certainly something that we re interested in progressing
it has been widely reported that fifa has urged nations participating in the world cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off
fifa confirmed to cnn that a letter signed by fifa president gianni infantino and the governing body s secretary general fatma samoura was sent out on november to the nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents
however a number of european federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers
the motto for qatar s bid team in was expect amazing in many ways this year s world cup has replicated that maxim
as nyu s iskander says one of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the world cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it
they built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone including the engineers and designers until they were built
they performed acts of bravery that are unsung
they operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled
and yet their contribution to building the world cup is really rarely featured downplayed
they are represented generally speaking as exploited and oppressed
and it s true that they have been exploited and oppressed but they are also the master craftsmen that built this cup and they are enormously proud of what they have built
hosting this tournament has undoubtedly put qatar under the global spotlight
the question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built knowing the true cost of this billion dollar extravaganza
