there are many things from the evening in which she made history that claudia vasconcelos remembers well but years on and it s the atmosphere inside the stadium in guangzhou china that is etched most vividly in her mind
it was very surreal actually she recalls with a broad smile that never leaves her face
it was a packed stadium being in a stadium with that number of fans for women s football was a great joy
on november vasconcelos became the first female referee to officiate an official fifa world cup match taking charge of the women s world cup third place playoff between sweden and germany at the guangdong provincial stadium
her historic achievement wouldn t be recognized until sometime afterwards however as fifa was reluctant to brand the tournament as a world cup over fears it wouldn t be a success initially calling it the not quite so catchy st fifa world championship for women s football for the m m s cup
the world governing body s hesitancy to fully commit was also reflected in the referee uniforms worn by vasconcelos and her assistants none of which had fifa branding instead displaying only the emblems of their own federations
but the tournament quickly proved to be a roaring success and became a seminal moment for women s soccer in more ways than one
in total six female officials were appointed to games throughout the world cup including an all female team for the third place playoff comprised of brazil s vasconcelos zuo xiudi of china and new zealand s linda black
with the trio lined up in the center circle ahead of kick off vasconcelos made sure to savor the moment
she looked up at the swathes of fans in the stand in front of her and let the sights and sounds of the occasion wash over her
it was very beautiful the brazilian tells cnn sport
but she says she made sure not to forget why she was there
while the enormity of the occasion and her accomplishment remained at the forefront of her mind she above all wanted to give the best possible account of herself as a referee
once she crossed the white line and blew her whistle the emotion which vasconcelos say she felt with her whole body quickly passed
i ve always treated football refereeing in my games as if i were coming in to referee a world cup final she says
the excitement was cool before the ball rolled but once the game starts for me it s a game like any other
it s a game that i m going into with complete seriousness with all my attention all my focus
that unwavering focus is evident in the pre match photo taken of vasconcelos a steely determination etched on her face
though they start the match in the center of the pitch the last thing any good referee wants to be is the center of attention and vasconcelos and her assistants got through the match without a single moment of controversy
in the brazilian government pushed through a decree that said females would not be allowed to practice sports incompatible with the conditions of their nature
vasconcelos says she decided she wanted to become a referee in just four years after the ban on women playing soccer in brazil was lifted
that same year an organized women s league in her home city of rio de janeiro was launched
a year later she was officiating in the league s matches
vasconcelos was soon taking charge of men s youth matches and eventually senior men s matches and by the time the world cup rolled around she was the preeminent female official in brazil
initially vasconcelos recalls there was no indication that she or the other five female officials who had been called up to the tournament as lineswomen would get the chance to referee one of the matches
it wasn t until after the opening match in which she and an assistant from mexico took part that fifa informed her she would be leading an all female team for the third place playoff
it was a very big surprise she says sounding no less excited at the prospect over three decades later
we didn t expect this to happen
seated in the dressing room in the bowels of the guangdong provincial stadium everything vasconcelos had gone through to get to this historic occasion played over in her head
the journey had been far from easy
the now year old says she faced discrimination and a lack of support from within brazilian football which she says later contributed to her retirement from refereeing at the age of
i had my career very damaged by that she says highlighting a lack of opportunities to officiate the biggest teams
she also bemoaned bans she would receive for speaking out against local corruption in what she says was a deliberate attempt to stifle her career development
had the importance of the evening not sunk in yet for vasconcelos a member of fifa s referee committee made sure it did
he entered the dressing room to wish us a good game and asked me if i was aware that the game that match that my refereeing would be the future of female refereeing she recalls him telling her
it was a lot of pressure because you re going to enter the pitch and someone says to you look if you referee the game well women s refereeing will be successful
if you referee badly you might not have it
vasconcelos performance caught the eye of those at the top of the sport and it wasn t long before the adulation came flooding in
she stayed in china until the final where then fifa president jo o havelange also a brazilian and brazil great pel congratulated her in person
he pel watched the game and later on the day of the final he came to congratulate me and said that i had done an excellent job refereeing she recalled
that night helped accelerate the progress of female officials
at the world cup in sweden just four years later seven of the officials designated to the tournament were women and sweden s ingrid jonsson a lineswoman in the world cup final became the first female official chosen to referee a final
by all the officials chosen for the world cup in the usa were women
fast forward to this day and the likes of st phanie frappart or the now retired bibiana steinhaus have taken charge of men s games while premier league assistant sian massey ellis is a common sight in the english top flight
though the landscape of women s refereeing has changed markedly in the years since vasconcelos made history in china the trailblazer says the requirements needed to be a competent referee have remained the same
i think what matters is not the sex of the person you know what matters is competence
