Italian soccer club Napoli has said that it never intended to offend or make fun of star player Victor Osimhen after coming under fire for posting and then deleting a video of the striker missing a penalty on TikTok
In a statement posted on the club website on Thursday Napoli did not apologize to Nigeria international Osimhen the top scorer in Serie A last season but described him as an asset to the club

To avoid any potential exploitation of the matter SSC Napoli would like to explicitly state that the club never intended to offend or make fun of Victor Osimhen who is an asset to the club Napoli said in Thursday s statement
Over the course of the summer Napoli rejected all offers to sign the striker firm proof of the club s appreciation of him
On social media and TikTok particularly expressive language is used in a light hearted and playful manner In this case involving Victor there was no intention of mockery or derision
If Victor was in any way offended this was not at all in the club s intentions
The statement comes after Osimhen s agent Roberto Calenda threatened to take legal action against the club
In a post on X formerly Twitter on Tuesday Calenda said What happened today on Napoli s official profile on the TikTok platform is not acceptable
A video mocking Victor was first made public and then but now belatedly deleted A serious fact that causes very serious damage to the player and adds to the treatment that the boy is suffering in the last period between media trials and fake news
We reserve the right to take legal action and any useful initiative to protect Victor
In a video posted on X by Italian journalist Gennaro Del Vecchio Osimhen can be seen arriving at the team s hotel ahead of its win against Udinese on Wednesday where he greets team manager Giuseppe Santoro but appears to deliberately ignore several teammates on his way in
