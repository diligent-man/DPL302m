When hip hop obsessed American soldiers showed their Korean counterparts how to land headspins and windmills at US military bases in the s they probably didn t anticipate breakdancing s eventual explosion in the country
Upon reaching Korea s shores it was Korean American hip hop promoter John Jay Chon who having handed out VHS tapes of tutorials and competitions to Seoul s underground dance and club scenes was widely credited for igniting the boom
Breakdancing entered the Korean mainstream in the s through K pop trailblazers Seo Taiji Boys mesmeric music videos a modern phenomenon seemingly at odds with the country s conservative culture at the time
Then came the noughties widely seen as the country s breakdancing golden years when Korean crews won multiple titles at Battle of the Year one of the top international b boy competitions
As the first generation of K pop which similarly incorporated US hip hop conventions took over South Korea on its way to global domination the country s tourism board began investing millions of dollars into breakdancing competitions likely hoping it would lead to a similar K wave
The baggy jeans boomboxes and tattoos that had once captured pop culture in the United States breakdancing even featured at President Ronald Reagan s inauguration in experienced a similar lull in mainstream Korea by the mid s
But it never went away and is now in a resurgence that will next year take Korean b boys and b girls to the Olympics
This weekend breakdancing or breaking as it is known in official competitions will make its debut at the Asian Games in Hangzhou China ahead of its hotly anticipated introduction to the Summer Games in Paris next year
Breaking started by Black and Latino youths in the Bronx in the s is an assortment of dance styles such as locking popping and uprocking blended into one physically demanding expression Those in the industry prefer not to restrict breaking to a single category such as an art form or sport but refer to it as a culture
Rules and judging in a new era sporting setting are still in their infancy In Hangzhou two medals will be awarded in the men s and women s categories
Asia s best b boys and b girls will take turns to perform routines in one on one battles and are judged on six categories according to organizers perfomativity musicality personality creativity variety and technique
Though there is no official ranking by governing body World DanceSport Federation WDSF South Korea has long been among the world s best
Kim Heon woo also known as B boy Wing leads Team Korea s breaking team in Hangzhou The veteran from the legendary Jinjo Crew is a multiple world champion and Asian Games gold medal contender
Kim is hoping for a good result at the Games in what is South Korea s largest delegation in history at the quadrennial event There is added motivation after the country s emphatic success in fellow Asian Games debutant esports
There have been ups and downs but we always believed that the chance would come one day We ve worked hard for it Kim who has been breaking for more than two decades told CNN
Breaking had seen a glimmer of a return to its glory days through its exposure on popular dance survival TV reality show Street Woman Fighter in and Street Man Fighter in which Kim starred in
You can see the value of breaking as a sport I think this is an important beginning to the future Kim said
Hip hop and breaking began in the US Now each country is developing new types of dances to suit their own characteristics There s still some unfamiliarity with each other but there is more recognition and interest in our dances
While Kim has an eye on Paris the Asian Games is undeniably a milestone for what is probably the last batch of first generation Korean breakers
It s their last dance essentially said Kwon Jang ho a Seoul based journalist who is producing a documentary on the history of breaking in Korea
Kwon who started breaking in the United Kingdom in the early s before discovering the fledgling Korean scene in his university gap year had witnessed its domination for about years
Korea pretty much won everything you could think of in terms of global titles There was never really a single country that had dominated a scene like it had at the time It was crazy to see But since then no real new generation has emerged he said
With the Asian Games and Olympics coming up it s kind of like the last redemption of the golden generation Kwon added saying he hoped for a revival of the scene post Games
It would be quite the statement to say hey look we re still around We re still at the top of Asia It was kind of past its heyday but these guys are essentially trying for one last big moment of glory to inspire more generations and not just in Korea he said
That breaking has transcended into the sports realm can only mean good things said Chen Po Chun or Bboy Bojin the Asian Games breaking chair and WDSF s head of breaking division
The world we re living in now is moving so fast The result may not be to the liking of everyone involved but it s about learning said Chen who has been breaking for years
South Korea is really important alongside Japan and even China now All of these countries have contributed to different eras and have put impressive energy into breaking We should be grateful blessed and appreciative to have what it is we have now
At the Asian Games we will see all of this Legends young stars super athletes nobodies turning into somebodies all battling it out It s a good example for other Asian countries breaking will keep leveling up and make more people fall in love
