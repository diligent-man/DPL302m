rafael nadal believes long time rival novak djokovic is the greatest tennis player of all time and says there is nothing to discuss about the sport s goat debate
the serb recently won a record extending th grand slam singles title at the us open taking him two clear of nadal in second place
djokovic can also boast a record masters titles three ahead of nadal and the most weeks spent at world no
with weeks more than roger federer in second place
i believe that numbers are numbers and statistics are statistics and in that sense i think he has better numbers than mine and that is indisputable nadal told spanish outlet diario as
it is not beneath me nor do i have an ego big enough to try to disguise a reality that is not
this is the truth
the rest are tastes inspiration sensations that one player or the other may transmit to you that you may like one or the other more
i think that with respect to titles djokovic is the best in history and there is nothing to discuss in that
nadal added that some people could say he d had bad luck with injuries and djokovic has enjoyed better fortune but said philosophically that in some ways that is also part of the sport
i congratulate him for everything he is achieving and that does not cause me any type of frustration nadal said
i have said it when i was the one who won the most slams i said it when we were tied and i say it now that i am behind
i am not going to be the one who tries through a personal struggle to want to be what i am not
what is is and what is not is not
i say this very satisfied with everything i have done
the year old nadal hasn t played competitive tennis since injuring his hip in a second round defeat to mackenzie mcdonald in january s australian open and said in may after pulling out of the french open that next season will be his last on the tour
nadal says he remains pretty convinced that he will retire after next year but admits he can t say
if suddenly things are working very well physically i feel fine my head usually works normally
if i feel competitive and enjoy what i do why would i limit myself he said
nadal says he is currently either training or undergoing rehab twice a day to prepare for next season but is still playing very little tennis
the king of clay reiterated that he does not want his final year in tennis to just be a farewell tour and he intends to be competitive on the court but says he is very aware and has even assumed that this might not be the case
right now that s not in my head i m just putting myself in a situation where i can train and reach a competitive level to be able to play on the circuit he said
this is my current dream to go out on a tennis court and feel like i can play competitively
this is the first objective
afterwards you never know
if i m only good enough to go out on a court and feel that i m only going out to be minimally competitive to not be a disaster then i m not going to play much
i m going to play the few tournaments i feel like saying goodbye to
the worst case scenario is also something nadal has thought about with the spaniard admitting there is also the possibility that i may not recover and not play again
i hope that is not the case but one has to be realistic know the difficulty in which one finds oneself today and live it naturally
