for lisa wright an elite level diving judge from new zealand it was supposed to be the highlight of her career the chance to adjudicate at the sport s premier event at the olympics
but the scenes that unfolded after the men s meter platform final in tokyo last year darkened her olympic experience for some time wright says
they also led to an official complaint being lodged by diving new zealand and wright against zhou jihong a vice president of water sports governing body fina and one of the most influential figures in diving on the grounds of harassment and abuse
that was after zhou who has been dubbed the iron lady of chinese diving allegedly launched a verbal tirade at wright at the m platform event s conclusion for underscoring chinese divers
she was on poolside screaming at me and yelling at me it was definitely one of the most humiliating experiences of my life wright tells cnn sport
zhou was later ordered by a fina ethics panel to write a letter of apology to wright
however some members of the diving community view zhou s actions at the olympics as a flashpoint amid a wider pattern of conduct they believe is harmful to the sport
one of those who holds that belief is new zealander simon latimer a former diver and judge and now a member of fina s diving technical committee tdc
following the incident at the olympics latimer sent a whistleblower complaint to fina s executive director brent nowicki in december detailing zhou s alleged unethical behavior which he says stretches back several years and compromises the integrity of both diving and fina
this contains allegations that zhou has routinely coached chinese divers during major events including the tokyo olympics and has manipulated judging panels in order to benefit chinese athletes
zhou has not spoken publicly about these allegations
cnn has contacted the general administration of sport of china and the chinese swimming association for a response from zhou but has not received a response
latimer s complaint also focused on the events after the men s m platform final last year an incident he says he witnessed and describes as a personal outburst from zhou towards wright
part of making this complaint is to ensure that an incident like that never happens again latimer tells cnn sport
there s a lot of things to consider around athlete welfare but we also need to consider the welfare of officials
the final concluded with chinese divers cao yuan and yang jian winning gold and silver medals respectively and great britain s tom daley securing bronze
wright then approached zhou to offer her congratulations on china s success but says she was met with a barrage of verbal abuse and the allegation that she hadn t judged to an appropriate standard and had underscored chinese athletes
i just said i m sorry you feel that way and i left and ended up crying in the bathroom which was definitely not how you want to end your premier event of the olympics says wright
it was pretty traumatic for me to be honest especially given the fact that everyone knows that she s the vice president of fina
of some consolation for wright was the support she received from other diving officials who she says agreed with how she had scored athletes in the competition
moreover the event s independent assessor responsible for monitoring the scores given by the judging panel had agreed with her scoring on two occasions in which she gave a chinese diver lower scores compared to her peers
in a diving event judges on the panel award each dive a score ranging from zero to
every fina event has an assessor who watches replays of the dives checks for bias in the judging and evaluates the scores the judges are awarding
wright says she had no interest in making a personal complaint or retaliation against zhou but was also aware of what might happen if no investigation was launched by diving s authorities
she believes zhou would have the power and influence to exclude her from judging panels
in the end i think my biggest question was what am i in this sport for and what am i here for wright says
i felt that it was important that we do the best thing for the sport of diving that it remains fair because that s what i m here for as a judge that i rank those divers in the order that they should be ranked
in november the fina ethics panel ordered zhou to formally apologize to wright and diving new zealand for the incident
wright says she received the letter of apology appreciated it but didn t feel like it was something personal given zhou had been instructed to send it
the panel also ruled that only members of the tdc should be allowed on pool deck during competitions and that zhou s bureau liaison position traditionally tasked with taking the views of the tdc back to the fina bureau creates confusion conflict and discord and should be removed
in his whistleblower complaint which has been shared with cnn sport latimer alleges that zhou has provided coaching to chinese athletes at international diving events including the fina world championships and the diving world series as well as the olympics despite her roles requiring neutrality
it s absolutely unethical if you are up coaching divers from your own nation i don t see how you could be viewed as a neutral party says latimer
i also can t think of any other sport where you would have a vice president on pool deck coaching and having such an open interest in the proceedings
since the olympics video footage has emerged reportedly showing zhou coaching chinese divers at the games while another tdc member colleen huffman says she has witnessed zhou coaching at other international events
a lot of times she s very subtle about it but obviously at the olympics she wasn t subtle at all huffman tells cnn sport
for her to have her position and be a coach is a huge conflict of interest
it s one thing if she helps out at home with the national team but it s another thing if she s actively coaching an athlete at a major fina event when she s the bureau liaison
in a statement sent to cnn sport tdc member dominique philippopoulos said she has twice requested to coach divers from her native south africa at international events but on both occasions had her requests denied by fina officials on the grounds it was a conflict of interest
that s despite coming from a country where the sport of diving is small and the obstacles are many
according to philippopoulos the south african diving federation has limited resources and struggles to finance overseas trips and to cover the cost of coaches
a third allegation made by latimer in his whistleblower complaint is that zhou has deliberately manipulated judging panels in an apparent attempt to benefit chinese divers
two judges have confidentially advised me that they believe they are regularly disregarded to judge finals as punishment for not judging chinese divers as favourably as zhou jihong would like he wrote
one judge informed me that zhou jihong approached them at a world cup event in and asked why do you not like china
according to latimer zhou has substantial input when it comes to deciding which judges are chosen to officiate at competitions
he cites his own experience as a judge at the rio olympics ahead of which he says he had been awarded the highest cumulative evaluation score from assessors among international judges through
but he alleges in his whistleblower complaint that he fell out of favor as a judge during the olympics and was only reinstated for the men s platform final when members of the tdc commission convinced zhou jihong to reappoint him
what concerns me and some others is that judges appointed to finals aren t always the ones that appear to be assessed most highly says latimer
there s certainly a discrepancy in some judges with very high evaluations getting very few appointments
since making his whistleblower complaint latimer says he has received a response from fina saying the governing body won t look into the issues he raised as they were already considered during the previous complaint submitted by wright and diving new zealand
however allegations about zhou manipulating judging panels and coaching during events were not directly mentioned in the ethics panel s response to that initial complaint
these issues latimer says are being swept under the carpet by fina
in a statement sent to cnn fina said the reports regarding ms jihong zhou were fully investigated by an independent panel that heard from witnesses and reached a decision which is publicly available on the fina website
the independent panel concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that competition results were impacted in any way and to our knowledge no further formal allegations have been made beyond what has been previously decided by the independent panel
at all times fina s primary concern is the welfare of the aquatics community and ensuring the integrity of our competitions
latimer calls the incident between zhou and wright at the olympics a watershed moment for him the moment he decided to support the new zealand federation s complaint and then subsequently speak publicly about zhou s behavior and his concerns for the integrity of the sport
i m well aware that through this whistleblower process i could lose my position on the technical committee he says
we have elections in two months time in budapest at the world championships which start on june
but for me seeing this complaint through and getting some action is more important than maintaining my position on the committee although i would obviously like to stay on the committee and be part of the process to ensure this sort of behavior doesn t continue
allegations against zhou latimer says have been slow to emerge due to her influential status within the sport
the iron lady of chinese diving zhou became the country s first ever olympic gold medalist in the sport in
she went on to spearhead china s dominance in diving coaching the national team from to
today as well as being a fina vice president she is also the chair of the chinese swimming association
people are scared stiff they re petrified of rocking the boat and losing their position latimer says
huffman meanwhile says she fears for the future of the sport and the potential difficulty of attracting new judges given zhou s alleged behavior
people won t want to judge
they just won t she adds
we re already struggling to get judges particularly out of the south america region
all the judges from that area are aging out and the new people coming in they hear bad things about her how mean she is how intimidating she is
who wants to go experience that
as for wright she s looking forward to her next judging commitments with optimism undaunted by what happened at the olympics
she is in line to officiate at the world championships in june and the commonwealth games in birmingham england in july
zhou will likely be at the world championships but that doesn t cause her too much concern
what s in the past is in the past says wright
i really do believe that i choose forgiveness that i choose to just move on and continue doing what i love
