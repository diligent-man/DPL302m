kenya s kelvin kiptum broke the men s marathon world record in chicago on sunday becoming the first person to record a time faster than crossing the line in
running just the third competitive marathon of his career the year old shaved seconds off the previous world record which had belonged to his compatriot eliud kipchoge though it is still subject to the usual ratification procedure according to world athletics
he completed the race almost three and a half minutes ahead of anyone else kenya s benson kipruto finishing in second and belgium s bashi abdi in third
i knew i was coming for a course record but a world record i am so happy kiptum said afterwards according to world athleteics
a world record was not on my mind today but i knew one day i would be a world record holder
despite the magnitude of his achievement fast approaching kiptum still seemed to be running within his limits as he sprinted the towards the finishing line celebrating wildly before picking up a kenyan flag and embarking on a victory lap
he had remained outside world record pace at the halfway point with a time of but accelerated kilometers from the finish to seal his place in the history books
such a result has long seemed possible for kiptum who completed the fastest ever marathon debut race last december and set a course record in london in april with a time just seconds outside of kipchoge s then world record
meanwhile sifan hassan broke the women s course record in chicago with a time of the second fastest ever race as she made her us marathon debut
