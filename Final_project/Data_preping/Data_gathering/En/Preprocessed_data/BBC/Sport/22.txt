travis kelce has laughed off aaron rodgers new nickname for the kansas city chiefs tight end after the injured new york jets quarterback called him mr
pfizer during his weekly appearance on espn s the pat mcafee show
i thought it was pretty good the year old kelce told reporters on friday given the mustache he s currently sporting
with the mustache i look like someone named mr
pfizer
who knew i d get into vax wars with aaron rodgers man mr
pfizer against the johnson johnson family over there
the jets are owned by robert wood woody and christopher johnson members of the founding family of johnson johnson whose offerings include pharmaceutical and medical products
kelce who starred in a pfizer commercial promoting the covid vaccination added that he was comfortable with the name while advocating for the vaccine
i got it because keeping myself safe my family safe the people in this building kelce said
i stand by it
fully comfortable with him calling me mr
pfizer
after last week s sunday night football game between the chiefs and the jets rodgers was asked by mcafee about the loss and taylor swift attending the game at metlife stadium
there s some sort of moral victory out there that we hung with the champs and that our defense played well rodgers who tore his achilles tendon in his first game with his new team last month after seasons with the green bay packers told mcafee
pat mahomes didn t have a crazy game and mr
pfizer we shut him down
he didn t have a crazy impact game
obviously he had some yards and stuff but i felt like for the most part we played really tough on defense and played well the last three quarters
both mcafee and co host aj hawk laughed at the joke
mcafee asked rodgers again about the nickname to which the year old quarterback said he s doing commercials for pfizer so i m sure he s owning it
in while still with the green bay packers rodgers admitted to misleading the media about his covid vaccination status during an appearance on the joe rogan experience podcast
earlier that year rodgers said he had been immunized against the virus but a few months later he missed an nfl game due to covid protocols and confirmed he was unvaccinated
in the same media conference on friday kelce said that he and superstar musician swift were learning to live with all of the added attention that has come with the high profile speculation about the pair s relationship
we re learning with the paparazzi just taking photos from all over the place but at the same time it comes with it the two time super bowl champion said
you got a lot of people that care about taylor and for good reason
you know just gotta keep living learning and enjoying the moments
kelce did not go into detail about the pair s involvement
the eight time nfl pro bowler admitted has been good to him
i was on top of the world after the february s super bowl and right now even more on top of the world so it s fun kelce said
