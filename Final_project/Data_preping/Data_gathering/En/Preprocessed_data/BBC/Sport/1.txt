There are some weeks in the NFL when it’s hard to pick out the main storylines but then there are others where every game seems to have some big takeaway from it
Week was one of those weeks where all of Sunday’s game had intrigue talking points or controversies
The sight of the red of the San Francisco ers and the silver of the Dallas Cowboys on the same field is one which evokes strong memories of the heyday of one of the NFL’s fiercest rivalries
The two battled plenty through the s and s many times in the latter stages of the playoffs with the winner often going on to win the Super Bowl
After laying dormant for a while the rivalry has been renewed in recent years with two postseason meetings the ers have won both eliminating the Cowboys from the playoffs in the last two seasons
Buffalo Bills fans turn a pocket of London into a home from home but Jacksonville Jaguars spoil the party
When the two met on Sunday Night Football with both enjoying promising starts to the season a thrilling encounter was anticipated
It didn’t live up to the billing though with the ers continuing their unbeaten start to the season thanks to a blowout - victory over the Cowboys at Levi’s Stadium in California
Second-year quarterback Brock Purdy threw for four touchdowns a hat trick to tight end George Kittle while Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason ran for a touchdown apiece as the ers dominated their opponents from Texas
McCaffrey’s touchdown continues his excellent season as it was his th consecutive game with a score tied with Emmitt Smith for the fourth-longest streak in NFL history
He is one behind Hall of Fame running backs Lenny Moore OJ
Simpson and John Riggins who all scored in straight games
The ers defense turned the screw on the Cowboys offense at the same time intercepting Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott three times Oren Burks Tashaun Gipson and Fred Warner each picking off the -year-old
For the ers the win reinforced the team’s title credentials while it was another frustrating defeat for the Cowboys emphasizing the team’s up and down form
The Cowboys have enjoyed dominant victories like last week’s win against the New England Patriots but have also suffered damaging defeats to opponents they would be expected to beat such as to the Arizona Cardinals in Week
Didn’t see it coming Prescott said afterwards per the NFL
Put everything into this and got punched in the mouth
Called a couple weeks ago humbling against Arizona
But this may be the most humbling game I’ve ever been a part of
The New England Patriots have had a period of unmatched success under the stewardship of Bill Belichick
Six Super Bowl titles record number of wins and a legendary partnership with Tom Brady his status as the organization’s most important head coach is solidified
However with Brady gone and the team in a state of flux Belichick has struggled to replicate the level of excellence he once enjoyed
The season has been one to forget for the -year-old so far with the Patriots’ only win coming against an injury-ravaged New York Jets
Last week he suffered the heaviest defeat of his storied career in a - thumping by the Cowboys one which saw him bench quarterback Mac Jones midway through the game
It was a similar story this week too with the Patriots losing - at home to the New Orleans Saints a result which saw Jones benched once more and the New England fans voice their displeasure by booing throughout Sunday’s game
Jones threw two interceptions and lost a fumble as the team produced a season-low yards of total offense in what was the largest home loss Belichick has ever had as a head coach
Between a poor season last year some underwhelming performances to begin this campaign and reports of discontent emanating from Massachusetts questions have begun to percolate as to whether Belichick’s time with the Patriots is coming to an end
However he insisted after the loss to the Saints that he is focused on readdressing the team’s issues
Obviously it was a poor performance today here Belichick told reporters per the NFL
Plain and simple we’ve got to find a way to play and coach better than that
So let’s go start all over and get back on a better track than we’re on right now
Slow start and then just couldn’t could never really get the game under control
The Miami Dolphins are now - after Sunday’s emphatic - victory over the New York Giants a victory which saw the team continue its record opening on offense
Miami totaled yards against the Giants with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa throwing for yards Tyreek Hill catching of those and rookie running back De’Von Achane rushing for yards
Second-year head coach Mike McDaniel continued to show why he’s viewed as the NFL’s most creative young offensive mind
It means that the Dolphins have set a new record for the most offensive yards for a team through five weeks of the NFL season previously held by the St
That Rams team was given the nickname the Greatest Show on Turf and the Miami fans have crowned this year’s team with its own Florida spin on that famous nickname The Greatest Show on Surf
According to NFLcom Miami has total yards of offense this season which is over more than the second-place Eagles
It wasn’t a perfect outing for the Dolphins though with Tagovailoa throwing two interceptions including one which was returned for a -yard touchdown by the Giants’ Jason Pinnock
Tagovailoa does lead the NFL with passing yards and according to NFL Research is the first player in Dolphins history with at least passing yards in the team’s first five games of the season breaking Dan Marino’s franchise record of set in
When his team’s historic offensive achievement was put to him after the victory McDaniel had a simple response Mission accomplished
We had the whole time the whole off-season that was our goal was output after five games he told reporters with a smile
I mean I think it speaks to what the group is capable of and you’re honored to be in the same breath for any statistical reason
But when push comes to shove I think it speaks to a lot of deliberate hard work from a lot of human beings players coaches everyone
