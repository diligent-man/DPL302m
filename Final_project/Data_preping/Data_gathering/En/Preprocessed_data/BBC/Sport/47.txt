rory mcilroy has said that two heated rows with american caddies left him wanting to make it hurt for team usa as europe channeled rage into results to regain the ryder cup on sunday
the northern irishman dazzled in rome contributing a tournament best four points as the hosts held off a spirited fightback to run out winners and trigger euphoric celebrations on the th green at marco simone golf club
europe holds off late usa comeback to regain ryder cup
it was a stark contrast to scenes on the same spot some hours prior as tensions boiled over at the end of saturday s fourballs round
the catalyst was american patrick cantlay sinking a brilliant foot birdie putt to help clinch a crucial win for himself and wyndham clark over mcilroy and matt fitzpatrick
cantlay s heroics inflicted mcilroy s sole loss of the week and cut europe s lead to five points renewed hope for team usa sparking emphatic celebrations among onlooking teammates and crucially caddie joe lacava
mcilroy was incensed by lacava celebrating near him waving a hat in the air as he lined up his attempt to tie the match
after confronting lacava on the green hostilities reignited in the course s car park as the year old got into an angry exchange with another team usa caddie jim bones mackay
having been ushered into a car and taken to cool off in the hotel s cold plunge bath by teammate shane lowry mcilroy returned sunday to defeat sam burns in his singles match the disrespect of the previous evening fresh in european minds
i don t think it just motivated me it motivated the entire team we wanted to go out there and make it hurt for them mcilroy told bbc sport
i felt like i used it to my advantage and came out with a different level of focus and determination and in a way it gave the whole team a bit of fire in our bellies
walking off the th yesterday was the angriest i have been in my career
i said to the us guys i thought it was disgraceful what went on
i made that clear
but i needed to calm myself down
i could have let it bring me down the wrong path but i let it focus me
the four time major winner later said he had apologized to mackay who caddies for justin thomas via text on sunday morning
mcilroy explained that the caddie had been in the wrong place at the wrong time as he was the first american that the year old golf saw after leaving the locker room subsequently taking the brunt of his anger
mcilroy added that he had also been in conversation over text with lacava and is optimistic the rift will heal in time
everything will be fine mcilroy told reporters
it s a point of contention and it still hurts but time is a great healer and we ll all move on
according to nbc sports reporter steve sands lacava texted mcilroy s team late saturday night the message reading love you guys i have nothing but respect
cnn has reached out to team usa representatives regarding the two incidents
cantlay said he did not see the incident between lacava and mcilroy but praised his european counterpart for his fantastic performances in rome while us captain zach johnson insisted the issue between the duo had been diffused
i spoke with joe after and he said he talked to rory and it was all good
that s all i know johnson told reporters saturday
what i saw on was a phenomenal putt and a celebration by some of our guys
i saw passion and all of what s great in the ryder cup come out
the ryder cup is so full of emotion and passion that sometimes as humans we get ahead of ourselves both sides
and it s the beauty and the curse of it but i think the beauty far outweighs anything else
a leading performance in a dominant victory sealed an emotional personal redemption arc for mcilroy as tears of joy replaced tears of anguish from the ryder cup
the northern irishman had been inconsolable after losing comprehensively three times at whistling straits explaining that he should have done more to prevent europe s historically crushing defeat in an anguished tv interview
almost two years to the day an elated mcilroy bounced into team europe s winners conference following a career best performance and his fifth victory at his seventh ryder cup
everyone at the start of the week was talking about do you want to get revenge on the u s
team but this wasn t about revenge
this was about redemption and showing what we could do
this been a process we ve known months in advance basically what the game plan was how we were going to execute it and then it just comes down to everyone getting on the golf course and being themselves and playing the way they know that they can play
and this is the result which is amazing
