when it comes to formula one the sky is the limit for max verstappen
the dutchman became a three time world champion on saturday clinching the title after finishing second in the sprint race in doha at the qatar grand prix following his teammate sergio p rez s race ending crash the mexican was only other driver who could challenge verstappen to the championship
and red bull boss christian horner believes his driver despite being only is already among the very best in the history of the discipline
it s so difficult to judge different generations and different drivers that of course have not worked directly with you horner told cnn sport s amanda davies ahead of the qatar grand prix before saying that verstappen is in the same bracket as some of the greatest the sport has ever seen
i think that obviously includes lewis hamilton it includes michael schumacher it includes ayrton senna it includes all the other greats horner explained
i think you can now talk about him in the same sentence as those kind of icons of the sport
it is not just horner who believes verstappen is one of the greats to grace the pitlane
aston martin driver fernando alonso who is a two time world champion said verstappen looks set to be in a league of his own in the coming years
i think the next few years will be even better for max to be honest
he will keep adding championships so we will compare to michael schumacher even closer in the future alonso told reporters per reuters
red bull has won out of the races this f season
verstappen alone has won of these races with teammate p rez seeing the checkered flag first on two occasions
he s just had a stupendous year this year he has been in sensational form i think he s taken it to another level horner said of verstappen s remarkable season
there are not enough adjectives to describe what he has achieved this year
it has been absolutely phenomenal horner continued
since the very first round we have produced a great car the team has hit a new level as well and to have won all but one race this season is a record that we could never have dreamt about
horner believes that this red bull season will go down in history and be remembered alongside iconic years in motorsport such as mclaren s campaign
mclaren won out of the races that season
while red bull has already won the world constructors championship and verstappen has the drivers title wrapped up horner insists there is still more to be done as the season nears a conclusion
as far as we re concerned they the remaining races are all cup finals we are just going to go and attack every race in exactly the same manner that we have from the very first race in bahrain said horner
with five races after qatar the red bull boss made it clear he wants his team to end their historic season as strongly as possible particularly with p rez s ongoing battle for second in the drivers championship
not lose our focus not lose our attention to detail that we have had this year and really try and round out what has been a momentous season for us an historic season for us in arguably our most successful season ever in formula said horner
we want to sign it off in the most successful way that we possibly can horner said of the season s conclusion
that second position for checo p rez is something very very valuable to us something we have never achieved before having drivers first and second in the drivers world championship
that would be a new landmark for us if we could achieve that this year
