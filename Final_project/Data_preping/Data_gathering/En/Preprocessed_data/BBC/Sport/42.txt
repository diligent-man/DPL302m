no one expected jamie mocrazy to live after her fall
the chances of survival are slim when the brain starts bleeding in eight spots
her fatality report was written in the helicopter that took her to the vancouver hospital where she would spend the next few weeks of her life
family and friends waited hoping for a miracle but fearing the worst
she had been competing in freestyle skiing s world tour finals in canada when disaster struck
having successfully completed her first run ranking fourth in the standings she cranked up the difficulty for her second and final run
for the first woman to ever land a double flip at the x games in slopestyle ski an event where athletes race down a slope navigating obstacles and who had been ranked among the world s top two in her event for the three years prior to this competition finishing off the podium was not an option
you don t remember the fourth place finisher she tells cnn sport
concussions left her on the edge of insanity now this olympic wrestler is back and has titles in her sights
so she attempted a double flat off access backflip a trick she had been practicing for a week leading up to the finals
it was an off access trick and it had never been done before so i was pushing the limits again explains the now year old recalling her last memories of that april day in
but even though the trick was big that wasn t the only reason i went into a coma
mocrazy she changed her legal name from crane mauzy to her childhood nickname after marrying last may kissed her sister jeanee who was also competing albeit in the separate halfpipe discipline and set off for what was to be a career defining performance
instead what happened next changed her life
in fact it nearly killed her
she remembers nothing of what happened when her head whiplashed into the snow on landing from her flip
she went into a natural coma was intubated on the mountain and a battle began to save her life
for the first to hours there was a strong understanding that the injury might take jamie s life and they made that very apparent that statistically and from how she was presenting and the level of damage that it was likely she was not going to survive her sister jeanee tells cnn
during those days in vancouver mocrazy became one of the first people in north america to have catheters placed into her brain which allowed physicians to instantly monitor and modify her brain s oxygen and nutrient levels as well as her blood pressure
ten days after the accident against the odds the then year old opened her eyes just for a few seconds but long enough to add a flicker of light to the darkest of days
but even then as jeanee explains her sister was almost totally unconscious the entire time and the right side of her body was paralyzed
it took six weeks for the connecticut native to remember who she was and recognize her parents
she had a vague recollection of jeanee but not of her younger sister jilly
it was like being reborn like she was an infant basically she had to re grow from there says jeanee
mocrazy was flown to salt lake to be closer to her family which allowed her mom grace who had studied early childhood brain development to live with her in the hospital where she introduced what jeanee describes as wellness techniques to complement the medical care her daughter was receiving
it was the beginning what the former skier calls the second version of herself jamie recovery was slow often painful
there were physical and mental hurdles to overcome
we did everything together jeanee says of that summer even going to the bathroom she adds to ease the confusion her sister would suffer when alone
mocrazy had been intubated for such a lengthy period that it took two months for her to re learn to swallow
she had to have thickened liquids because the muscles had been pretty much destroyed by the breathing tube jeanee says
then mocrazy had to learn to talk again
at first she had to be taught how to express herself and then in jeanee s words how to cognitively articulate and speak like an intellectual adult which improved when she returned to college later graduating from westminster college in salt lake city with a degree in communications
her mom forced her to learn algebra again the argument being that her brain had to relearn its critical thinking skills
it was her mom who taught her how to read using kindergarten books and how to write
i basically did therapy or i slept mocrazy says adding that she would not be the person she is today were it not for her mother s care
and like a toddler learning to master climbing she would walk stairs every day up and down endlessly with the help of family and a gait belt which is placed around the waist so a caregiver can assist by holding the belt as she rebuilt muscle strength and muscle memory in an attempt to walk again
but in many respects the physical challenges she faced were the easiest
i was getting a lot of attention and applause wow jamie s walking again
jamie s riding a bike my cognition and my emotions were greatly affected and took a long time to heal she says
it took her five years to emotionally recover from the accident mocrazy says
nobody knew that nobody was paying attention nobody really understood she says
and emotions have been scientifically proven to be affected by traumatic brain injury
it affects your emotions and it also changes your life
these young female athletes died by suicide
they all had head injuries in common
that does not mean that your life has to be worse
i use the metaphor of climbing an alternative peak the views might be even more amazing
but you have to climb
and while you re climbing your life will be different and you will have different challenges and different opportunities
even when she was in a wheelchair her intention was to compete again
her goal was to live the only life she had known that of a high achieving young athlete with hopes of becoming an olympian
then during the first winter of her recovery reality struck
i felt old and washed up at she says
no vision no future
i felt done and going back to college definitely helped me set goals and be tested on things and actually start performing again and build a new life for myself
jeanee went to new zealand that winter for her first competitive event since her sister s accident
i just cried the whole competition i couldn t handle it at all she says and then when i came back that was the hardest part because even when it was all consuming beforehand once she woke up she was really happy and she was really fun and she was like a really fun child to hang out with
and we played toys and did our projects it was like parenting a year old but mostly like a fun year old
then in the winter she started feeling like she was fine but she wasn t fine and at that point she was more like the rebellious teenager
jeanee says her job during that period was keeping her older sister safe making sure she didn t take car keys because no matter how capable mocrazy felt the truth was she was unable to multitask
she could literally have just the one thought in her head
that was the harder part
she was really not emotionally healed yet but she physically was says jeanee
so the entire world treated her as if she was fine except for those of us who lived with her and knew she wasn t fine
undoubtedly life has changed for mocrazy since the accident
she is the same she says though some of her childhood traits have returned
i m just much more goofy but that s how i was as a child she says
i m still adventurous and still hard working and ambitious
i think a lot of my traits stayed the same
she has since returned to the mountain where she almost died to celebrate her marriage to the love of her life reggie an experience she describes as one of the most beautiful breathtaking emotional of my life
mocrazy is also skiing again though with caution
i still don t do tricks and i still don t compete she says adding that though her brain is now stronger she doesn t know what would happen were she to hit her head hard again
she says she feels completely recovered from the injury though life has since thrown more misfortune her way namely the death of her oldest sister amy from leukemia in who was one of the physicians who cared for her at vancouver general hospital
she saved me and i couldn t save her and that was really challenging she says
so i have gone back to therapy but it definitely is not because of my brain injury
her life goal is now to help others who have suffered traumatic brain injuries and raise awareness on recovery methods setting up the non profit organization mocrazy strong with jeanee and her mother for the purpose of changing the narrative and giving back
in march of this year mocrazy and her sister went to capitol hill to talk to legislators and show a recent short documentary entitled mocrazystrong that has been made about her recovery process one which was particularly family orientated she says
there are so many decisions she says her family made that would have changed the outcome that you see explaining as way of example that her mom would tape her stronger hand to make her use her weaker one
i understand how fortunate my recovery was in the factors that i had so much education in my family of caregivers she says
and the fact that i am a white privileged accomplished athlete with finances made a huge difference in my recovery
so my goal is to share that and save millions of lives
and we are starting to do that and that feels very rewarding to be able to take this story and save people with it
i feel completely healed
and something that really helps with my contentedness in life is that i feel like i have an alternative peak and i am seeing some amazing views and i m helping others
