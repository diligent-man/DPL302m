north carolina unc wide receiver devontez tez walker is now eligible to play following new information the school failed to provide previously the ncaa announced on thursday
it is unfortunate that unc failed to provide this important information previously ncaa president charlie baker and georgia president jere morehead the division i board of directors chair said in a statement
while we must be careful not to compromise a student athlete s right to privacy when it comes to sensitive issues we want to assure the division i membership and everyone watching how the new transfer rules are applied that this meets the new transfer waiver standards
ncaa complains of violent threats after controversial transfer decision
unc s behavior and decision to wage a public relations campaign is inappropriate and outside the bounds of the process unc s own staff supported
had the unc staff not behaved in this fashion and submitted this information weeks ago this entire unfortunate episode could have been avoided
unc disputes the ncaa claims
the school s director of athletics bubba cunningham said the governing body s claim that the ncaa didn t originally have all the information needed to make the correct eligibility decision was not accurate
cunningham said on thursday the university submitted all necessary information and documentation as it was made available to us at the time and we still believe tez met all standards for the waiver in early august
it is not clear why the ncaa delayed making the correct decision then but we are pleased to get to the appropriate resolution now
walker who has missed the tar heels first four games after being ruled ineligible to play said he is excited and thankful that the decision has been reversed
this hasn t been easy but i m looking forward to putting this in the past and moving forward walker said
i always knew unc was a special place but it s proved it over and over again throughout the last few months
i ve received so much support from the university the athletics department my coaches the staff and my teammates
walker originally enrolled at north carolina central university nccu but never played a game at the school after the football season was canceled amid the covid pandemic
in the spring of walker transferred to kent state university where he played in the and seasons before then transferring to unc and requesting a waiver that would allow him to play for the tar heels immediately citing mental health issues as the reason for his need to return to his home state
everything that s transpired over the last few months has been with the sole purpose of helping and supporting him and now he s going to have a chance to live his dream unc head coach mack brown added
we want to express our gratitude to the people at unc who have worked tirelessly to assist tez
we never gave up
we also want to thank the ncaa for being willing to re examine tez s case and ultimately deciding to grant him his eligibility
last month after the ncaa denied eligibility to walker unc football posted a strongly worded statement on x formerly twitter from brown condemning the ncaa s decision
plain and simple the ncaa has failed tez and his family and i ve lost all faith in its ability to lead and govern our sport
brown s statement concluded shame on you ncaa
shame on you
following the statement the ncaa said some of its committee members have received violent threats following the decision
the tar heels who have started the season are scheduled to play syracuse on saturday in chapel hill
it is unclear if walker will play
