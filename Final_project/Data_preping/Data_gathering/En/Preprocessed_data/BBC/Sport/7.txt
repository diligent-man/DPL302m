simone biles won her fourth gold medal of the artistic gymnastics world championships on sunday finishing first in the floor exercise as she completes her first international competition since her two year break from gymnastics
despite being penalized for stepping out of the floor area in her routine the high difficulty of her performance meant she finished well clear of second placed rebeca andrade
the gold in floor is biles rd world championship gold medal and was her second of the day having won the beam competition in antwerp belgium
after a disappointing day by her lofty standards on saturday winning silver in the vault and finishing fifth in the uneven bars the year old bounced back in emphatic fashion to win her third gold medal of this year s world championships
the us gymnast recorded a in her attempt finishing ahead of china s zhou yaqin in second place
with four gold medals and one silver added to her already bulging medal cabinet biles appears back to her all conquering best and deserving of the accolade she earned during her time in europe the most decorated female or male gymnast ever
it s been a week to remember for biles who is making her return to the top tier of competitive gymnastics following a two year hiatus after suffering from the twisties a mental block causing a gymnast to lose track of their position in midair during the tokyo olympic games
gold medals in the women s team and all around competitions began a productive few days of action the latter of which was her sixth all around world title and made her the most decorated female or male gymnast ever
saturday s action for biles didn t live up to her high standards though
she earned a silver in the vault after falling upon trying to land her first vault the eponymous biles ii also known as the yurchenko double pike and then fifth in the uneven bars the apparatus in which she has been least successful in over the years
however she was back to her winning ways on sunday performing with her usual assuredness and poise
her routine on the beam included all the requirements needed by the judges all performed with the perfection you come to expect from a biles display
zhou did run biles close with her own performance but the year old s execution was adjudged to be points lower than biles a fine margin between first and second position
brazil s rebeca andrade fresh off of world championship gold in the vault on saturday earned bronze medal with the final performance of the round
and later on sunday biles made it two golds on the same day with an almost perfect display on the floor apparatus
her performance included the usual bounce and precision she has routinely shown over her decorated career
biles has now earned career medals gold four silver three bronze at the world championships as well as a record total medals across both the olympics and the world championships
