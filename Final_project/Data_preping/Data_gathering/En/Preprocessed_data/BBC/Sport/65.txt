it s been years since the most watched tennis match in history took place between female sports icon billie jean king and former men s world no
and self proclaimed male chauvinist bobby riggs
an estimated million tv viewers worldwide tuned into the so called battle of the sexes between king and riggs on september
here s a look back at the historic event
riggs a former wimbledon champion and a shameless self publicist made a fortune from gambling on his own tennis matches
seeing an opportunity to make more money he challenged a year old king and year old margaret court claiming that even at age he could beat the top women tennis players
the winner would take home
king ignored him but court took up the challenge and played him in a match in california on may
king said she had realized the significance of the occasion and had done her best to encourage court to take it seriously
i said margaret it s not a tennis match it s about social change it s about social justice it s about all the things we re working for king recalled
she said court didn t agree with her point of view
she wasn t politically orientated king said
so margaret played him mother s day in and lost
it s called the mother s day massacre and i just thought oh no
after court s loss king changed her mind and agreed to play riggs on september in the houston astrodome
i thought it would set us back years if i didn t win that match said king
it would ruin the women s tour and affect the self esteem of all women
promoters dubbed the match the battle of the sexes and it aired around the world and during primetime television hours in the us
the athletes entrances to the match added to the theatrics king on a gold litter in the style of cleopatra riggs on a rickshaw pulled by women models in skimpy outfits
once the match started king dominated and beat riggs in straight sets
the true winner of the match according to king was something much bigger
to beat a year old guy was no thrill for me she later said
the thrill was exposing a lot of new people to tennis
king and riggs embraced at the end and became friends off the court until his death in of prostate cancer
the drop shot and volley heard around the world said britain s times newspaper proclaimed of her victory
prior to the battle of the sexes king had already made a name for herself an advocate for women s rights
she was instrumental in forming the women s tennis association in a critical moment in the fight for equal opportunity within the sport
it gave us one voice and power to negotiate king told cnn s christiane amanpour earlier this year about the wta
it gave us one voice and power says tennis great billie jean king
the organization also made sure that any girl born in this world if she were good enough would have a place to compete as well as allow all professional women s tennis players not just the top tier athletes to be able to make a living playing the sport that we loved and had a passion to play
king had threatened to boycott the us open if the winner of the women s singles title wasn t paid the same prize money as their male counterpart
in i won the us open and i won and men s champion ilie n stase won
i m not happy king told amanpour
at the press conference in i finally said to them we re not coming back next year unless we get equal prize money and internally i m saying what have i done
it paid off
in the us open became the first major tournament to award equal prize money to men and women
the fight she started for equal pay in all of the grand slam tournaments took years to reach fruition when wimbledon became the last of the four to fall into line in
king credits the match with riggs as a key moment in the fight for equality and women s sports
but speaking to amanpour in june she said the battle isn t over yet
there s tons to do and i m not done yet but i know time is running out and i don t like it king said
i want to do more
