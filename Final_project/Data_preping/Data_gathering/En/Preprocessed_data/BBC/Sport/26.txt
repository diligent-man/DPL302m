cycling has become more than a habit for granny mave as mavis paterson is known
it has become essential for her very being her very reason for living after all three of her adult children passed away within four years of each other sandy in katie in and bob in
it was in memory of her children that the year old grandmother set out on her latest endurance challenge in may cycling miles around scotland beginning from the mull of galloway before heading north tracing the outline of the country until she reached the mull of galloway again
if i didn t have my bicycle and this is terrible to say i don t think i would want to live she told cnn sport
to lose your complete family it s just unbelievable
my daughter once said because one of her friends had died and she said oh mum imagine losing a child i said i know
i couldn t imagine it all mine have gone
cycling has provided some solace some way for her to cope with unimaginable loss
it s been hard for me but i ve managed and people say oh you re strong and i don t know where the strength comes from she said
they ask me
i don t know
i cope my bike helps and i ve got wonderful friends
paterson cycled every day for a month around the circumference of scotland navigating its undulating landscape exposed roads and unpredictable weather
every day she woke up early and set out riding covering up to miles a day and raising money for british based charity macmillan cancer support
all along the route paterson recalled other cyclists coming out to keep her company offering terrific support some of them riding with her for several days at a time
a lot of them have all the cycling gear the cleats in the bike and all the lycra she said
i don t have any of that stuff at all
i ve got ordinary pedals
i can t do cleats i d be falling off the bike all the time i m just a happy cyclist
such support was a constant throughout paterson s odyssey across scotland culminating in a crowd at the finish line who had gathered to cheer her on
and in the middle of the crowd i ve got a grandson who s foot inches and i saw him and i just ran towards him and it was just so exhilarating she said before adding that she celebrated her achievement with a glass of merlot
along the way too she celebrated her th birthday an occasion marked by a party in the scottish town of moffat in between summitting hills on her ride
i hope i don t have to go off my bicycle patterson recalls thinking when cycling over the steepest hill on her ride
but i didn t
i managed to get the top
i huffed and puffed and people say why don t you get an electric bike and i say well no no i don t want a bike that does all the work i want to do the work on the hills so that when i get to the top i say hey i did that
previously accustomed to running marathons and half marathons paterson took up cycling when her knees began giving her problems
she started setting herself challenges in she cycled across canada with her friend though she rode part of it solo when her friend suffered health problems
cycling across saskatchewan province paterson remembers miles and miles of roads and fields with nothing really there and although i was lonely i never felt lonely i used to talk to my bicycle and make a joke of it all
then in she cycled the length of great britain from its most southern point at lands end to its most northern point at john o groats becoming the oldest ever woman to complete the famous route
with each challenge paterson raised money for macmillan cancer support which provides healthcare advice and support for those affected by the disease and her cycle around scotland alone has so far raised almost for the charity more than double her initial target of
i m just amazed at how generous people are and i m so glad i can give money like that to them she said
the training for such an endeavor required paterson to go out cycling in all types of weather five or six times a week
when you re my age if you don t train and you think you can go do something well you can t she says
it s tough training
the training i managed i didn t feel old at all
paterson intends to embark on more endurance challenges and fundraising in the future continuing to ride in memory of her children
i know people have got on their bikes and thought if that old lady can do it i can do it and also people who have been a bit depressed and thought oh gosh i shouldn t be like this
look at poor mave she s lost all her children so a lot of people have taken up cycling because of my cycle rides and just inspired people apparently she said
people keep saying that i m an inspiration
well if i am that s great i m happy about that
