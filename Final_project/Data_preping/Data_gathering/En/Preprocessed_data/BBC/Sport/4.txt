on an unseasonably warm autumnal morning in east london mary beth schumen and her husband have made an early start to their sunday
wearing the blue jerseys of their beloved buffalo bills the indiana couple are easy to spot in leytonstone a quiet corner of the english capital which feels a world away from the fizz and whir of the center of the city where tourists usually flock
nfl attires are rarely seen in these parts
yet on london s underground the schumens are not the only ones in bills blue
mary beth a year old on a bucket list week long trip to england uses her smartphone for direction but there is little need for technological help just follow the other early risers turning the usually most sedate time to be on the capital s public transport into an unfamiliar hubbub of passengers standing shoulder to shoulder shuffling at times like penguins as they engineer some extra space
nfl week how to watch and everything you need to know
it is to the tottenham hotspur stadium that bills fans are heading en masse the home of the aforementioned english premier league side where the bills will host the jacksonville jaguars in the nfl s second international weekend of the season
any fears of the bills lacking the support that they would enjoy at highmark stadium quickly dissipates at the sight of a standing room carriage awash in red white and blue on the way to white hart lane the nearest station stop to the bills adopted home
fans who have never met before chat finding out where the stranger standing nearest to them is from and asking for details on their arrival dates in the uk
a father has brought his two children from the us to london for a day break while a teacher tells a fellow bills fan she needed special permission to skip friday classes to travel to england
she ll be back at work on monday she says
it s a whistle stop weekend for her and many
swaying side to side to the beat of the train is eric schuhmann of saxony germany an nfl fan spending the weekend in london to watch the sport he loves rather than the team he follows
it s another feeling to be live in the stadium he tells cnn sport in anticipation of his third london based nfl game
he has spent he estimates around but as he joyfully talks about the nfl there s a sense the cost matters little
the red and blue of the bills is the predominant color of the day while there is a sprinkling of jaguar turquoise to be seen and union jags flags being sold in a clever piece of marketing
a crowd of fill the stadium a new record for an nfl game at tottenham it is announced over the public address system
it is a superb familial atmosphere a fine advert for the sport on the world stage
the bills mafia was very present and made themselves heard today bills head coach sean mcdermott would tell reporters after the match
super appreciative of the fans that came out
outside the stadium still over three hours from kick off is jenne benjamin from buffalo here in london with her family the oldest members of the clan being her octogenarian grandparents the youngest her year old cousin eden gibson
this is a once in a lifetime experience i ve never been to london and i m in my s
it was a good chance to root for our home team but also see a different country she tells cnn sport explaining the holiday has been a year in the planning ever since the schedule was announced
a lifetime of memories have already been made the family says though the result a win for the jaguars may have soured the afternoon a little
they had better energy than we did said mcdermott afterwards answering a question on whether the bills suffered in having arrived in the uk just on friday
the team would review the game during their sunday flight home an understandably downbeat mcdermott said
we ll need to evaluate everything he added
having played at wembley last week beating the atlanta falcons the jaguars had time to acclimatize and recuperate for this afc battle
whether that was a factor or not it was the visiting team playing in london for the th time the most of any nfl team which started the better taking an lead into the second quarter with zay jones scoring a six yard touchdown to help put the jaguars in command
it was a lead that would prove significant as a thrilling conclusion to the game played out
both sides scored two touchdowns apiece in the last quarter but crucially the jaguars never fell behind
travis etienne ran in twice to give jacksonville a lead before josh allen who threw for yards bulldozed over with the help of his teammates
the game was set for an exciting crescendo but a late fumble from bills wide receiver stefon diggs who finished the afternoon with eight catches receiving yards and a touchdown ended any hopes buffalo had of a comeback
ultimately it was back to back london wins for the jaguars who are now like the bills for the season
