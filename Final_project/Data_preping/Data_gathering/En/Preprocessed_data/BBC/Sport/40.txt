Jim Abbott was used to dealing with uncomfortable social situations in some ways they were all he’d ever known As a child who’d been born without a right hand he had quickly learned that he looked different but no matter how hard he tried to hide it everyone knew I felt the teasing and the bullying of the playground he told CNN Sport I keenly felt the awkward second glances in the school hallways and classrooms
He learned to survive and then thrive but many years later shortly before his th birthday things were suddenly awkward again Now he was sitting in the dugout at Yankee Stadium in New York and all his teammates were ignoring him But there was nothing malicious about it they were trying to help him Abbott was about to pull off a no hitter one of the rarest feats in Major League Baseball And he was going to do it one handed
It never really occurred to Abbott that he had a disability at least it never really occurred to him that there was anything he couldn’t do I don’t think about what could have been or what was taken away he mused My dad used to say to me when I was a kid that what’s been taken away once will come back twice
I loved all sports I loved football basketball and baseball But I always seemed to have a talent for throwing things There was never a plan of playing in the major leagues it was sort of a dream I lived for it
Abbott recalls that he spent much of his childhood tucking his stump into his pocket trying to put others at ease I know that it was a big part of my life I wanted to prove myself and be a part of something Growing up in Flint Michigan he was surrounded by athletes and competitors and he found a support system that saw only potential in his future I certainly ran into friction he said but I felt that anything was possible I was surrounded by parents and coaches and teachers and mentors and I didn’t face resistance I faced encouragement and optimism
During his high school years Abbott played both as a baseball pitcher and a football quarterback and then at the University of Michigan he led the Wolverines to two Big Ten Conference championships from the mound Around the time he turned he was really being noticed becoming the first baseball player ever to receive the prestigious James E Sullivan award which is given annually to the best amateur athlete in the country It was a recognition that propelled his name into the pantheon inhabited by the likes of Carl Lewis Peyton Manning and Michael Phelps In he was the US flagbearer at the Pan American Games and he returned from the Seoul Olympics the following year with a gold medal By the time he was picked in the first round of the MLB draft his disability was almost a forgotten inconvenience
As he would set up to throw his fastball Abbott would position his glove on his stump so that his left hand would follow through and slip quickly inside enabling him to assume a fielding position The move was so seamless that you could easily miss it but his Yankees teammate Don Mattingly never grew tired of watching him do it It always kept you in amazement Mattingly told CNN Sport agreeing that it seemed like a magic trick I can’t even picture being able to do that at the Major League level I couldn’t conceive how he was able to do it that fast and make it look so smooth all at the same time From Abbott’s perspective the move had become second nature he said he’d been doing it since the age of five and it was as natural to him as tying his shoelaces
During his year career as a professional Abbott played for the then California Angels the New York Yankees the Chicago White Sox and the Milwaukee Brewers but there is one game that stands out clearly above all the others On September th Abbott threw a no hitter against the then Cleveland Indians a feat he describes as the greatest highlight of his career
No hitters are incredibly rare the Yankees have played more than games since and they’ve only ever managed of them Baseball insiders will tell you that nobody ever sees a no hitter coming and that was certainly true for Jim Abbott Not just because of his disability but because nobody in the famous pinstripes had thrown one in more than a decade when Abbott stepped onto the mound on a cloudy afternoon in the Bronx And the last person expecting to see a no no was Abbott himself
I had some pretty serious anxiety about that game Abbott said in He was up against the same Cleveland lineup that had smashed him all over the park just five days previously Facing him on the mound were some of the most impressive batters of the day power hitter Jim Thome would end up with homers to his name putting him No in the all time list and although Manny Ramirez was only three days into his major league career he’d make it to th on the home run list with Albert Belle was one of the leading sluggers of the day and Kenny Lofton was renowned as one of the best lead off men of his generation
When he’d faced them in Cleveland the previous week Abbott gave up hits and seven runs and was taken out of the game before he’d been able to complete four innings I had gotten absolutely shelled he recalled He was reportedly sent on a three mile run as punishment For the next start against the Indians Abbott and his catcher Matt Nokes came up with a plan to mix it up with more curveballs and other breaking balls and it worked
I remember looking up at the scoreboard in the fifth inning and saw we were winning by four to nothing he recalled It wasn’t a perfect game but I noticed that they didn’t have any hits Abbott remembers trying to control his emotions despite the anticipation building in the stadium the cheers of more than fans gaining in volume with every out and his teammates abiding by the stupid superstition of ignoring him in the dugout Those final few innings are nerve wracking you feel it in your heart your knees and in your breathing noted Abbott
There was a scare in the ninth when Lofton attempted a bunt that rolled foul down the third base line But he was retired shortly afterwards followed by Felix Fermin whose fly ball was caught in center field by Bernie Williams Abbott’s place in MLB history was then secured when Carlos Baerga hit a grounder to shortstop Randy Velarde who fired to Don Mattingly at first base for the final out
When that final out comes it’s just like this ecstatic release You feel like you’re plugged into a wall It feels electric Abbott told CNN
Mattingly has spoken of the goosebumps he could feel tingling his arms in the last couple of innings because he knew how special it would be for a player like Abbott to throw a no hitter Overall he struggled with us through those years but the competitor he was and how much he cared was awesome I loved playing with this guy
Since Abbott’s masterpiece had come on a day game on a Saturday an evening of celebration in New York was inevitable Mattingly recalls that they headed to one of his favorite chicken wing restaurants downtown for a few beers and a few cocktails Abbott concurs that he had a bit of a headache the next morning
I was blown away by the reaction he said I was signing autographs taxi cabs were honking and people were running across the street and I’ve been so heartened that people have remembered that game
But the legacy of Jim Abbott is about much more than just that September day in
By pitching from the mound in the iconic Yankees pinstripes and by playing for a decade in MLB Abbott became a role model to disabled children all over the country He can’t say how many he has helped but he says that in every town or city there were always young families who came to be inspired by his story I wouldn’t be able to guess the numbers they’re sort of staggering but I think of the kids a lot and the look in their parents’ eyes
In at the age of he called time on his playing career I just lost some velocity like a lot of people do I played for years I would have liked to play for more but I loved every second of it Retirement wasn’t the end of his story though Abbott was able to hit the speaking circuit where he continued sharing his message of hope
Mattingly believes that his legacy is profound I think Jim’s had more of an impact on people than maybe of anybody that’s ever played this game he told CNN Abbott says that he’s still in touch with many of the kids that he’s encountered many of whom have grown up to make their own mark in the world He talks about his friend Nick Newell who was born with a congenital amputation of his left arm Newell idolized Abbott as a child and he grew up to be a Mixed Martial Arts fighter Abbott also mentions the college basketball player Kevin Laue who was also born without a left forearm and Shaquem Griffin who played four years in the NFL without a left hand I see the look in their eyes he says I see the determination and it gives me hope
The ultimate validation of his legacy would be for another one handed player to make it in Major League Baseball and Abbott is sure it will happen one day I absolutely think it’s possible he stated emphatically There’s just too many talented kids out there There’s a world of possibilities for people born with challenges that require them to do things differently but that doesn’t mean you can’t do them just as well
Mattingly is still involved in the game he’s currently working as a bench coach for the Toronto Blue Jays He says he hopes to see another player like Abbott in the Major leagues
Lightning strikes more than once he said There’s a child out there that loves this game but may have a similar disability Jim has already cut that trail and even though it may be a little overgrown that trail is still out there It can be done
Abbott tries not to hide his stump anymore He’s come to terms with who he is and he’s thankful for it If he’d been born with two hands he can’t even say that he would have been a better player
I don’t know that I would have had the ambition which wasn’t always pretty I believe that the push from having one hand took me to places I probably wouldn’t have gone without it
