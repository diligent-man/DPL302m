for claire heafford the abuse she says she suffered as a young gymnast has left a lasting mark on her life
heafford who s now in her s told cnn sport she experienced symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder ptsd after competing in british gymnastics in the s when she alleges she was physically and emotionally abused
now she says she finally feels vindicated after years fighting for reform in the sport through the organization she co founded gymnasts for change
last week an independent review concluded that british gymnastics allowed for a culture of physical and emotional abuse and failed to provide a safe environment for gymnasts with children body shamed belittled and abused
heafford said she felt a massive feeling of vindication following the release of a review conducted by barrister anne whyte saying it completely validated everything that we d anecdotally known and had been reporting and campaigning on for two years
released thursday whyte s plus page review concluded that british gymnastics should have been aware of the bullying harassment and excessive control that occurred in training clubs between and
my own experience was that i was trained by the first russian that was brought over to the uk in the s heafford told cnn s amanda davies
i grew up in a soviet training camp in the heart of the home counties the counties surrounding london
it was too bizarre to be believed
so as a kid just at an ordinary state school trying to explain to my school friends what my training life was like was difficult she said
in the report whyte highlighted the recruitment of a significant number of coaches from the former soviet union and the soviet bloc
the technical skill and experience of these coaches whilst formidable was sometimes accompanied by an attitude to the gymnast which was autocratic and dismissive and left athletes feeling like commodities whyte wrote adding that the ability of these coaches to produce decorated gymnasts was admired and later emulated by coaches in the uk
heafford says what she experienced in the s mirrors incidents reported to whyte who was commissioned by uk sport and sport england to review allegations that british gymnastics failed to address complaints for decades
whyte received over submissions and interviewed people after her call for evidence in august
in response to the review british gymnastics chief executive sarah powell admitted thursday that the organization failed the sport of gymnastics and apologized on behalf of the sporting body
i wish to accept all of the recommendations and the key findings and we will work hard to ensure that these are acted upon quickly and robustly stated powell
but most importantly i want to wholeheartedly apologize on behalf of the leadership and the board for those gymnasts who have suffered because we have not met the standards that are expected for our sport
when you do try to raise the alarm as a child and you re shut down it makes you think that if you do speak out you re not going to be believed heafford who left the sport in told cnn
from that point on i never watched gymnastics
i got the hell away from it
and i went into athletics which is where i had wonderful experiences and i loved every minute of being a track and field athlete
so it was only when i stopped competing that i started to get ptsd symptoms showing up from my time in gymnastics she added
after distancing herself from the sport for years heafford now coaches adults in gymnastics runs body positive gymnastics classes and campaigns for change in the sport particularly for the recognition of historic abuse
other gymnasts have been vocal in their support of the report s release
two time olympian becky downie who competed for great britain in the and olympic games said the report feels like a vindication for myself and so many who have known for so long of the serious cultural problems within the sport
a sport i love more than anything
finally everyone knows the truth and while it won t directly benefit those who have experienced it it s encouraging to know that if the recommendations are implemented it ll protect and enhance the next generation of gymnasts she wrote on instagram and twitter
whyte recommended systemic changes in her review including calling on british gymnastics to improve its complaints system by offering better guidance on how concerns should be investigated and strengthening how complaints are monitored so that patterns of abuse can be better recognized
whyte also recommended that british gymnastics reassess the level of responsibility delegated to volunteers and employ trained expert staff as well as introducing mandatory safeguarding training for all club owners and managers
she added that british gymnastics must appoint board members with expertise in promoting the welfare of children and protecting them from harm as well as a director of education with responsibility for the education of coaches and welfare officers
downie added while it ll never make what has been allowed to happen to myself and so many others ok it has been made clear us athletes have been heard and i m overwhelmingly encouraged for the future of young gymnasts in this country
uk sport and sport england said they accepted and endorsed the review s recommendations and that they would continue to support british gymnastics
at this time our intention is to continue to fund british gymnastics as we believe that withdrawing funding would not only prevent them from implementing the vital changes outlined in the report but also negatively impact on the support to and wellbeing of gymnasts now the joint uk sport and sport england statement reads
however we are clear that continued funding for british gymnastics will depend on its new leadership team making significant changes to the sport to the timelines set out in the report s recommendations
this week year old former elite acrobatic gymnast eloise jotischky won the first civil case against british gymnastics for the abuse she said she experienced at the hands of a coach
she and heafford are among a group of plaintiffs involved in civil cases focusing on historic abuse by coaches who fell under the auspices of british gymnastics according to a representative for gymnastics for change
british gymnastics admitted full liability in jotischky s case and reached a settlement with the former gymnast whom the bbc reported also received an apology from the chief executive of the organization
jotischky who said her coach subjected her to inappropriate weight management techniques and verbal harassment told cnn sport in an email she was glad the report had finally exposed the catastrophic safeguarding failures that led to the abuse of hundreds of gymnasts
in the report whyte highlighted submissions detailing how some coaches went to damaging lengths to control what gymnasts ate and weighed to the extent of searching luggage and rooms for food
as a result some gymnasts suffered from and still suffer from eating disorders and associated mental health issues
jotischky who competed in the sport between the ages of eight and told cnn sport she was encouraged that british gymnastics intended to implement the report s recommendations
but she expressed concern saying that more needs to be done to address and reform the endemic culture of abuse that has been so deeply ingrained within the sport
in particular jotischky said she believes a register of coaches is critical without a register of coaches parents will never know when their child is being coached by someone who has had allegations of abuse against them
the failures of the past have proved that parents should not be shut out especially in a sport where the coaches are being entrusted with the welfare of young children
when approached for a comment on jotischky s remarks british gymnastics declined to comment further
jotischky said that since becoming the first gymnast to win her legal case against british gymnastics she has been overwhelmed by the number of gymnasts who have contacted her to share their experiences
it shows there are so many gymnasts who are afraid to speak out publicly and that must change she said
heafford agreed
the reality is that national governing bodies operate within a vacuum from a legal point of view
and the only thing that will bring actual cultural change to sport generally and specifically to the sport of gymnastics is legislative change she said adding that she is calling for mandatory reporting whereby parents gymnasts and coaches within training facilities would legally be required to report any abuse they observed
heafford said that it was difficult for survivors to speak up adding there is such defensiveness within the culture of gymnastics
you know that as a gymnast if you speak out about culture there will be repercussions
you ll be ostracized from the community so it s not an easy thing to do she said
uk sport and sport england referred cnn to last week s joint statement when approached for further comment
the report comes as gymnastics institutions worldwide have been forced to reckon with claims of abuse and safeguarding failures following an outpouring of survivor testimony
in march more than former and current gymnasts in canada called for an investigation into ongoing toxic and abusive practices gymnasts are allegedly subject to in the country
in an open letter addressed to sport canada the athletes have called for the governing body to conduct an independent third party investigation
at the time gymcan said it was aware of the letter being circulated and agreed that an external and independent organization must be established to oversee complaints
canadian gymnasts allege abuse neglect and discrimination within the sport
in may gymcan and its provincial member organizations said they had been informed by the media of a proposed class action lawsuit filed with the supreme court of british columbia in which they are named as defendants
although we have not been served the allegations we have been made aware of in the claim describe behaviour that is unacceptable in any sport environment and we take them very seriously gymcan said in a statement adding they are committed to addressing all allegations with diligence and due process
this comes four years after disgraced former usa gymnastics doctor larry nassar was sentenced to up to years in michigan state prison after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct
at the sentencing victims including olympic gold medalists aly raisman and mckayla maroney recounted stories of how they went to nassar to receive treatment for sports injuries only to be sexually assaulted and told it was a form of treatment
attorneys for more than women and girls who were sexually abused by nassar this month submitted claims for over billion to the fbi saying investigators could have ended nassar s predation and protected other victims had they not mishandled the case
the claimants include olympic gymnasts simone biles raisman and maroney and world championship medalist maggie nichols
each has asked for million according to the law firm that represents them
cnn this month contacted the department of justice which oversees the fbi and officials there declined to comment
