coco gauff was defeated by world no
iga wi tek in the semifinals of the china open on saturday ending her match win streak
world no
gauff has enjoyed the best spell of her career this summer becoming a grand slam champion for the first time at the us open and embarking on the longest winning streak by an american teenager since serena williams in according to the wta
but that all came to end as wi tek cruised to a win against the american in beijing
i m really proud of myself gauff said afterwards according to the china open
hopefully next year i can continue this consistency maybe not in a row on a consistent level but as long as i can string along some wins title wins and hopefully a grand slam would be a great goal for me
gauff and wi tek are used to playing each other
they have faced each other more than any other opponent and the match almost always ends in wi tek favor
the pole has now defeated gauff eight times and lost only once
wi tek dominated the first set hitting just four unforced errors and conceding zero break points as she coasted to a lead
she then broke gauff in the first game of the second set and the match paused at when gauff called a medical timeout due to an injured right shoulder
gauff continued to play but she could not stem the tide and succumbed to her first defeat since august ending the longest winning streak on the wta tour this year according to reuters
it feels like i can play freely again so i m really happy wi tek said per the wta afterwards following a period in which she has relinquished her world no
status and crashed out the us open in the round of
it s been a while since i felt that way
so i ll remember for the rest of my career that even though tougher times may come in your mind you can always overcome that and with hard work you can achieve it
wi tek will now face world no
