europe s rising anxiety was finally quelled when england s tommy fleetwood facing rickie fowler in the penultimate match struck a sensational tee shot to help take the th hole guaranteeing at least a tie in their singles match and consequently the ryder cup

but i am so proud of my guys they formed a bond from day one they gave me everything
this is why the ryder cup is so special to me and the guys we play for each other we will share those memories forever

i m so proud of my team it s been the greatest week of my life

team usa will have the chance to secure a three peat on home turf when the th ryder cup tees off at bethpage black new york in
for europe the victory seals a dream double after its women s team completed a dramatic comeback to retain the solheim cup in spain last week
the american team awoke sunday with a mountain of historic heights to scale though after the opening day s showing it could have been a lot worse
a horror start from the visitors had seen europe record their first opening session sweep and some jon rahm heroics helped send the hosts into the weekend with a lead
even the relief of max homa and brian harman securing team usa s first win which came on saturday morning was offset by a record humiliation for scottie scheffler and brooks koepka at the hands of scandinavian duo viktor hovland and ludvig aberg
usa s scottie scheffler in tears after record ryder cup loss as europe extend dominance
scheffler was left in tears and out of the afternoon lineup
yet despite a world no
sized hole in the roster team usa finally found their footing patrick cantlay s back to back birdies clinching a fourballs win and a first session victory for the visitors
that cut the overall deficit to but still left the americans needing to rewrite the history books to successfully defend the cup
no side had ever recovered from five points adrift on the final day the biggest singles day fightbacks coming from down at two famous tournaments the us at brookline in and europe at medinah in
donald sent out his biggest stars to try and finish the job quickly with rahm rory mcilroy and hovland all deployed in the first four matches
scheffler the only player boasting a higher world ranking than the trio was tasked with stopping rahm in a mouthwatering opening contest that saw deafening grandstand roars welcome the pair to the first tee
yet it was hovland who secured the day s first point settling european nerves by easing past collin morikawa with a victory
it marked a fitting send off for the norwegian who dazzled throughout to finish the week and nudge his side to within three points of victory
seeing that the us were leading in six matches hovland remarked that there was a little too much red on the leaderboard
rahm answered the call immediately serving up yet more th green magic to secure a half point from a pulsating back and forth duel with scheffler
the spaniard knocked a putt for eagle from nearly feet to within inches of the hole enough to preserve his unbeaten run in rome after his american opponent failed to chip in
tyrrell hatton and mcilroy then put europe on the brink with victories over harman and sam burns respectively
tears of joy marked a full circle moment for the unbeaten mcilroy almost two years to the day since his tearful outpouring that he should have done more at whistling straits
i was so disappointed in my performance there so to come here to rome and win four points it means a lot to me mcilroy told sky sports
the team we have is incredible
it s a young team it will be around for a long time the support we had was absolutely incredible and it s been a great week for me personally
victory was tantalizingly close but the visitors refused to exit quietly
max homa provided a spark celebrating wildly having edged england s matt fitzpatrick up shortly after koepka had taken his revenge on aberg for saturday s loss with a win
xander schauffele saw off denmark s nicolai h jgaard by the same scoreline giving voice to the us contingent who had made the trip across the atlantic
chants of usa usa usa rung out as the gap closed to four
with justin thomas and spieth leading sepp straka and lowry respectively the chase was very much on
enter fleetwood and one of the week s great tee shots
fowler s subsequent drive into the water eased the burden on the englishman his american opponent subsequently conceding to signal an end to a valiant fightback that was ultimately left too late
