Max Verstappen was crowned Formula One world champion for the third time securing the title in the sprint race at the Qatar Grand Prix on Saturday
There are few outcomes in sport that seem inevitable
Human and in F engineering error can strike at any moment with competitors waiting to pounce
But occasionally someone comes along and dominates in a way that any anticipation any lingering tension regarding the outcome dissipates
Verstappen’s coronation was a moment that has seemed inevitable since the very first race of the season when he led the field from start to finish at the Bahrain Grand Prix
Is Red Bull’s RB the greatest F car ever
The -year-old who has won of races so far this season needed to finish sixth or above in the sprint race a shortened version of a traditional main Sunday race which was first introduced in the season to win the title
When teammate Sergio Prez the only other driver who could challenge Verstappen to the championship crashed out in the th of laps meaning he would not earn any championship points it ensured the Dutchman who finished second in the race won the title
Super proud of the job of the team Max Verstappen told Sky Sports
To be three-time world champion is just incredible
With Verstappen qualifying third for the km race under the lights at the Lusail circuit and Prez five places behind at the start line it felt inevitable that Verstappen would successfully defend his title on Saturday
McLaren’s Oscar Piastri who qualified in pole position won an exciting sprint which featured three safety cars
His teammate Lando Norris was third overtaking Mercedes’ George Russell late in the race
Overtures of a potential fight within Red Bull itself began playing early in the season as Sergio Prez and Verstappen shared two wins apiece after the first four races but the Dutchman’s record-breaking run of consecutive wins confirmed his absolute authority
Such has been the dominance of Red Bull that at one point it seemed probable rather than possible that the team would win every race of the season
That achievement faded away when Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz won the Singapore Grand Prix last month but it has not diminish the scale of Red Bull’s achievement
The team sealed its second consecutive constructors’ championship at the Japanese Grand Prix last month with six races still remaining
Its car has been widely hailed as one of the greatest ever built in the sport somehow proving even more successful than last year’s model which won of races
When such an impressive car is driven by one of the all-time greats which Verstappen now is it is sporting alchemy
Everything that he’s done this year has been phenomenal team principal Christian Horner told Sky Sports
He’s the most competitive driver that I’ve ever met
The determination that he drives with the passion the heart the commitment and of course the abundance of skill that he has he’s up there with the very best
With this title Verstappen joins greats Jack Brabham Jackie Stewart Niki Lauda Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna as the sport’s three-time world champions
