soccer players at the women s world cup will on average earn just cents for every dollar earned by men at their world cup last year a new cnn analysis found
still that is an improvement last time in it was less than eight cents per dollar according to data provided by world governing body fifa and global players union fifpro
the gender pay gap will be very much alive and kicking at a tournament which begins on july in australia and new zealand
fifa announced in june that for the first time about million of the record million women s world cup prize money would go directly to individual players at least each for participating and to each player on the winning squad
the rest of the pot is going to be split between participating federations who will decide what share of this money to allocate to teams and players if any at all
in addition to prize money fifa committed to paying million to the federations and players clubs for women s world cup preparations
when asked for comment soccer s world governing body referred cnn to what fifa president gianni infantino said in march when the organization announced details of the prize money on offer at this year s tournament
at the time he said fifa was embarking on a historic journey for women s football and for equality adding that the aim was equality in payments for the men s and women s world cups in and respectively
with its estimated worldwide audience of more than one billion viewers the women s world cup is one of the biggest sporting events on the planet
yet this year s edition kicks off in australia and new zealand with the sport at somewhat of an inflection point not least because of the disparity between what women players are paid in comparison to their male counterparts
players such as australia s sam kerr as well as megan rapinoe and alex morgan of the us women s national team uswnt are celebrated as household names while england s lionesses adorn billboards across the country
the popularity of the sport is undoubtedly growing but from jamaica to canada south africa to spain several teams arrive at this tournament having been locked in disputes with their federations
despite the huge progress made in recent years the fight for respect and equity or sometimes to even be paid at all continues
when jamaica s havana solaun threaded the ball into the net against australia four years ago she was mobbed by her teammates as they celebrated the first women s world cup goal in their nation s history
having overcome almost every conceivable obstacle the team disbanded in before an unlikely heroine bob marley s daughter cedella came to the rescue here they were competing at the pinnacle of the sport
two months later the players still hadn t been paid by the jamaica football federation jff
eventually they were but four years on and history is beginning to repeat itself
jamaica s chinyelu asher a member of the fifpro global players council told cnn sport the current squad has reached a breaking point
just weeks before their first game jamaica s players released a statement expressing their utmost disappointment with the jff saying that the women s team had missed several friendly matches due to extreme disorganization and that they had showed up repeatedly without receiving contractually agreed upon compensation
asher told cnn sport ahead of the tournament we just need the federation to know that we are holding them accountable and we are taking that matter seriously and we don t really have time to waste we re still trying to give them space to make up for lost time and to shift gears in a way that supports the best performance we can have
women s world cup kicks off
cnn has reached out to the jff for comment but did not receive a reply at the time of publication
in a statement on its website the jff acknowledged that things have not been done perfectly but that it is working assiduously to resolve players concerns
the reggae girlz now have a contractual agreement with their national federation according to asher but still had to release a public statement to ensure that they received the best possible support for a world cup
the people holding the torch in the equal pay fight are normally the active players and that s a really vulnerable space to be asher said
if you re having to fight against people that are creating opportunities for you to play it can get really messy
soccer players pay is composed of many different elements salaries from their club match fees when representing their national team prize money and sponsorship
as such equal pay can become nebulous
while morgan and rapinoe were the highest paid female soccer players last year earning million each on and off the pitch their most successful male counterpart cristiano ronaldo was earning million from both on field and off field revenue forbes estimated
but morgan and rapinoe s own estimated multimillion dollar earnings are an outlier at even the highest echelons of the sport
while top earners wages in countries such as the us and france average nearly per year salaries vary greatly between countries and can be less than per month if any at all according to a report by global players union fifpro
the report also found that across the board top female players get paid the same or less in a year than what male soccer players of the same level receive per month
having meager or poor compensation is unacceptable because these footballers who are the best in their country are dedicating hours weeks months and years of their time towards representing their national team on the highest level jonas baer hoffmann fifpro s general secretary told cnn sport
the women s world cup is an important source of income for players
but many who will be competing over the next few weeks have needed other jobs to sustain themselves
a fifpro report released in june found two thirds of surveyed players reported having to take unpaid leave from another job to play for their national team in world cup qualifying tournaments such as the concacaf w championship or the women s africa cup of nations
almost a third weren t paid by their national teams at all during these past months and for those who were paid it was often dependent on participation and performance creating instability
it s not like an amusement park we re footballers most of us are pro players asher said recalling that she worked as a coach at points during her career to help make ends meet
this is our career and that deserves compensation and a reward for the work that s put through she said
according to a fifa benchmarking report nearly a quarter of clubs across national leagues have mainly amateur players while the rest work with a mix of professionals who have an official contract with the club and are paid more than their incurred expenses and amateurs
more than half of the surveyed federations still don t have regulations on players minimum wages
ahead of the women s world cup infantino threatened a tournament broadcast blackout in five major european countries over unacceptable offers of media rights
though it should be noted that fifa isn t short of money its record breaking revenue during the cycle stood at billion
fifa s move to introduce individual prize money this year came after more than players from national teams backed by their global union fifpro sent a letter to soccer s governing body last october calling for equal conditions and prize money
many players at the women s world cup come into the tournament as amateurs or semi professional which undermines their preparation and in turn the quality of football we see on the pitch said fifpro in the letter sent to infantino in october adding that many players also had no agreement with their member associations to ensure guaranteed world cup compensation
baer hoffmann told cnn that the prize money guarantee to players was an important step towards giving more of them financial independence and an ability to focus on becoming the best they can be but also called for national federations to give their players much more financial support in the intervening years between each world cup
the gender pay gap is typically referred to in monetary terms measuring how much women earn for every dollar a man earns
but for the players equal pay encompasses more than simply closing this gap to the salaries enjoyed by male footballers
i know that s not realistic immediately asher said highlighting the importance of facilities scheduling and maternity leave
anything that creates space for a professional women s player to show up and feel just as professional as a man
with some of the women s world cup money ringfenced for players new zealand captain ali riley told cnn s amanda davies that this represents a huge milestone even if it isn t the finish line
at the beginning of her career riley recalled playing in the world cup was just for honor rather than something that could provide financial security
it s not just the increase in prize money she added
but also the equal conditions in terms of the delegation size and having single rooms
these are things that you would have thought we would have had a long time ago
meanwhile canada s players told a parliamentary committee in march that the team had been forced to cut training programs and staff were paid significantly less than their male counterparts in the year they became olympic champions and that there had been disregard for any attempt to establish a women s domestic league
according to cnn analysis of canada soccer financial accounts the federation spent more than double on men s national soccer teams million in than on women s teams million
and in when the men s team qualified for the world cup for the first time since and was eliminated in the group stages canada soccer spent even more million on men s national teams of all ages
the women s national team qualified for the world cup too but their teams only got million
canada soccer said that it has proposed a landmark equal pay agreement that would see the women s team become the second highest paid national team but an agreement has yet to be reached
cnn has reached out to canada soccer for comment but has not received a response at the time of publication
for all the practical barriers to gender equality in soccer it is sexist attitudes and shifting the attitudinal barriers that s the toughest former executive director of women s soccer australia heather reid told cnn sport
such attitudes are deeply entrenched
until relatively recently women were not even able to play soccer in several countries around the world
it was quite unsuitable for females an english football association fa minute book said in and the organization banned women from playing at its clubs until
the french football federation only recognized women s soccer in and the royal belgium football association a year later
even today most decision makers in soccer continue to be men uefa s executive committee has members of whom are men while fifa s council has members of whom are men
all but one of those women sitting on those decision making bodies fill quota seats specifically reserved for women
and nearly three quarters of head coaches across all women s soccer leagues are still male with no women at all in top positions in germany iceland the netherlands and norway according to the fifa benchmarking report
i think it s a mindset
it s tradition riley said
the women s game is still new
the recent history of women s soccer is intertwined with its fight for equal pay and treatment
days before the start of the world cup england s lionesses announced they would put on hold discussions with their federation over performance related bonuses until the end of the tournament
earlier in july the english football association said it will not be paying bonuses to the players for their world cup performance on top of the individual prize money pledged by fifa
we are disappointed that a resolution has still not been achieved the players said in a statement
four years ago chants of equal play equal pay echoed around the stadium as the uswnt lifted the world cup trophy
i think you need to see the increase in prize money at this world cup in the context of probably a decade of actions that happened domestically obviously in the united states but in all kinds of countries players have made these pushes with their unions as a collective to increase the standards in their country fifpro s baer hoffmann told cnn s amanda davies
uswnt players reached an equal pay deal with us soccer in may after six years of legal wrangling dating back to a claim of wage discrimination filed in by five of the team s stars carli lloyd rapinoe morgan hope solo and becky sauerbrunn and a gender discrimination lawsuit that the whole team filed in
as a result the uswnt earned more money from its male counterparts reaching the knockout stages of the world cup in qatar than it did from winning its own tournaments in and
it was challenging lloyd told cnn sport adding that they were calling attorneys reading documents and holding team meetings on legal strategy all while in training camps
for six years we had been in this fight and nobody wants to be fighting with their employer she added
but long gone were the days of thinking that we just need to accept what s given to us
so it was our duty to fight and to make the sport better just like all the players before us had done

there were different challenges for the generation before lloyd the generation who advocated for and participated in the fledgling international tournaments of the late s and early s
in the old days players paid to represent their country reid said recalling that every player had to contribute when australia traveled to china for the fifa women s invitation tournament a pilot world cup
while the sport has professionalized since then those same issues still disfigure it
people want to know what s the progress been like from the last world cup asher said
and i m like we re here doing it again
