omie dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers
there s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim once you ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water the year old dale who is based in southeast london tells cnn sport
even though swimming is a joyful experience for dale the stark reality is that many black communities in britain and the us do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation a problem that is especially alarming given that as dale says it is the only sport that can save your life
the lack of access afforded to black communities in britain is what motivated dale to become a swimming teacher in september
i used to work in kensington in london as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough but also some of the poorest she says
she saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim yet hardly any children of the same age that dale saw from state schools could swim meters
there s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming dale adds
she is a director of swimunity a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in north kensington west london
it was born in the wake of the grenfell tower disaster in when a residential block caught on fire killing people and leaving many more without homes
there s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons who have undergone some form of trauma whether that be water related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives dale says
many people say it s like an escape from their daily lives or is actually the first time that they ve taken time for themselves
while of children from the most affluent families in england can swim meters unaided only from the least affluent families can according to a survey from sport england a non departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in england
about of black adults and of black children in england do not regularly participate in swimming according to sport england s report published in january
likewise about of asian adults and of asian children including those with indian pakistani and bangladeshi heritage do not regularly participate in swimming the same research found
this trend extends to the us where nearly of black children have low or no ability to swim compared with of their white peers according to data from the country s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level usa swimming
the underrepresentation of black people in the pool in the us can be traced back to the early th century
public swimming pools became popular in north america in the s and s and were initially open to all
however northern politicians stipulated a whites only rule referencing racist fears about black men fraternizing with white women
even after legal racial segregation ended in the us in public pools continued to be hostile environments
as people of color began to use public pools white swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for black families who cannot afford the cost
similar examples in britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of black people in pools
for example more than million people in the uk live in ethnically diverse communities where covid national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools according to swim england england s national swimming governing body and the black swimming association bsa a uk based charity that aims to encourage more african caribbean and asian communities to take up swimming
globally drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury related death and at least people die each year from drowning according to data from the world health organization who
children are particularly affected with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged years in of countries studied by the who
and while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors so are lower socioeconomic status lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority depending on the country who research shows
most drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place says dale who was awarded swim teacher of the year by swim england in
in december three members of the same black british family a year old father and his two children died in a swimming pool at a resort in costa del sol spain reuters reported
the father and his year old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine year old daughter who was drowning
danielle obe is the co founder and chair of the bsa
she told cnn sport that the costa del sol deaths prompted her to establish the bsa in march alongside olympic swimmer alice dearing journalist seren jones and songwriter rapper and producer ed accura
this was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community obe says
at that point i called alice and seren and i said we ve been talking about doing something for our community
we ve got to do something
we ve got to do it now
we cannot keep recovering bodies
we ve got to do something
we ve got to do it now
we cannot keep recovering bodies
it s no longer just about that lack of representation obe adds
it s now about saving lives vital water safety education for all
swimming is an intervention
swimming is a life skill
however there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning related deaths by ethnicity in the uk says obe
at the moment we don t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities aquatic fatalities for different communities in the uk because up until now drowning data isn t really captured by ethnicity which is another point another issue that the bsa is looking to tackle
dearing the first black female swimmer to represent britain at the olympics when she competed at tokyo implores people to learn to swim
i have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first black woman to represent gb in swimming but wanting to be my own person my own athlete who s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together she tells cnn sport
i take the two of them just as they are kind of like separate things
i m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that i can be to show people that they can do the sport that the sport is for everybody
at the age of dearing was making history in japan and became a beacon of hope for young people especially black girls who wanted to break into the sport
but her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming
fortunately for myself i haven t come across any barriers at the level i m at currently dearing says
but i have faced barriers when i was younger and issues where people just don t think black people should swim or do swim or think that we re better suited to other sports and so shouldn t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place
cnn reached out to the international swimming federation fina sport england and usa swimming requesting a breakdown of black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport
however they told cnn they were unable to provide such data
fina the global governing body for swimming told cnn it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level
fina said in it allocated million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its swimming for all swimming for life program
fina remains fully committed to non discrimination the organization said to cnn in a statement
fina continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes coaches and administrators are treated equally
work will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area fina added
i have faced barriers when i was younger and issues where people just don t think black people should swim or do swim or think that we re better suited to other sports and so shouldn t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place
sport england told cnn in a statement that it is committed to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across england to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities
barriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups like women people with long term health conditions disabled people people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio economic groups the statement added
sport england said in may it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its partners to more than million million which they ve selected due to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector their own networks and beyond
it s not all about the economic side of things
it is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic based sports joel shinofield the managing director of sport development at usa swimming told cnn during a phone call
usa swimming is a membership serviced organization that has over clubs and more than members according to the official website
our goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they re good ones
while our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level the resources guidance support financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access he added
shinofield said that usa swimming has established a year initiative that will grant million to develop learn to swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by historical black colleges and universities hbcus
the program was announced in according to the usa swimming official website
from representing their organization at the uk s first equality diversity and inclusion summit for sport in birmingham england earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in hackney one of the most deprived boroughs in london obe hopes that the bsa will help bridge the barrier through community level engagement
that community engagement really is to build trust accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector says obe
only in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change
in august the bsa announced it would conduct a research program with the royal national lifeboat institution and the university of portsmouth exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent african caribbean and asian communities from swimming
there s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim once you ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water
speaking about the program obe says it s important for us to inspire confidence with african caribbean and asian communities and the only way we re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don t engage in aquatics why we don t see the representation pool side and why we don t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations
dale also volunteers with mental health swims a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet ups for people struggling with their mental health
as part of her work for the organization she coordinates swim events in south london to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport
she also volunteers for pride in water a network that aims to increase lgbtq representation in swimming
dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for african caribbean and asian communities she s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport
i really think if anything is going to change it s going to be now it s going to be over the next couple of years she says
each story is different each person is different and has to be understood in their own way and there s nothing wrong with that that s just another challenge that we have to face and we re up for it
it s tough it s not a quick fix but the future is bright
i like to feel that i m giving something back to swimming and hopefully giving something to the black community to hopefully achieve strive for and change the way that black people are viewed in swimming and the way black people view swimming
it s a double edged sword i absolutely love doing it
sometimes it s really frightening and daunting but if i m trying to make the world a better place then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself
