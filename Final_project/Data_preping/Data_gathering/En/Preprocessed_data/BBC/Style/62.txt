CNN — For Jeff Leatham a floral arrangement isn’t just well flowers
It’s an invitation to travel through time
Over the last three decades the celebrity florist has worked at the highest levels transforming the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills and Paris among other venues with breathtaking installations curating florals for countless over-the-top weddings and celebrity events — in particular in a longstanding collaboration with the Kardashian-Jenner family — and receiving accolades including France’s Chevalier Legion of Honour the highest military and civil honor the country can bestow
In all that time the florist has witnessed first-hand the power flowers hold to transport the viewer to a pivotal moment in their lives
His job isn’t just about arranging pretty blooms — although he does so with profound skill — but to present a moment of raw natural beauty that tugs at some core memory
In his latest book The Art of the Flower Leatham returns to some of those signature emotive moments
The retrospective also underscores the jaw-dropping scale of so many of his projects Entire rooms carpeted in red roses from floor to ceiling an indoor pool encircled in archway after archway of baby pink orchids peonies appearing to rain down from the sky
Leatham’s floral designs don’t just take you into the past they make a definitive imprint on the present
They are in as much as the flowers themselves are ephemeral unforgettable
Jeff Leatham For me it’s the amount of joy that a floral arrangement brings to people
With the work that I do in hotel lobbies the amount of people rushing by who will stop in their tracks to look and take it all in — that for me is so important
When someone sees beauty — especially beauty that’s from nature
All these years later it still really takes my breath away how the beauty of nature takes people aback
They bring back certain memories especially with different seasons they’re like old friends that go away and then come back to visit again
There’s also flowers that bring you back to certain times of your life —my father’s mother passed away when I was very young but every time I see or smell a lilac it immediately takes me back to when I was four years old to when I was visiting with her and she had giant lilac bushes in front of her house
I think a lot of people have stories like that with flowers
They take them back to a moment in their life whether it be happy or sad — like a time capsule
I think it’s because in life — and especially in my life — you have those fleeting moments where it’s like I could not be more happy than I am right now It’s the same when you have one of your favorite flowers
It’s pretty but it’s only going to be like that for one or two days so hold onto that moment Enjoy it while it’s beautiful because it doesn’t last forever
I feel super lucky to live in this time when flowers are so extremely popular
When I moved to Paris in and started working with the Four Seasons George V Hotel we revolutionized the way people thought of flowers — showing them in a really clean simple chic way
Very monochromatic all one type bunched together coming out of the base and floating

Styles have changed over the years it’s kind of like fashion in that way… everyone just chooses what best suits their personality
Flowers have also become such a statement of wealth — a status symbol like pulling up in a really nice car at a wedding
How many flowers can you have to prove how much money you have
Those days I refer to as The Golden Years You had everyone — from Karl Lagerfeld to Lee McQueen and Tom Ford Marc Jacobs when he was at Louis Vuitton — at the full height and bloom of their career
That really did shape who I was as an artist because that was a time when anything goes
There were big budgets and big creativity
I remember especially going to McQueen shows — they were just so out of this world and creative
Pardon my French but he didn’t give a fuck
He was pushing the boundaries of design that really did influence me and still does — because I feel like that does not exist in fashion anymore
Now it’s like how many bags and sunglasses and shoes can we sell rather than say let’s make a dress out of seashells
Back then when I was experimenting I remember using live birds and butterflies and different things in my work just to push my boundaries
Some of it was successful and some of it failed but that really made me a better artist
Well my relationship started with her mom Kris Jenner
She has taught me a lot because she’s always had such amazing taste and such amazing style
Kimberly also has such a love of art and fashion she always wants to be on that cutting edge but in a classic way
I love working with her because she’s always open to doing different things
She’s always sending me photographs like what if we did something like this but made it our own I love the way that she pushes me as a designer
They’re great friends and they’re great clients
We’re very similar in our love of photography and fashion and especially with Kim a love of architecture now
Which for me is interesting because a lot of what I do with flowers has to do with architecture
I think the architectural aspect of my work really started because I had no idea what I was getting myself into with the George V hotel when I started there
It’s just so heavy and French and classical I was like I have to do something here that’s the total opposite of this so that my work actually gets noticed and doesn’t just fade away into the tapestries
that’s when I started to work very architecturally the flowers in bold colors very strong bold lines
And then I won out in the end because all the heavy furniture in the lobby got taken away
Take away the furniture put in more flowers
