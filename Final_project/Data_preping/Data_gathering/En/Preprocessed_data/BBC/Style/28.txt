In an unexpected phone call from an American attorney turned Claire Gimpel’s world on its axis
The lawyer — Laurence Eisenstein whose firm works to recover artwork looted by the Nazis — said he’d been speaking to a British scholar who’d come across the name Ren Gimpel in art collectors’ archives
Ren was Claire’s grandfather a French Jewish resistance fighter killed in a German concentration camp
Eisenstein told Claire that he and Ian Locke a researcher who has studied and written about post-war restitutions believed the Nazis had stolen a substantial art collection from her grandfather
While the Gimpels knew Ren was a renowned art dealer before World War II they were oblivious to the extent of his collection
We were never told anything about my grandfather other than that he was in the French resistance
Certainly not that he had been robbed Claire told CNN in a phone interview adding He didn’t hide during the war
In my family he’s considered a hero
For Claire a now--year-old Jewish French woman living in Paris it was the beginning of a -year battle to track down her grandfather’s stolen art including precious paintings by th-century Fauvist artist Andr Derain and another by the Impressionist master Claude Monet
As well as being a famous gallerist of his time Ren Gimpel was a very well-connected man
Closely related to the Vuitton family his mother Clarisse Vuitton was Louis Vuitton’s niece Ren socialized with artists such as Monet Georges Braque Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso and bonded with acclaimed writer Marcel Proust who became a close friend over their shared passion for the work of the artist Johannes Vermeer
Ren closed his Paris gallery in for unknown reasons
After the Germans entered the city on June Ren who under the laws of Vichy France was of Jewish race fled with his wife to Cannes and then Monte Carlo leaving his housekeeper Odile Firer to handle his affairs in Paris
Despite the risks Ren chose to join the Resistance Arrested twice — first by the French Vichy regime which let him go and then by the German Gestapo who took him as a political prisoner — Ren was deported to Neuengamme a concentration camp near Hamburg He died there in
A Jewish family fleeing the Nazis sold a Picasso in
During Claire’s conversation with Eisenstein in the lawyer revealed that Ren’s substantial portfolio had been divided up and spread across Europe — sold at auctions housed in private collections and even put on display in museums
We had no idea recalled Claire explaining that by using online family archives — ledgers correspondence and photographs Ren was a prodigious journal keeper — Locke had compiled a -line spreadsheet of objects he believed were plundered from her family
In some cases Claire said one line represented not only one item but a cache of multiple objects such as a set of engravings containing pieces dating from the Middle Ages through to the Renaissance That means tens of thousands of art objects have disappeared Claire said
The list was the beginning of the Gimpel heirs’ fight to recover her grandfather’s collection and for Claire the mission held a special kind of urgency
I’m getting old she said adding that she fears the day when no-one who remembers her grandfather remains alive We have to finish this quickly because people like me are all going to die
After us there won’t really be anyone left to search for the property and return it to the families
Precisely what happened to Ren’s artworks during the war remains unclear but court filings state that in his Paris apartment — at Place du Palais Bourbon — was confiscated and looted by the German embassy as were crates of artworks he had placed in storage
In the Gestapo seized more of his property from a bank safe in Nice
Family archives also supported the five Gimpel heirs’ belief that their grandfather was forced to sell pieces of art to survive after the Nazis occupied France
A decree of April forbade Jews from working in the commercial sector stateless in hiding and without bank accounts Ren would have had no other way to financially support his family or the resistance network
Early in their search the Gimpels learned through family records that Ren bought six Andr Derain paintings at auction in With help from Locke and Eisenstein they identified three of those paintings on display in museums in France
Two of them Paysage Cassis and La Chapelle-sous-Crcy were tracked down to a public museum in Troyes northeastern France another Pinde Cassis was discovered in a museum in Marseille
All had been on display for years
Court documents seen by CNN show that in the Gimpel heirs submitted a claim to the Ministry of Culture for the restitution of the three Derain paintings
In an email to CNN the French Ministry of Culture acknowledged Ren’s assets had been stolen forcibly sold or confiscated during the war and said the family had been compensated for some of their lost property The family confirmed to CNN that they applied for and received compensation from the German and French governments via a joint restitutions scheme though they declined to specify the amount
Seven intimate Egon Schiele artworks looted by the Nazis from a Jewish art collector are returned to his heirs
But the emailed statement went on to say that the ministry did not have enough information on the whereabouts of the works or proof that they had been stolen from Ren Gimpel to return the three Derain paintings
At an impasse the Gimpel family turned to Corinne Hershkovitch a French lawyer with decades of experience helping families to retrieve their stolen artworks including five looted paintings hanging in the Louvre that were returned to the Jewish family from which they were stolen in — a move that set a precedent in France This case became very emblematic for me because everyone wanted to forget the unprecedented looting that was perpetrated at the time of the war Hershkovitch said of the returns
In the Gimpel heirs went to court to recoup the Derain paintings
But proving that the artworks had been stolen by the Nazis nearly years earlier posed a challenge
It’s like a police or journalistic investigation but you can’t interview the witnesses said art provenance researcher Margaux Dumas a PhD candidate at both University Paris-Diderot and the Technical University Berlin who worked with the family in their fight for restitution
A photograph taken in Ren’s Paris living room became a critical piece of evidence
Captured sometime between and it showed the three Derain paintings in question hanging on the art dealer’s wall
It was the proof Paris Criminal Court needed to corroborate that Claire’s grandfather had once owned them
Proving the artworks were later stolen however was much harder
Supported by family archives the five Gimpel heirs were adamant the Derain paintings were sold under duress when the Vichy regime’s antisemitic policies left Ren in need of money But without an invoice or deed of sale the French Ministry of Culture and the two museums argued that evidence of this was insufficient
You obviously can’t have a deed of sale because these sales were done under the table Claire said
In August the Paris Criminal Court ruled in favor of the French government and the museums stating that proof the three paintings were forcibly sold or confiscated cannot be established with certainty
But a year later the French Court of Appeals overturned this judgment
According to a letter dating from that was found in the family archives and seen by CNN Ren instructed his housekeeper Odile Firer to look after my friend Derain who is a valuable man who must not be let down which the court interpreted as a request to sell the paintings
In its decision the appeals court wrote that there are precise serious and concordant indications that the Derain paintings were taken illegally or purchased under duress thus making their sale null and void
It was the first time a court had ruled that families seeking restitution should not be expected to produce evidence that was too difficult to obtain considering the context in which the pieces were taken
France set to return a Klimt and other Nazi-pillaged artworks to Jewish families
In seven years after they began their fight the Gimpel heirs were finally reunited with the three Derain paintings
When asked by CNN why it had taken so long to return the artworks the Troyes museum said that since the paintings were part of national collections they could not be returned to the Gimpel heirs without a court ruling The city of Marseille said that the return of Derain’s work was one of the first measures taken by the Mayor of Marseille Benot Payan at the start of his term of office in — although with a court ruling in place Payan had been compelled to do so
Despite the lengthy legal battle Dumas said the Gimpel heirs were somewhat lucky as they could rely on extensive family archives — and because artworks that end up in museums are easier to track down
Dumas said this is often not the case for Jewish families trying to recover their ancestors’ stolen art
The Nazis systematically emptied the houses of Jewish people who had fled or been deported meaning the scale of looting goes far beyond art
There are testimonies that they stole everything right down to the electrical outlets the wallpaper explained Dumas adding that in Paris alone she believes apartments were emptied
Hershkovitch has also handled cases involving furniture books musical instruments and monetary losses
The French Ministry of Culture estimates that seizures of Jewish art collectors and dealers resulted in approximately works looted from more than people in France and Belgium between July and August
The ministry also states that claims made to the Artistic Recovery Commission which operated between November and December to assist the recovery of lost pieces total around works and works of art approximately of which were returned to their rightful owners between and
You have to understand that we’re not in a dialogue at all we’re in a battle Hershkovitch told CNN of her efforts to reunite families with their stolen possessions
But it’s a fight that has she said become easier thanks to changing public opinion — and the Gimpel court ruling three years ago
In the French government declared its mission to restitute cultural belongings that were stolen forcibly sold or confiscated between and regardless of whether they were looted in France or are simply now located in France
The French parliament adopted a new law streamlining the complex restitution process in July
It took us four years to get photos of the backs of the paintings usually one of the first places to look for identifying labels tags or marks when checking provenance from the museums
Now if you ask for a photo of the back of a painting you get it within six months
Today the five Gimpel heirs have recovered six paintings including a fourth Derain and one Monet from French museums and private owners
They’re still working to acquire hundreds of other artworks they also believe were stolen While Claire admits there is little chance they will find everything she is encouraged by their progress
Sure it’s years since the end of World War II
