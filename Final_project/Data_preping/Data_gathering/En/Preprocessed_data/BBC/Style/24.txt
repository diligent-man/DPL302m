in march florida gov
ron desantis appeared onstage alongside a page from the picture book call me max blown up on a piece of poster board
the page showed a child lying outside on the grass on their tummy next to a snoozing dog
the child looked contemplative their hand propping up their cheek
when i was born my mom and dad said it s a girl
when i looked in the mirror i saw a girl
kind of
but because i m transgender i wanted to see a boy
desantis held up the page as an example of a book that wasn t appropriate for any place but certainly not in the state of florida
minutes later he signed florida s parental rights in education bill better known by its critics as the don t say gay bill which prohibited classroom instruction about sexuality and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade
earlier this year the state expanded the law to ban teaching those topics in all public schools through th grade
the bill s passage made national headlines enraging parents who opposed censorship and inspiring others to take up a similar cause in their children s schools
as a result books like call me max have been challenged or outright removed from schools and libraries in florida as well as other states and though some believe book bans lead to more book sales authors say the effect of those bans is devastating for their careers
kyle lukoff the author of call me max and the newbery honor book too bright to see among others said the national publicity did little to nothing to improve sales of max instead it introduced his work to people who want to remove it from bookshelves in their local schools and libraries
i ve had this said to me many times i wish my book would get banned because that s the best way to get it on the best seller list lukoff said in a phone interview
that certainly never happened for me
lukoff hasn t yet earned royalties from call me max or the other two books in its series he said
his advances were per book and he won t earn those royalties until all of them earn the money back
lukoff s experience and the experiences of hundreds of authors whose books have been banned in the last school year contradicts a common refrain among some authors and anti censorship proponents that banning a book results in a sales surge
when books get banned even when authors do see a spike in sales it is much more devastating for careers in the long run lukoff said
if your book is kept out of libraries and schools in entire states that does translate to a long term consistent drop in sales
phil bildner a children s book author and advocate for fellow writers said that having a book banned is not a badge of honor
i still don t think most people grasp just how financially devastating this book banning era is to queer authors and authors from marginalized communities said bildner who runs the author village a group that represents authors and illustrators for school visits
and i know most people don t grasp the emotional toll it s having on the authors in the crosshairs
up until recently a list of banned books was a blend of the usual suspects the catcher in the rye to kill a mockingbird the bluest eye and newer favorites like the hate u give and thirteen reasons why
but book bans have surged in the last year
pen america an organization that supports and protects first amendment rights for writers journalists and other communicators reported that more than books were banned in the school year a increase from the previous school year
these bans overwhelmingly target books about race and racism as well as books with lgbtq characters pen america said in its september study on school book bans
there are concentrated efforts from groups like moms for liberty and laverna in the library an offshoot of utah parents united to ban dozens of books at once
these groups compile comprehensive lists of books that contain what these groups point to as objectionable material
websites like rated books and booklooks grade books based on their content and highlight potentially objectionable paragraphs on their sites posting entire pages out of context
vocal individuals have also had immense power in banning books the washington post reported in may that of book challenges in the school year came from just people
larger groups also share instructions for individuals on how to get books banned and what to say at school board meetings typically parents will read controversial excerpts aloud
when we look at books and obscenity we have to look at the whole book said tasslyn magnusson a program consultant with freedom to read at pen america who tracks banned books and works with authors whose works have been removed from schools and libraries
magnusson pointed to books like speak laurie halse anderson s frequently challenged novel about a high schooler who after being raped works through her trauma in an art class and george m
johnson s all boys aren t blue a memoir manifesto which contains scenes of sexual assault
sexual content explicit language and disturbing content may appear in those books but they re appropriate in context magnusson said
deborah caldwell stone director of the american library association s office for intellectual freedom said it s within parents rights to choose certain books for their kids and avoid others
but no one group no one parent should dictate what s available for other families she said
everyone deserves the freedom to find a wide range of ideas in a library they re there to serve everyone in a community she said
many of the authors interviewed noted that a ban can boost sales of a book angie thomas the author of the hate u give has said that every time that book is banned in a school district the sales in that area skyrocket
this was the case with maus art spiegelman s pulitzer prize winning graphic novel about the holocaust
in january a tennessee school board banned the title for inappropriate words and a partially obscured image of a nude woman
those protesting the decision bought maus in droves until it was backordered for months
it topped amazon s list of best sellers and bookscan a publishing industry tool that tracks book sales across the country reported that sales of maus jumped between the first week of january to the last
but soaring sales are not common authors said and it s increasingly rare now that hundreds of books are being banned at once
it s hard to explain why it works when it works but it s a fluke it s not the pattern magnusson said
the pattern is that this has a devastating impact on current and future income
libraries and schools account for a massive chunk of all children s literature sales magnusson said
so if libraries across a state particularly those in states with some of the largest school districts opt not to buy a book that could effectively put a book out of print lukoff said
bookscan and the association of american publishers told cnn they did not have data that was granular enough to provide insight into how book bans affect subsequent sales
when a group or parent sets out to ban a book they often target both well known books and works from independent presses or authors with less name recognition
books by lesser known authors like juno dawson s this book is gay or mike curato s flamer are often bundled with hits like speak or john green s looking for alaska both of which were adapted into films
those less familiar works may not appear in a bookstore or library s banned books display said samira ahmed an author who said her book internment has been soft banned or removed from shelves by school staff without a formal challenge
the sheer number of banned books makes it nearly impossible for a maus like breakout
there were more than book bans in florida alone last school year as pen america reported
building a movement to buy all of them in a show of support isn t feasible lukoff said
a book ban would make news and people would say i ll buy this book just to show them lukoff said of the once common result of book bans
now that it s an entire movement to ban books that s not a sustainable response
when books for young people don t sell well within school districts they re not likely to get a paperback release lukoff said
books just kind of disappear
writing books for children is far from glitzy or reliable work magnusson said
while advance rates for picture books and middle grade books are relatively opaque to the public she said she s heard from authors whose advances are a few thousand dollars around the same as lukoff s were for the max series and many of those advances haven t earned out
it s not a lucrative job by any means she said
because publishing alone isn t a guaranteed windfall many authors who write for young people rely on school visits and other paid appearances at literary conferences or libraries to make a steady income magnusson said
this school year some of those offers have been rescinded or were never proposed ahmed said her number of school visits have dwindled to just three this year bildner said several queer authors he knows are also down to three or four visits a year when they typically did to
these opportunities are now virtually nonexistent bildner said of paid visits particularly for lgbtq authors
being banned can also hurt an author s future prospects
caldwell stone said that publishers might be wary of buying a manuscript from an author whose works have been tagged as controversial
and it might be even more difficult for lower profile authors to weather these bans lukoff said particularly without the backing of a major publishing house or the name recognition of authors like j k
rowling harper lee or art spiegelman
everyone knows about maus he said
it s much harder for a random queer or trans person or a person of color whose debut has just gotten swept up in all of this
and it s possible said caldwell stone that publishers may not be as willing to offer contracts to new authors whose subjects have been deemed controversial particularly topics like race and racism or lgbtq life
there are definitely fears that now putting money into books that are likely to get banned is a losing proposition financially for publishing houses lukoff said
it makes an already hard proposition that much harder
because the market for books about subjects like racism and lgbtq life is uncertain those unknowns may drive authors not to write at all or to write something other than the subjects they re passionate about all to ensure they can make a living said torrey maldonado author of what lane which has been cited frequently as a useful guide to antiracism for young people
there are authors and illustrators who think if this is going to be blocked maybe i should do something else or maybe i should create something else maldonado said
book banning threatens to stamp out people s fire
it s taken so much work to begin to shift publishing to be more representative of who people are magnusson said
that work has been severely attacked here
and the parents who challenge these books at school boards have sometimes targeted the authors themselves
ahmed said she knows several authors who ve been doxxed threatened and called horrific slurs by critics who challenge their work
people who specifically create a career to write for young people they re spending so much time thinking about their audience what did i not have to read when i was a young person magnusson said
children s authors especially spend so much time connecting to their inner child that to be called pedophiles sexual deviants sent hate mail that has a psychological and emotional impact that is pretty profound
ahmed said it s a slap in the face to see my work categorized as profane or obscene when she writes specifically for young people
it s exhausting too for authors who didn t plan to fight book bans regularly
lukoff said his first high profile bans occurred in early in austin and salt lake city when book bans first started to accelerate
the volume of bans has only gotten worse he said and it s started to define his work
it is so unrelenting he said
i m not surprised that my books have been banned i m surprised this has become a much larger inescapable political movement
book bans are not new noted maldonado
they re a political tool of domination he said to silence certain voices and points of view particularly when those points of view come from a person of color or someone who identifies as lgbtq
it s not just our work being condemned it s us personally it s our identities ahmed said
the very real goal of book bans is to erase identities from the shelves a campaign led by fear and hate under the guise of parental rights
and the reaction to book bans could see publishers take a major step back in terms of supporting inclusive literature magnusson said
it s taken so much work to begin to shift publishing to be more representative of who people are magnusson said
that work has been severely attacked here
ultimately those who lose the most when a book is banned are the authors who write for children and the children who may never have a chance to read those works in their schools or local libraries said ahmed
there have been thousands of challenges across america and what that actually means is that young people are being denied the opportunity and access to these books she said
