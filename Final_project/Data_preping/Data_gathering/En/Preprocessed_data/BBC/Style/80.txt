in the round of at this year s us open tennis championships in flushing new york the number ranked borna gojo played the formidable second seed novak djokovic
against someone as decorated and famous as djokovic many a player finds himself overshadowed novak is a time grand slam winner
he s been a star for decades
he pulls a lot of eyes
yet though gojo lost he too left a strong impression on account of not only his bullet fast groundstrokes but also his close cropped platinum blond hair
such was the croatian s presence underscored by the flaxen buzzcut that the us open s own editorial team labeled his verve the mojo of gojo
gojo s is one example in a long line of hairstyles in complement to tennis a sport in which style is often in the spotlight
its players are competing individually and are not beholden to a uniform outside of their sponsors demands though at wimbledon they do have to wear all white
as a result the tennis aesthetic head to toe is varied and dynamic
look of the week serena williams bedazzled us open outfit
pop culture emblazoned hair moments in the sport include to name just a few venus williams beaded braids at her us open debut and her sister serena s similar style two years later andre agassi s mullet masterpiece a wig roger federer s one time ponytail and billie jean king s close kept cut
and if there s a science to this a confluence of high threshold performance and identity carving in the arena of athlete celebrity a man named julien farel has the formula
a renowned hairstylist originally from france farel today owns namesake salons in new york city and palm beach florida where cuts can run clients up to
at the us open farel s namesake venture has been a well kept semi secret among players for years every august and into september farel s salon pops up at the tournament s flagship arthur ashe stadium providing free cuts and services to the tournament s competitors
the public is not allowed in it s strictly for athletes
it doesn t matter if your hair is long or short dyed or natural said farel speaking from his manhattan outpost
what is important is to be prepared
and this includes your presentation
preparation must go into a great performance
in today s world in any industry it s the same thing
the salon itself is situated just outside of the players locker room area an easy drop in by design
as this year marks farel s th installation the slogan love a tennis scoring phrase is displayed in the functional frill free room
farel and his staff offer cuts pedicures and manicures
hair color services are not allowed however as the chemicals required are not permitted on the grounds
in recent days players including austin krajicek who is seeded first in mixed doubles alongside the world number women s player jessica pegula magdalena fr ch and more had stopped in for trims
farel s salon at arthur ashe does not take appointments
it is walk in only and staffers are around when farel himself is not on site
this set up gives the place a sense of anticipation you never know when someone will pop by
nor who and the names can be and have been career boosting for farel
the best moment for me was when i cut rafael nadal s hair in from long to short farel told cnn
that year he won the tournament one of tennis best ever names nadal has won grand slams though he s currently recovering from surgery and not playing at the us open
when i cut his hair the following days or weeks people would ask me can you sell me a piece farel added
i m telling you it s crazy
does farel have a preference for hairstyles when it comes to tennis
i like long hair for men
i like sascha zverev s hair and stefanos tsitsipas
it s the kind of haircut i will always embrace because i like to see hair he said
zverev in particular has earned a nickname for his mane the lion
for women i always love bangs and layers on long hair farel continued
he cited gabriela sabatini s long waves of the s and s and mentioned caroline wozniacki s braided pony at this year s open
a number of young and rising stars like coco gauff and carlos alcaraz have recently altered their hair too
alcaraz was spotted after his wimbledon win with a close shave on the side longer on the top which has since grown in gauff went from box braids to cornrows that flow into a bun earlier this year
i like to change up my hair she told reporters at august s mubadala city open in washington d c
i ve tried color in the past with the braids but i just needed something different
of this younger cohort around which there s much buzz in the tennis world farel said there s plenty of time to establish one s visual brand or to keep evolving it
it s ok to play and to change especially because they re young
i remember jimmy connors with his beatles haircut and martina navratilova s bowl cut
it was the same style over and over again
but nowadays i think players can change up their look more freely
and you ll see the result of this elsewhere too people are looking to these athletes for inspiration
