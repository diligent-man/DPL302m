The Nobel Prize in literature has been awarded to Jon Fosse for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable the Swedish Academy announced in Stockholm on Thursday
Fosse was born on the west coast of Norway
His work consists of around plays as well as a number of novels poetry essays children’s books and translations
The committee lauded the author’s style which has come to be known as Fosse minimalism
Fosse presents everyday situations that are instantly recognizable in our own lives
His radical reduction of language and dramatic action expresses the most powerful human emotions of anxiety and powerlessness in the simplest terms the committee said
His magnum opus seven sections in three books grouped together into a single volume titled Septology tells the story of an aging painter and widower who lives alone as he reckons with the realities of religion identity art and family life
Septology has been praised for its formal experimentation
Fosse’s meditative prose is rarely interrupted by periods creating an incantatory flow to his philosophical interrogation
And I see myself standing and looking at the picture with the two lines that cross in the middle one purple line one brown line it’s a painting wider than it is high and I see that I’ve painted the lines slowly the novel begins continuing slowly but breathlessly for almost pages
The three individual books comprising Septology The Other Name I is Another and A New Name tell a story that unfurls over seven days
The work progresses seemingly endlessly and without sentence breaks but is formally held together by recurring themes and ritual gestures of prayer Anders Olsson chair of Nobel committee said at the announcement news conference on Thursday
The novel details the struggle of Asle the narrator to complete his painting and compares him throughout to another Asle who is also a painter but is consumed by alcohol who functions as his doppelganger
The novel asks how we become the people we become by staging two versions of the same person against one another
The Septology is a major work being at the same time a reconciliation with his own fate an elegy to his dead wife and a Kunstlerroman dealing with his own career as a painter said Olsson
Fosse combines strong local ties both linguistic and geographic with modernist artistic techniques the committee said listing the Irish playwright Samuel Beckett and the Austrian poet Georg Trakl among those who influenced his style
While Fosse shares the negative outlook of his predecessors his particular gnostic vision cannot be said to result in a nihilistic contempt of the world
Indeed there is great warmth and humor in his work and a naive vulnerability to his stark images of human experience the committee added
Annie Ernaux won the Nobel Prize in literature for her 'uncompromising' work on family class and gender
Fosse’s award marks the latest coup for Fitzcarraldo Editions an independent London-based publisher founded in which has now added a fifth Nobel Prize-winning author to its ranks
In the past nine years four writers published by Fitzcarraldo have won the Nobel Prize including Fosse then Svetlana Alexievich in Olga Tokarczuk in and Annie Ernaux in
Fitzcarraldo also publish translations of Elfriede Jelinek who won the award in
But the choice of Fosse as this year’s laureate will do little to counter criticism from those who say the committee rewards European writers at the expense of authors in other continents
Male writers have also historically dominated the award Of the laureates in literature only have been women
