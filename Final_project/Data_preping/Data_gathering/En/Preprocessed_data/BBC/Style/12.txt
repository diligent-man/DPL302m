cnn in the ad campaign for loewe s latest paula s ibiza collection the singer karol g is seen emerging from the sea in a white slip dress waves reflected in sunglasses that set off her then flame red hair as she gazes into the horizon
the image captured on colombia s caribbean coast has a mythical quality that somehow reveals the pensive songwriter behind the high octane performer
jonathan anderson loewe s creative director wanted it shot in the musician s home country she said to capture the entire karol g vibe
it is a vibe that has spread like wildfire in the last year
in february karol s fourth studio album ma ana ser bonito tomorrow will be beautiful became the first spanish language album by a woman to debut at number one on the us billboard chart
last month she won an mtv video music award for her collaboration with shakira for their track tqg today she is the female artist with the most spanish songs on the billboard hot
look of the week shakira s no jacket is a big mood
the new queen of reggaeton a dance ready style of music dominating the airwaves with its mix of reggae rap and dembow beats infused with pop karol g is a household name across much of latin america
but some of her biggest hits including provenza and tusa a duet with nicki minaj have helped the genre strike a chord with audiences all over the world cementing her newfound status as a global pop sensation
and in navigating her way through the notoriously tricky music industry karol has managed to cultivate an image and a sphere of influence that have been noticed by forward thinking brands in an equally tricky industry fashion
karol g is one of the biggest stars in contemporary latin music and her bold eye catching style is a major part of her persona said charlie smith chief marketing and communications officer at loewe which was the first luxury brand to cast her as a campaign model
she has a huge global following thanks to the way she brings her own twist to reggaeton and has brought the style of music to new audiences around the world
loewe s decision to tap the reggaeton star appears to have paid off
on instagram the response to karol s post of the campaign clocked up more than three million likes and million in media impact value miv for the brand according to launchmetrics a data analytics firm
the campaign which was revealed in april couldn t have come at a better moment for the lvmh owned brand karol g may have been relatively unknown to the wider fashion establishment but her music career was about to go into overdrive fueled by an increasingly passionate and devoted fanbase
after a june televised performance for the today show outside new york city s rockefeller center producers of the show revealed that the crowds for karol s appearance swelled to a size larger than any other in memory including those for latin music legend ricky martin s landmark performance
two months later billboard announced that karol made history as the female with the most entries on its hot latin songs chart a ranking which has been around for more than three decades
no wonder rolling stone magazine gave her its september cover
but if as the magazine s strapline suggests karol does now feel fearless and free in the music industry that hasn t always embraced her then her feelings for the fashion industry have yet to follow
i ve never been best friends with fashion so to speak confided karol expressing as much surprise as delight that her big break in fashion would come from a highly conceptual designer like anderson and a luxury brand at the scale of loewe
fashion can be awkward
my style just goes with the flow
the pairing isn t entirely obvious
in recent years loewe has been rejuvenated by anderson s surrealist craft infused approach pushing annual sales within striking distance of billion billion according to market sources
but it remains one of spain s most iconic heritage brands having traded on its elite status and discreetly opulent aesthetic since
karol g s image is far more exuberant and accessible
before that i felt like no one saw me as a fashion related figure because i never got clothing from brands and when we approached them it didn t work out recalled karol explaining that she usually had to buy what she wanted at retailers instead of having brands offer to lend the latest season s pieces a publicity perk that other musicians of her caliber readily enjoyed
it took me a long time to experience that
but if karol still sees herself as a fashion outsider her power as an influencer has become clear to savvy fashion insiders
a ranking of the top instagram accounts compiled by socialbook a company connecting creators and brands through influencer marketing shows that karol g s engagement rates are significantly higher than some of her contemporaries
with million followers on the platform karol g ranks th in terms of follower count but th when it comes to engagement rates
in early october her day engagement rate was higher than that of k pop boy band bts whose members have numerous luxury brand ambassadorships and hollywood star zendaya
to put this into context kim kardashian has more than five times the followers as karol g but karol s percent engagement rate dwarfs kardashian s percent rate over the same period
forever young beautiful and scandal free the rise of south korea s virtual influencers
a good or impressive engagement rate is anything close to or above percent said julian martinez creative director at socialbook
a high engagement rate means you are doing something right with your audience and captivating their emotions one way or another martinez added
there are many factors and variables present so it s hard to isolate the exact cause
however whatever karol g is doing with her posts and content she s doing a great job
celebrity marketing can pay dividends in brand awareness and affinity but it can also directly drive sales of specific items when fans are compelled to imitate their idol s style
karol g closet is just one of many social media accounts that chronicles karol s wardrobe like a shopping guide complete with product shots and prices for the balenciaga shoes miaou corsets and miu miu skirts she has been spotted wearing
at last year s coachella for example where she wore a roberto cavalli costume to sing a medley of classics by latin music artists a wave of color emerged from the crowd as throngs of fans paid tribute to the singer s blue era hair by wearing wigs of the same colour
that was a surprise she said
brands almost never release figures to prove that a campaign model was a good return on investment and rarely use that sort of language when they do comment
loewe is no different
but the label s enthusiasm for its karol g campaign a half year after its release is telling nonetheless
the collaboration was extremely successful said loewe s smith citing the million impressions her campaign post yielded on social media and the commercial success of the sunglasses she wore in the campaign
predictably the loewe partnership brought karol to the attention of other brands
working with loewe opened the door to everything else happening now
after that we got invitations from many other designers fashion magazines and runway shows she said
in june karol was invited by jacquemus to sit front row at the french brand s palace of versailles show wearing an off the shoulder gown
that made a lot of noise she recalled
at the los angeles barbie premiere the movie s soundtrack includes her track watati a month later emilio pucci dressed her in a halter neck crop top and maxi skirt for the pink carpet
was this the wildest barbie premiere so far
you know i never thought that being faithful to who i was not following what s in or out of fashion and not having to change myself to get there would bring me such a platform said karol noting that most of her recent fashion industry encounters have helped her stay true to her style but do so in a way that makes it look more elevated
her style has definitely undergone an evolution over the past seven years she s been in the public eye
streetwear wardrobe staples like joggers trainers and caps still make an occasional appearance but now they re coordinated with embellished tops lingerie inspired loungewear or sultry frocks
vetements and rick owens are among the labels that pique her interest these days but she won t lock herself into any look that s reliant on specific brands just yet
i want to keep experimenting she said
that doesn t mean she s not conscious of the need to paint her image with a degree of consistency
to that end she s made colorful hair a trademark often alternating between pastels and jewel tones
she keeps returning to a few style themes too a tactic that makes it clear she is the one wearing the brand not the brand wearing her
karol has described her emerging signature look as a mermaid who s a tomboy at heart that duality looms large in the outfits she wore for tusa for example
the video for that song framed her wearing an ethereal floor length gown next to mythical creatures like a pegasus her performance of the song at the latin grammys saw her command the stage in bejeweled off road motorcycle racing trousers
but no matter which direction the winds of fashion may be blowing she said some items are sacred like hoop earrings which she insists she will never abandon because they symbolize her roots in colombia s urban street culture
i won t stop doing something that truly represents me she said
i m very careful about that
perhaps it s down to the fact that she is still in awe of her own successes but karol is prone to a bit of gushing albeit in a tone that sounds more humble than sycophantic
it makes sense that she s hugely grateful to anderson for the loewe gig
being associated with the elite high concept luxury brand could help set her apart from other female reggaeton stars in the eyes of the fashion industry
why then did it take high fashion so long to notice her
it s true that her recent ascent has been steeper than most but by karol g had already secured her third consecutive year as the most streamed latin american female worldwide on spotify
she has been huge in the region where most big luxury brands have stores in at least a few major markets for years
and beyond the us and spain where she s been well known for a while her music has been streamed in the millions in countries like france italy germany and canada according to maykol sanchez spotify s head of artists and label partnerships for the latin america and us latin markets
one reason for the lag in recognition is that until the s big brands were mostly focused on male musicians who traditionally dominated the reggaeton genre
daddy yankee s partnership with reebok and don omar s with umbro set an early precedent
by the time karol g entered the scene in a big way fashion luxury and sportswear giants were still warming up to her male counterparts
in recent years maluma teamed up with dolce gabbana and balmain j balvin with nike and guess bad bunny with jacquemus and adidas and nicky jam with hublot
opinion bad bunny s politically charged reggaet n is making waves
ivy queen often credited as the original reggaeton queen was a notable exception in those early male dominated years of the genre capturing attention with her female empowerment anthems
but it wasn t until after the male wave of partnerships that women began landing global fashion and beauty contracts
trailblazers in the broader latin music scene like jennifer lopez and shakira who last year fronted a holiday campaign for burberry had laid the groundwork for them
anitta brazil s funk carioca pop star who dabbles in reggaeton in both portuguese and spanish has starred in campaigns for levi s and dolce gabbana among others
barcelona native rosal a whose musical versatility has made some of her hits reggaeton chart toppers became the face of acne studios last year while genre defying mexican american artist becky g who recorded the hit mamiii with karol has collaborated with pretty little thing
karol herself scored a couple collaborations with brands before loewe notably kappa and crocs
but even these early movers were a bit late to the reggaeton party
the origins of reggaeton can be traced back to panama in the s as a form of reggae in spanish where the genre drew musical inspiration from jamaica before evolving in puerto rico
it blossomed in the s and early s as it blended with american hip hop dominican dembow and other caribbean musical genres rooted in the african diaspora
many of its early artists took style cues from us rappers of the time albeit with a distinctive latin streetwear edge
the year old male model with the face of a classic cinema star
in the s reggaeton found resonance in karol g s hometown of medell n colombia and the city soon became a creative capital for the scene
in her debut album unstoppable co produced with longtime friend and collaborator ovy emerged as a sensation
one track ahora me llama now he calls me which featured the then rising puerto rican rapper bad bunny catapulted her to stardom across latin america and in communities in the us where nearly one in five people are of latin american heritage according to the pew research center
as some artists distanced themselves from reggaeton s heavier rap origins and industrial clanks a more commercial and melodic sound started gaining traction in cities like miami mexico city and even as far afield as buenos aires and santiago chile where local musicians put their own spin on it
the once underground genre had gone mainstream and so too had karol g
karol was booming after the pandemic hit
her music was all over the radio stations here in mexico
she had already taken off in our world but we knew she was about to explode globally so we wanted her says karla mart nez head of content for vogue mexico and latin america which featured her on the cover of the magazine early last year
today reggaeton s reach goes much further than its strongholds in latin america north america and europe
not only have record labels in dubai opened latin music divisions for reggaeton artists to tap middle eastern markets but nightclubs in asian cities like singapore now promote reggaeton dance nights and new musical hybrids fusing local genres with reggaeton can be heard on radio stations around the world including african cities like nairobi
but the increasingly global appeal of artists like karol g is not just a product of reggaeton
it is down to the rise of spanish language music more broadly
according to data from spotify latin music streams have surged by nearly percent worldwide over the past five years with the category s presence in the spotify global top witnessing a remarkable percent growth
there s been an explosion of latin music all around the world led by reggaeton but it s all different genres said colombia born leila cobo billboard s chief content officer for latin and espa ol adding that it has been bolstered by music streaming services reshaping a market where there aren t as many gatekeepers as before
the music itself is more professional and better produced now too cobo added
audiences react to the rhythm even if they don t speak the language
people aren t as fixated on that anymore
indeed it is the shift in attitudes toward language that appears to have helped karol g secure the loewe deal
jonathan anderson told me that even though he didn t understand what my lyrics were saying that the music had a quality that just made him feel good karol said
born carolina giraldo navarro karol auditioned for colombia s x factor as a year old but didn t get far
during her teens she sang at quincea era coming of age parties alongside j balvin before either made it big
she spent years gigging before signing with a puerto rican label that brought few successes
at a low point she relocated to new york and nearly abandoned her music career aspirations
how soul train immortalized an exuberant era of black style and culture
karol worked hard said cobo noting that now at age she s mature and has built her success from the ground up
she has remained grounded throughout her career openly discussing her struggles
i think that women see her and say there is a superstar who is like me
besides karol s not just a reggaeton artist anymore
she s become a pop artist she added
being an ambassador of latin american music and culture doesn t come without pressure
although karol has called herself a bichota a gendered riff on the puerto rican slang for a big shot that she reinterpreted as a daring empowered berraca badass woman in her song of the same title she readily confesses her insecurities
it scares me to think tomorrow i could make a mistake and everything could turn against me she said before hastening to add but i can t let that dominate my focus
karol explained that since the album ma ana sera bonito she s been more transparent about her life including intimate topics like sexuality and family
i believe that a big part of the connection i have with my audience has been realness like showing my life without filters she said
i ve been open and exposed
i haven t tried to hide it in any way
i m looking for ways to i don t know internalize it all and say this is my moment this is how i am look at me
it s true that karol admits the kind of things that others in her position might try to hide even comparatively trivial episodes like how daunting she finds it to navigate the fashion industry s glamorous events
i feel a bit out of my comfort zone there
when i see celebrities and artists in those situations she explained
there s a certain etiquette
i don t know how to stand what to say how to speak but at the end of the day i try to relax and enjoy the experience
but it s precisely this raw unpretentious charm that seems to make her alluring to fans and collaborators alike
she s an artist who has become a role model for millions and not been afraid to show her vulnerabilities through her music said nina garc a editor in chief of the american edition of elle explaining that the decision to feature her on the magazine s cover was a no brainer
her message of a better day and a beautiful tomorrow has become crucial in our fragmented often strained world garc a observed
and her success speaks for itself
the commercial pay off for the magazine exceeded expectations garc a said
we thought this cover would be popular but its reach blew us away especially on social media
her fans showed their support and it was quite amazing
as her profile grows karol is increasingly aware that her ability to attract top tier fashion partners from europe and the us is what helps give her the platform to support designers from latin america and the diaspora
intimate portraits of lgbtq youths living deep in the amazon rainforest
colombia has globally recognized designers and i ve had the chance to see the incredible talent there first hand at colombiamoda karol said of colombia s fashion week
but what might surprise you is that many of the things we wear are from small independent designers that don t have that much recognition says karol
for instance when i m on stage i work with the same people from medell n who make my shoes and it s been lovely to introduce the work of these colombian artisans to stylists like brett alan nelson and to connect them karol said
but i ve been thinking about it lately and i think i can do more to help take their work to the next level
her access to colombia s dynamic textile and garment manufacturing industry leads to another question what about future business opportunities beyond modeling based partnerships does she harbor any ambition to emulate other pop stars turned fashion entrepreneurs by co designing a capsule collection or launching her own brand
i m exploring how to expand my brand now actually
i want to ensure that even if i retire from music someday my name remains relevant and alive in other areas she said
but any brand that s associated with karol g has to be offering something that i can offer to my people that s genuinely good positive and helpful she said
then i d be eager to share it with everyone
