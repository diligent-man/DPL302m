A young elegantly dressed Black woman wears a small but determined smile on her face
Graffiti on the door next to her reads KEEP BRITAIN WHITE The photograph taken by Jamaican-born photographer Neil Kenlock and part of a new exhibition at London’s Somerset House is impossible to look away from
The Missing Thread Untold Stories of Black Fashion is filled with photos like this as the showcase dives deep into the history of Black British culture from the s to the present day — specifically how it has been a forgotten influence on the fashion industry
There’s a resilience that has had to be forged in the community said Andrew Ibi one of the exhibition’s curators of the woman in Kenlock’s photo
In the face of this people would expect her to be wearing riot clothes but she looks immaculate Her hair’s done she has jewelry on… It’s like a uniform of resilience
Harry Styles Bjork and celebrating fashion’s rebels
It took Ibi Jason Jules and Harris Elliot — the designers and academics behind the Black Orientated Legacy Development Agency BOLD — almost three years to make the show
This goes way beyond fashion said Jules in an interview with CNN
While the last decade has seen a rise in the number of Black creatives and designers gaining recognition — from Law Roach receiving the first ever Stylist Award at the CFDA Fashion Awards to Chioma Nnadi becoming the first Black woman to edit British Vogue — Ibi Jules and Elliot felt there were more stories to tell
Ibi remembers the disadvantages he faced even as a student using his loan to buy his mother a gas fire for their freezing house in the winter
There have always been disparities in our journeys he said
My White counterparts were not operating in that way
It came to a point where I thought this can’t all be rotten luck there is something else stacked against us
There are painful recounts of failed fashion careers such as that of s designer Wayne Pinnock
A fashion graduate from London’s prestigious Royal College of Art Pinnock’s early work was spotlighted by legendary style journalist Suzy Menkes in the New York Times and he even spent time working for Moschino in Milan
Despite such promise the exhibition chronicles Pinnock works in a supermarket today — his fashion flowers withheld until now
Others stories featured in the exhibition come from the historically ignored perspective of Black women though Jules admits they were hard to locate
We realized how much Black women were missing from the conversation
It wasn’t enough to have Black women in photographs
We wanted photographers creatives designers he said
Where were they Is it because they don’t exist Were they not good enough It comes down to many of them now having their story told in the first place
It’s a common theme — a missing thread that unites the exhibition together
Voices erased from history now exhibited pride of place
Elliot found his role as co-curator particularly emotional — unearthing researching and frequently revisiting decades-old experiences of racism
Charlie Allen a third generation Black tailor told me that at one point whilst he was working at an establishment on London’s Regent Street in the s that the racism was so bad he had to recite the rd Psalm when he got into the lift every morning because it was the only thing that got him through the day
The show is about connecting the dots — whether that be through a nail bar installation that nods to the influence of nail art prevalent in dancehall fashion and now widely co-opted by White celebrities and popular culture or mapping the influence of trailblazing designers such as Bruce Oldfield one of the royal families favorite couturiers and designer of Queen Camilla’s coronation gown or Ozwald Boateng the first Black man to work in London’s esteemed tailoring institution Savile Row
At the center of the exhibition is the work of Black British designer Joe Casely-Hayford who died in
Casely-Hayford was nominated for Womenswear British Designer of the Year in and also Innovative Designer of the Year in
While his clothes are part of history U singer Bono wore his designs when he became the first man to appear on the cover of US Vogue in his name has long stood adjacent
In Casely-Hayford received a Most Excellent Order of the British Empire OBE for his contributions to the arts and his pieces are now part of permanent collections at the Victoria Abert Museum in London and the FIT Museum in New York City
The Missing Thread is however the first ever major showing from the designer’s archive
What Uganda’s war on second-hand clothes means for fashion
I remember speaking to Charlie Joe Casely-Hayford’s son who had tears in his eyes when he told me that he didn’t think his father’s story was ever going to be told said Harris
How do you turn some of that pain into something yes challenging but also something of beauty While I’d love people to leave with a little more of an understanding of what our experiences as Black designers have been amidst all that I would love people to see and acknowledge the beauty in what we do
