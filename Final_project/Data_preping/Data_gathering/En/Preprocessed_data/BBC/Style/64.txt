Editor’s Note Design for Impact is a series spotlighting architectural solutions for communities displaced by the climate crisis natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies
A double whammy of the human-caused climate crisis and the arrival of El Niño has fueled soaring temperatures that have made this year downright deadly
July has been declared the world’s hottest month on record
In a recent address UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres ominously described this year as the dawning of the era of global boiling
In Europe over people died last year from heat-related illnesses with some countries adopting a naming system for heat waves akin to those used for hurricanes and typhoons
The Italian Meteorological Society for instance named a recent heatwave Cerberus after the three-headed hound guarding the gates of hell in Dante’s Inferno
Problems are especially acute in densely populated cities where the urban heat island effect can result in microclimates about degrees Celsius degrees Fahrenheit hotter than surrounding areas
The phenomenon first documented in the s by an amateur meteorologist in London occurs in areas with high concentrations of heat-absorbing concrete buildings asphalt surfaces and a dearth of green spaces
Despite knowing about the perils of global warming for decades many cities are proving to be woefully unprepared
Now local officials are appointing chief heat officers to expedite heat action plans while start-ups race to invent better air conditioners and personal cooling devices
Many solutions are based on time-tested design principles
Here are five things cities are doing right now to combat rising temperatures
A healthy canopy of trees is among the most effective and egalitarian defenses against the urban heat island effect
Seeking refuge beneath a tree can feel to degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit cooler compared to standing in direct sunlight according to the US Environmental Protection Agency
Apart from the instant relief of shade a process called evapotranspiration where water transfers from plants and soil into the atmosphere also helps cool surrounding areas by up to degrees Celsius degrees Fahrenheit
Barcelona which has become something of a laboratory for progressive urban interventions may soon offer a vital case study on the efficacy of trees
Per its Tree Master Plan the Spanish city aims to blanket of its land with a variety of climate-resilient species by
Today holm oaks Aleppo pines plane trees cypresses and other hardy species already line the city’s streets and new superilla or superblocks which are essentially reclaimed roads that have been turned into tree-lined public plazas
Only a handful of the planned superblocks were completed in time for this grueling Spanish summer though the city plans to finish them all by the end of the decade
In Chinese cities including Wuhan and Chongqing where temperatures exceeded degrees Fahrenheit last year cooling sprays can be found in malls parks and bus stops
The sprays are sometimes complemented by fleets of mist cannons — essentially utility trucks equipped with high-pressure water sprayers pictured above — that have been roving big cities in China since according to the environmental think tank China Dialogue
Although these cannons were initially introduced to tackle air pollution a recent study from Seoul National University suggests that spraying fine water particles can lower ambient temperatures by as much as especially if misters are positioned at optimal angles
Austria’s capital Vienna has meanwhile designated areas as cool straßen cool streets equipped with drinking fountains mist showers and smart sprinkler systems that automatically activate when temperatures rise above degrees Celsius degrees Fahrenheit
An awning is a simple and inexpensive weather shield that’s fallen out of fashion due to contemporary architecture’s penchant for sleek facades
But as cities become desperate for quick answers to unrelenting heat canopies may be coming back in style
The Spanish city of Seville sometimes known as the Iberian oven has recently expanded its network of large canvas awnings to shield more transit stations playgrounds schools and hospitals
In Tel Aviv Israel a series of canopies made with LumiWeave a smart cloth embedded with solar cells has been installed in the city’s business district
Developed by Israeli product designer Anai Green the awnings store solar energy during the daytime that is then used to power LED lights woven into the material
As residents of Greek islands can attest painting rooftops and buildings white is an easy and relatively inexpensive defense against hot summers
Benefiting from something called the albedo effect a structure with a clean white roof reflects around of direct sunlight compared to a dark roof which reflects only about
Now a research team at Indiana’s Purdue University claims to have developed a type of ultra-white paint that can reflect of sunlight and lower a building’s surface temperature compared to its surroundings by nearly degrees Fahrenheit at night or by degrees Fahrenheit during strong sunlight
Covering a roof area of around square feet in this paint would produce the equivalent of kilowatts of cooling power said Xiulin Ruan a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue in a press statement
That’s more powerful than the central air conditioners used by most houses
In Los Angeles the city’s Bureau of Street Services has in recent years been painting roads in a reflective white-gray coating called CoolSeal
In after a - to - degree Fahrenheit cooling effect was recorded in pilot areas LA’s then-mayor Eric Garcetti announced a plan to cover miles of road lanes with cooling material by — an initiative that will cost the city an estimated per mile according to journal published by the Royal Institute of British Architects
But white isn’t the only cooling pigment
A pilot project in LA’s Pacoima neighborhood is testing the efficacy of street coatings that come in a variety of colors
According to the manufacturer StreetBond the acrylic-based colorant is designed to reduce urban heat island effect by at least degrees Fahrenheit
But as cities invest in solar reflective coatings a study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters threw cold water on the strategy by suggesting that while reflective sidewalks do result in cooler surface temperatures humans in these spaces may actually feel warmer because they end up absorbing the heat
Solar reflective coatings are not a policy panacea for urban heat problems the authors wrote adding that municipalities need to consider when and how people use land to decide which heat metric air surface or radiant temperature should be prioritized
A growing cadre of architects and urbanists are eschewing Western architectural traditions by embracing the natural ventilation traditional construction techniques and materials like insulating mud bricks that have been used for millennia by those living in hot climates
Pritzker Prize-winning architect Francis Kr for instance creates a sense of airiness through his inventive use of clay laterite stones eucalyptus branches and dead wood
School buildings Kr designed in his native Burkina Faso show how to build comfortable and convivial spaces in extremely hot weather — without the need for AC
In the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu the Auroville Earth Institute has become a locus of this burgeoning vernacular architecture movement
Over nearly four decades the research center has been collaborating with architects and builders around the world interested learning how to build economical and low-carbon structures from compressed mud and soil
Compared to concrete glass and steel traditional earth bricks absorb more heat and humidity
Would you live in a cave These architects believe we should
Indian architect Anupama Kundoo who has built several structures in Auroville is known for beautiful climate-resilient buildings made with materials sourced on the spot as she has described her work
Speaking at last year’s The World Around Summit in the Netherlands Kundoo made a compelling case for recognizing the unique qualities of a area’s geography — and building with whatever is abundant there
If you look at pre-industrial architecture we built with any material she explained
If there was mud we used mud if there was wood we used wood if it’s a desert and there’s no wood you build domes if there’s ice you use ice
There is a deep deep relationship between what you produce and where you use it she added
