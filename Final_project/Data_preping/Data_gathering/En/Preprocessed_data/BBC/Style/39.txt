At pm on Wednesday evening St Paul s an iconic part of the London skyline for hundreds of years concluded its choral evensong service as usual And just an hour later the nearly year old Church of England cathedral was ready to stage its first techno night
The historic venue has been the backdrop for a number of grand events The Diamond Jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria in the funerals of Admiral Lord Nelson in and Winston Churchill in and marriage of King Charles III and Diana in But this week as part of a collaboration between the City of London Corporation and Fabric nightclub it was home to a performance from Australian techno rock artist Ry Cuming known by their stage name Ry X accompanied by the London Contemporary Orchestra

We wanted to bring people back to the City said Jorge Nieto the creative director at Fabric just hours before the event The area surrounding St Paul s has been somewhat lost to an abundance of office buildings and corporate lunch spots Nieto said It s about reconnecting younger audiences with the city and re conceptualizing spaces
The public s reaction to the event was overwhelming According to Fabric of the church s capacity sold in three hours via a pre sale registration with the rest of the tickets selling out within minutes of general release creating a waiting list of over people
On the night a distinctly youthful crowd sat in secular awe as the sounds of electric guitars drum kick machines and synthesizers filled the th century domes Aside from outdoor security the event was managed by the cathedral s regular ushers who typically oversee services such as Eucharist Mass and Holy Communion dressed in their religious regalia no less Unlike a typical techno gig there was no bar The stage despite being the site of the performance seemed almost inconsequential rather it was the blue red and orange lighting bouncing off the gold leaf frescoes or the intricacy of stained glass windows that held your attention as the music swelled
For Ry X a year old Grammy nominated artist and producer who flew over from California especially for the gig the right venue can make or break a concert And St Paul s he said was a no brainer There s not many things you drop everything for he told CNN in an interview ahead of his performance If you have a space that already has reverence and beauty and majesty to it when people enter it they re already changed Then half the work is done
Staging a techno rock concert inside a protected landmark of course comes with its challenges The cathedral s unique architecture and abundance of negative space proved to be particularly challenging for Ry I don t think a synthesizer has been played in this building before he said So I was thinking How s this going to go Is it going to rattle something He was also reckoning with considerable reverberation every sound producing a chain reaction of echoes that hang in the space for seconds play too fast and you risk an aural pile up I m going to play in a way that I wouldn t anywhere else right for this room he said I m almost making the music fit St Paul s specifically
With the cathedral in active service up until an hour before the performance so Ry and Nieto s teams had just one soundcheck the night before to get it right We just took our best guess said Nieto We were here until am getting the sound down to a T
High notes The world s most beautiful concert halls
Perhaps it was the cathedral s imposing iconography or simply the power of live music but during the performance a certain fervor was in the air When Ry commanded the audience to rise from our seats during his finale we did whooping and hollering much more than the average congregation Guests left their seats to approach the pulpit and some even stood on their chairs Who said you can t play techno in a church Ry shouted out to the crowd amid thunderous applause
