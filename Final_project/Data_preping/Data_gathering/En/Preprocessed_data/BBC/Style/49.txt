just days after milan fashion week donatella versace is making headlines not for her albeit well received spring summer collection but for her stance on the italian government s anti lgbtq policies
in an impassioned speech at an award ceremony in milan on sunday night the designer denounced prime minister giorgia meloni s far right led coalition for ongoing measures to restrict lgbtq rights including a clampdown on same sex parents
versace the creative director of her namesake label received a standing ovation for the comments as she accepted a prize for equity and inclusivity at the cnmi sustainable fashion awards
here in italy it has never been more important for us to champion minority voices
our government is set on taking away the rights of individuals to live as they wish versace said
the freedom to walk down the street with your head held high and without fear whatever your identity
the freedom to start a family and live the way we want
the freedom to love who we want
we all have a duty to fight for our freedom

although italy legalized same sex civil unions in the country does not permit same sex marriage stepchildren adoption or surrogacy stances that rights groups attribute to opposition from the catholic church
a controversial new policy alluded to by versace in her speech has seen the interior ministry demand that in cases where same sex couples had children via surrogacy abroad officials only register one biological parent on their birth certificates and earlier this year in the northern city of padua meloni s brothers of italy party began removing the names of non biological gay mothers from their child s birth certificates
in july meloni s government passed a bill criminalizing overseas surrogacy entirely
at a time when trans people are still victims of terrible violence when children of same sex couples are not considered their children and when minorities are targeted by new legislation we still have much to do versace said
the designer was accompanied at the event by alessandro zan a member of italy s parliament and an outspoken lgbtq activist
in zan proposed a bill to amend italy s penal code to ban discrimination on the grounds of sex sexual orientation gender gender identity or disability that was eventually rejected three years later
in response to a request for comment from cnn the prime minister s office said the prime minister has not commented on donatella versace s remarks
members of italy s lgbtq community have since praised versace for her comments
we thank donatella versace for breaking the asphyxiating silence of convenience that we have long recorded on the unbelievable actions of the meloni government gabriele piazzoni secretary general of arcigay the country s largest lgbtq not for profit organization told cnn via email
versace is right giorgia meloni s government daily and methodically erodes the rights and dignity of many social groups both on a symbolic and very concrete level she added
it happens with lgbtqia people with women with migrant people and that s to name just a few
fabrizio marrazzo spokesperson for italy s gay party a political group formed in to champion anti discrimination measures meanwhile described versace s speech as a positive step for italy s business and fashion world at large
milan fashion week stars and style align at the spring summer shows
she s been one of the very few figures that hasn t been afraid to make her thoughts heard and we can only hope more will follow her example he told cnn in a phone interview we certainly aren t the only ones to believe our government is quashing our rights
it s pure discrimination marrazzo added of the government s stance towards same sex parents
while the new policies have drawn thousands of protestors to the streets of milan italian brands and fashion industry figures have largely remained quiet on the divisive issue
marrazzo attributed this to fear of repercussions
i think a lot of companies believe they might lose a big chunk of their audience and consequently a huge amount of money if they say something he said
but that couldn t be further from the truth
many italians are with us
versace however has long been a vocal advocate for gay rights
in june capri holdings her label s parent company launched the versace foundation to support programs projects and activities designed to generate awareness and support for the lgbtq community
during her speech on sunday the designer recalled her late brother gianni versace coming out to her as gay when she was years old
for me it changed nothing
i loved him and i didn t care who he loved she said
