well i m obviously a great fan of the little black dress quipped tristram hunt director of london s victoria and albert museum when asked about the appeal of gabrielle chanel
fashion manifesto the institution s latest blockbuster exhibition
staged with fashion boutique like gloss the show is a uk first on the famous couturier who built one of the world s most successful fashion brands at the end of chanel employed nearly people worldwide
bringing together pieces from v a s collection the palais galliera fashion museum in paris and the patrimoine de chanel the heritage collections of the fashion house it features some outfits in total
the display starts with a collared blouse dating from
made from fine gauge silk jersey it is one of the earliest surviving chanel garments
it then moves on through s drop waist day dresses to s evening pajamas tailored trouser ensembles in brocade and lam via a two tier room of the brand s emblematic skirt suits before ending with pieces from chanel s final collection of
capturing the ambitious beauty of karl lagerfeld s chanel shows
a lot of the early pieces are over years old and it s amazing to see how relevant they are to today show curator oriole cullen told cnn in an interview
cullen singles out the show opening tunic for its chic wearability
it s the garment that really launched chanel s career in fashion
it s so simple so streamlined and of course made from her famous jersey fabric
chanel s focus on comfort and freedom of movement in fashion was pioneering and instantly popular
in american vogue described her little black crepe de chine day dress as the chanel ford the frock that all the world will wear and it became synonymous with the modern woman in the jazz age with independence strength and resilience said justine picardie author of coco chanel the legend and the life in a phone interview with cnn
an unique aspect of chanel as a designer is that her clothes were so radical in their innovations at the time when she launched them and yet they look so timeless
but the reason that this biopic of a museum show has swiftly sold out although members can still access without booking is because it resonates beyond the world of fashion
for hunt chanel s transformation of the boyish gar onne look and her interplay of gender identities in the early th century seems so modern
she was a remarkable woman and the account of her life is very much part of the story of the exhibition
gabrielle coco chanel was born in in a hospice for the poor in saumur western france
at the age of her mother died and she was placed by her father in a convent orphanage in the village of aubazine she had such a traumatic childhood she never saw her father again after he abandoned her said picardie who stayed at the aubazine convent during the research for her book
but throughout her life she turns her grief into something powerfully creative
thus the influence of the nuns black and white habits can be seen in her many monochrome ensembles
and later the little black dress emerges from a period of bereavement and sorrow after the death of arthur boy capel an english polo player the first great love of her life who dies at the end of said picardie
chanel is one of those designers that can access not only her own emotions but our emotions too her experiences of love and loss of trying to find strength and self expression are universal and i think that is what makes her designs and also her perfumes so resonant so expressive so powerful so potent and so alluring
but before chanel was a couturier she was a milliner and also proved herself a shrewd businesswoman and entrepreneur
she opened her first boutique on the rue cambon in paris in expanding to the well heeled resorts of deauville and biarritz and using the success of these ventures to launch her clothing line
it wasn t long before she expanded again in she launched her first perfume the famous n which went on to be the world s best selling fragrance
in the s when marilyn monroe was asked what do you wear to bed she replied chanel n
remember when marissa cooper wore fake chanel on the o c
one room of the show is dedicated to the invisible accessory revealing the striking modernity of chanel s vision with collections of the instantly recognizable bottles as well as make up and skincare products also launched in the s and examples of her clever advertising campaigns
other spaces display later emblematic launches the still sought after chanel handbag her chic two tone slingback shoes and a range of costume jewelry
a particular joy is the kaleidoscopic room of suits in the s chanel really embraces color and runs with it said cullen of a selection that runs from chic sailor stripes a style worn by actor jeanne moreau to the cannes film festival in to eye popping tweeds
she works with innovative textile designers to create these amazing fabrics in hot pinks and poison greens
throughout details of her personal life are detailed in biographical panels of text as well as photographs chanel with her lovers including hugh grosvenor nd duke of westminster as well as with her friend winston churchill
when the latter was staying with chanel and the duke at sutherland estate in scotland he wrote of chanel she fishes from morning till night and in two months has killed salmon
i think that s really important because chanel s clothing was designed for movement and activity said cullen
before she started her career in fashion and was living with her lover tienne balsan a horse trainer she really embraces horse riding she has little tailored breeches and she s riding astride not side saddle like most women were at that time
then with the duke of westminster she plunges herself into hunting shooting and fishing and the wardrobes that go with them the corduroys tweeds and knitted jerseys
one area of chanel s life that has often been discussed is her wartime relationship with german embassy official hans g nther von dincklage
in july the nazi authorities recorded chanel as a trusted source
but newly discovered documents show that in chanel joined the french resistance as an occasional agent research that is incorporated into both the exhibition and the new edition of picardie s biography
there s so much myth about chanel says picardie whose research into chanel s life spans years
i ve never seen her as a nazi supporter so when this document turned up showing that she was in fact a member of the french resistance it adds for me the final piece in the puzzle
all too often people just look at the surface of fashion but there can be no beautiful surface without understanding the hidden depths concludes picardie and never is that more true than with a designer like chanel where the story of her life emerges through her designs
