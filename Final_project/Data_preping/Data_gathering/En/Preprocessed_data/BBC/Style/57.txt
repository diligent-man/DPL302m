the victoria s secret fashion show is back but the formula you know is long gone
for more than years the annual cultural phenomenon saw a who s who of supermodels don over the top lingerie and angel wings to strut down a runway to performances by the likes of justin timberlake lady gaga jay z and kanye west
that s now been replaced by a feature length documentary called the tour which premiered tuesday on prime video
the documentary comes after a five year hiatus for the fashion show seemingly due to plummeting viewership and myriad controversies from a former executive s comments on trans models to growing critiques of the brand s narrow view of sex appeal to an explosive documentary detailing the company s historic links to disgraced financier jeffrey epstein
new documentary unearths troubling links between victoria s secret and jeffrey epstein
so what can you expect from the tour the comeback film is not a single runway show a l rihanna s savage x fenty but instead spotlights four collections from independent designer artists based in lagos bogot london and tokyo
each presentation takes place in an airy barcelona villa where host gigi hadid guides viewers between segments vs all stars like naomi campbell and adriana lima strut in ensembles alongside a diverse cast of models including adut akech winnie harlow quannah chasinghorse paloma elsesser hailey bieber and lila moss to name a few
preceding the showcases are short films introducing the women creatives including the designers and filmmakers who together make up the vs they include piscis canizales a colombian dancer and activist who went viral for voguing in front of heavily armed police at a protest in and kom i a japanese singer formerly of cult electronic j pop band wednesday campanella
the tour is intended to be the ultimate expression of the victoria s secret brand transformation according to a press statement from the company s head creative director ra l martinez
it offers a more expansive global take on femininity than the lingerie label is known for with one designer lagos based bubu ogisi blending divine inspiration from yoruba and igbo mythologies and another jen fang shueh of tokyo label jenny fax exploring the corporeal realities of reaching middle age
the collections will not be sold by victoria s secret though some products inspired by the tour will be made available online
beyond its new film victoria s secret is touting new funding initiatives for women artists and entrepreneurs
the brand also appears to be responding to longstanding criticism that its fashion show has over the years been culturally insensitive putting karlie kloss in a native american headdresses in for one and has reinforced impossible body ideals
one designer michaela stark accentuates the curves of bellies and love handles in her lingerie ensembles rather than concealing them
stark says in the tour that she agreed to contribute to the film in order to tackle the body dysmorphia she felt from watching past victoria s secret shows
in high school it was a big thing
but it was also that culture around it of not wanting to eat after you saw it she said in the documentary just before putting plus size models in archival victoria s secret runway looks
but through no fault of the talented artists victoria s secret assembled the tour feels disjointed
rather than an event with a capital e like the original fashion show its short films only offer quick moments subdued runways and storytelling that doesn t stay on any topic long enough to penetrate its surface
the production certainly doesn t lack for star power with interludes by doja cat and afro colombian singer goyo interspersed with miscellaneous vignettes interview snippets music videos footage of dance activism behind the scenes of art making and design poetic audio from writers and offbeat performance art
victoria s secret is overhauling its image
is it enough to regain relevance
the film does not clearly articulate why this particular group of artists was brought together as the vs beyond the tour serving as platform for unique women s stories as a spokesperson told cnn nor is it clear what they have to do with the bedazzled corsets and leather two piece ensembles from the victoria s secret collection that are confusingly modeled as an intermission between the other presentations
the tour is clearly meant to remake and reestablish vs s identity but what is that exactly as the company retired its angels rolled out its new vs collective ambassadors including priyanka chopra jonas and megan rapinoe and reunited famous faces like campbell and lima for splashy campaigns the direction of its lingerie has arguably been an unmemorable afterthought
the new vs may be exploring healthier more inclusive ideas around femininity and sexiness but whether the label has truly found itself though soul searching ventures like the tour remains to be seen
