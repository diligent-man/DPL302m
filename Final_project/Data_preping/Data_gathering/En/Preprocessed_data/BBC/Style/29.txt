western australia may soon be home to the world s tallest wooden building after authorities in perth green lit plans for a meter tall foot hybrid tower constructed using mass timber
on thursday perth s metro inner south joint development assessment panel jdap approved grange development s proposal for the skyscraper currently dubbed the c building which would stand nearly twice as high as the current record holder
the developers say of the proposed tower will be constructed from timber with the columns and core made of reinforced concrete
if completed the high rise will surpass the world s tallest timber concrete hybrid building the ascent tower in milwaukee wisconsin which stands at stories or meters feet according to the council on tall buildings and urban habitat
the proposed structure located on charles street in south perth will also be taller than the forthcoming hybrid timber atlassian headquarters in sydney which is poised to claim the record from ascent but is yet to be completed
like atlassian the proposed c tower will combine laminated timber beams with a steel exoskeleton to support the the structure
according to grange development the story tower will contain more than apartments and will be western australia s first carbon negative residential building
the intent of c has always been at its core a straightforward proposition grange development s director james dibble said in a press release
our aspiration with c is to shift the focus towards a more climate conscious approach
world s tallest timber residential tower to be built
the tower will use cubic meters over cubic feet of timber harvested from trees according to grange
we can t grow concrete dibble said in a proposal submitted to perth authorities calling the plan a new open sourced blueprint that utilizes hybrid construction methodology to offset the carbon within our built environment which is the single biggest contributor to climate change
this is our opportunity to state that we genuinely care about both the housing crisis before us and the climate crisis we are doing very little about as an industry he added
beyond using timber grange s plan also includes green features such as a rooftop garden an urban farm and resident access to new fully electric tesla model s
philip oldfield an associate architecture professor and head of the university of new south wales school of built environment told cnn he thinks environmentally the project has strong credentials
typically we build tall buildings out of steel and concrete
cement is responsible for of all co emissions
so by replacing concrete and steel with a bio material such as timber it is going to reduce the environmental impact of the building quite significantly oldfield said over the phone
the buildings set to shape the world in
however he expressed skepticism about some of the developer s other claims
i m a little more cynical about the idea that it s carbon negative oldfield said
the only way it would be carbon negative is if the building stored more carbon in the timber than was released by the other materials
that may be possible but that s always going to be temporary
nevertheless oldfield is optimistic about the growing use of timber in construction
overall i think it s a great move forward he said
we do need to be building far more of our buildings out of timber
