once if you were talking about going to the salon for a trim a restyle color or shape you d have been talking about the hair on your scalp

brows help break up the planes of the face and create many different illusions similar to those created through contouring

eyebrows are fairly easy and painless to change said beauty historian jill burke
they grow back and so offer an opportunity for experimentation so if it seems that we re cycling through brow trends more quickly than ever before it s because we most likely are
in the last few years alone we ve had kim kardashian s heavy geometric block brows cara delevigne s feathered brows and lizzo s bleached out brows among others
