editor s note in snap we look at the power of a single photograph chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made
a young man stands grinning in beijing s forbidden city
it s the dead of winter and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill
the other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass coca cola bottle
today coke is the world s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere
but back in when the image was shot by pulitzer prize winning photographer liu heung shing it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary chinese people
liu who was in his late s when he began working for time magazine in beijing felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of mao zedong in
the changes at first were subtle and unless you lived there you wouldn t have noticed he recalled during an interview at his home in hong kong
the blue marble one of earth s most iconic images years on
he had earlier photographed people grieving for mao along the banks of the pearl river in guangzhou
it was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late s china where he grew up during the disastrous great leap forward campaign a series of failed industrialization policies before moving back to hong kong as a child
under mao the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty and the tumultuous years of the cultural revolution
but in the aftermath of the chinese leader s death liu said suddenly people s steps looked a little bit lighter they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed
it would prove to be a relatively liberal period in chinese history politically economically and in terms of everyday life which liu captured in candid shots
one photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure
another depicted people gathering at a democracy wall in beijing where they wrote now unthinkable criticisms of the government
one of liu s most iconic images was captured on his way into the time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was missing he turned his car around and sure enough a large portrait of mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down
he quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late chairman with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame
this was china moving out of the shadow of mao he said
in december coca cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland chinese market since the communist revolution
that same month beijing and washington announced the normalization of sino american relations and deng xiaoping kick started china s transformative economic reforms with his open door policy
coca cola was first introduced to china in the s but had been forced to leave in along with other foreign companies by a government that regarded it as bourgeois
liu had photographed the opening of a joint venture bottling plant in beijing capturing coke chairman roberto goizueta and chinese trade officials drinking coca cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of ganbei cheers
he then thought to himself now where do i find a regular chinese person enjoying this drink
he headed to the forbidden city with its heavy flow of tourists and soon found a man named zhang wei purchasing a coke from a small stand
i remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy coke it tastes so so said liu who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace s picturesque pavilions in the background
forbidden city at how china s imperial palace survived against the odds
the response to coke itself may have been underwhelming but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many chinese people felt at the time
as a photographer i of course realized the significance
that this man dressed in a ubiquitous pla people s liberation army coat was one of the very first people to taste it he said adding but i didn t realize it would become part of the chinese collective memory
the image would be widely published and displayed in the following years and he later became friends with zhang
in it appeared in liu s photography book china after mao a collection of images taken between and
more recently he included it in his book liu heung shing a life in a sea of red
striking photos document the collapse and evolution of th century communism
the photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country s modern history including the tiananmen square crackdown
and just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy liu s coca cola photograph feels part of another era altogether
with its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign ideas encapsulated in that most american of drinks the image stands in stark contrast to today s china where relations with the us are at an all time low
xi jinping s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the west
i realized that the story i did in the last quarter of the th century would continue to carry relevance into the st century liu said
especially with the story of china i never doubt that these photographs are in the chinese people s collective memory
even though this memory keeps being re edited the good thing about a photograph is you cannot re edit it
it becomes an image seared in people s minds
