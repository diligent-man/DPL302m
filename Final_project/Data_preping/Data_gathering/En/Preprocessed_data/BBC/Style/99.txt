there are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city s image than marina bay sands
just as the eiffel tower and burj khalifa define the skylines of paris and dubai the soaring three tower resort joined across the top by a horizontal skypark and the world s most famous infinity pool is an icon both in and of singapore
in fact the hotel casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn t even stay there
it s too noisy said israeli canadian architect moshe safdie
i m a swimmer and i can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures
now resuming his once frequent trips to singapore amid easing travel restrictions safdie prefers the nearby ritz carlton where we meet for afternoon tea
i had a british mother he explained so i m a sucker for scones and tea at a top floor table overlooking his best known creation he reflected on the sometimes fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks
it wasn t on my mind as much as it was on their minds he clarified recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city state s government in the mid s
they didn t quite say the building should become the icon of singapore but they talked about it being iconic
when we made the submission i said some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place and i mentioned sydney opera house as the classic contemporary example
but i said it s a mystery what makes that happen
the trick it transpired was designing something striking yet simple
constructing a mile long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but at its most abstract marina bay sands can be sketched in four basic strokes
in singapore sign language the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top
visible for miles around it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops
the structure also stars in the official singapore lego set which the architect proudly displays at his office back in somerville massachusetts
that kind of stuff you can t quite plan for or design it just happens he said of the building s success
but i m very happy about it
it changed our lives in terms of the work we get
safdie s eponymous firm is in high demand
in the years since marina bay sands opened in he has realized almost major projects
among them are the serene crystal bridges museum of american art in arkansas and a dual tower residential complex in colombo sri lanka that sees one high rise lean dramatically against the other
the architect also bequeathed singapore with another landmark in jewel a nature themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of instagrammers to changi airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall
safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect s greatest pleasures
he makes a point of visiting jewel whenever he s in singapore
i was concerned about how the plants were doing he said
but i was relieved to see they re thriving
the architect is not in singapore to indulge in past glories however
in the days after our interview he will inspect two new developments a gardenesque office complex in the island s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket orchard road
the latter features multiple skybridges a recurring theme in safdie s work that was recently taken to new extremes in chongqing china where he lay a gargantuan horizontal skyscraper containing an infinity pool restaurants and an indoor garden atop four foot tall towers
then there is the small matter of marina bay sands second phase
the expansion plans feature among other things a fourth tower though safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top
in any case singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn t in his words screw around with an icon
instead the new tower will stand apart from the other three forming sort of an exclamation mark he explained motioning punctuative strokes boooom boom
at safdie shows little sign of slowing down
other recent trips have taken him to sao paolo brazil where his glass roofed albert einstein education and research center recently opened its doors and to the ecuadorian capital quito where his tree covered qorner tower will do so later this year
covid eased the architect s unrelenting travel schedule but he used the downtime to pen a memoir if walls could speak my life in architecture he said he felt it was time to document things
published this week if walls could speak serves as a reminder that much of safdie s six decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits museums memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities
before marina bay sands his best known project was his very first habitat a radical s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along montreal s saint lawrence river
safdie s dream that it would spark a wave of large scale habitats around the world proved overly optimistic
his attempts to repeat the feat in other cities including new york toronto and iran s capital tehran have often been thwarted
projects of such size require land funding and political will and safdie s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking
but the principles underpinning the experiment that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors defined his work thereafter
born in in haifa then part of british controlled palestine safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood
as a boy he always lived in apartment buildings first in a bauhaus style block on haifa s mount carmel and then at his family s new home further up the hill
at the latter he would enter via a bridge while the famous baha i gardens almost functioned as my backyard he writes in if walls could speak one need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre
safdie moved to canada with his parents aged
in a neat turn of events he departed israel via lod airport since renamed ben gurion airport where decades later he would design a terminal building it was in montreal that safdie decided to pursue architecture and where he first grew his signature mustache
he attended the city s mcgill university and wrote a college thesis a case for city living outlining his vision for a flexible housing system that could be adapted to different contexts and climates
it s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it
but that s been true of my career
moshe safdie
those early ideas have long shaped safdie s outlook
they would shape his fortunes too
after showing his college drawings to the influential modernist louis kahn he secured an apprenticeship at the architect s philadelphia office
soon after he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates
montreal was due to host the world fair or expo
despite having never completed a building the then year old safdie was asked by the event s mastermind and his thesis adviser architect sandy van ginkel to develop a master plan for the site
he was also tasked with building on his ideas eventually proposing a village sized development of some prefabricated dwellings stacked to stories high
his meticulous placement of each factory built module was calculated to maximize garden space allow in sunlight and improve residents views
interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground
political and financial realities scaled back his design the final habitat comprised just apartments made from modules and stacked stories high across three clusters it was nonetheless a major statement
in a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations safdie s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing
three of the th century s most important architects i m
pei paul rudolph and philip johnson toured the project together prior to its opening
only when johnson told safdie that he had outdone the classical italian architect giovanni battista piranesi did he realize the project was a game changer he recounted
habitat was not universally adored
a new yorker cartoon which safdie also displays at his boston office poked gentle fun at the project by depicting a spade wielding child stacking sand into similar formations
various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms
it s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it safdie mused
but that s been true of my career
to define safdie s career by either his breakout success or the megascale projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between
in the early s he opened an office in jerusalem a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed
as well as designing major institutions like the hebrew union college and the yad vashem holocaust history museum he oversaw a full scale rebuild of the destroyed jewish quarter and planned an entirely new city modi in maccabim re ut about miles to its northwest
at one point he even considered running for mayor of jerusalem
he has also built widely in north america where his output spans from the meditative a nondenominational chapel at the harvard business school to the mammoth terminal of toronto s pearson airport
a citizen of israel the us and canada safdie may be best known in the latter for the national gallery in ottawa a grand glass palace housing some of the country s most treasured art
despite earlier setbacks safdie has more recently found fertile ground for his habitats in asia
in he completed the first phase of the sprawling habitat qinhuangdao in the titular city about miles from beijing a series of story mini blocks connected by garden bridges
back in singapore safdie s pixelated sky habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot
there s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then in the renderings everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees
when you look closer you see there s no preparation for the earth there s no depth it s a fantasy
moshe safdie
in both cases and throughout safdie s career ideals articulated in the s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients
yet the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains fundamentally the same
the belief in apartments being rethought as houses in having gardens for every apartment in quality of life in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs he said
and they haven t changed
if anything they have reinforced themselves as years go by
i think without bragging there s been consistency he added
in fact you could say i ve not been dynamic enough but i ve been pretty consistent
there were other high profile proposals that never came to fruition
among the most divisive was the columbus center a pair of heavy set towers once set to loom over manhattan s central park at columbus circle before plans were scrapped following s wall street crash and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of henry kissinger and jacqueline onassis
but safdie s legacy will not be measured only by what was or wasn t built
many of the once radical ideas he championed are now mainstream something he can take an amount of credit for
for one his fixation on plant life a principle he dubbed for everyone a garden in a book of the same name is now widely shared by younger architects
urban gardens and living walls are now almost de rigueur for new large scale developments
plants do not always thrive though
in his memoir safdie distinguishes between significant plant life and sorry shrubs so called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations
as such safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures
the idea of green buildings is a battle cry everyone is for it he said
making them work however is another matter altogether
there s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then in the renderings everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees
when you look closer you see there s no preparation for the earth there s no depth it s a fantasy
prefabrication championed by the architect since his college thesis is also enjoying a renaissance
just two miles away from marina bay sands for instance a singaporean design firm is overseeing two foot tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in malaysia
my daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as i was
i disagree with her
moshe safdie
for a long time people totally gave up on prefabrication safdie said
but now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor not in china because they ve got an extraordinary workforce and not in india but everywhere else in southeast asia in singapore in the west
so anything that is labor saving is now up for grabs
much else has changed since safdie formed his architectural ideals
for one he never would have imagined how densely populated cities would become in the past years
programs change lifestyles change priorities change and technologies change the architect added
but what about him has his outlook changed too my daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as i was the architect said
i disagree with her
safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for
being an architect sometimes means serving regimes you re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours he noted
take the dilemma i had with marina bay sands he said motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the ritz carlton s lounge
on the one hand the idea of doing a building that could promote gaming that s a nice word for it but gambling is the reality is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money
but to me that was or of the area of a project that could show what the public realm could be in a city
and that took over from the issue that nagged me
that s compromise he concluded
but the basic value the idealism of the end product has not diminished
without it i don t know how you can be an architect
if walls could speak my life in architecture published by grove atlantic is available now
