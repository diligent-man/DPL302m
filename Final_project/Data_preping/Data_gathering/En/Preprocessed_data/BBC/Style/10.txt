los angeles is everything a great american city should be rich hilarious of questionable taste and throbbing with fake glamour john waters once wrote chronicling a six hour tour of the city in his book of musings crackpot
the filmmaker and author has over the years spent a lot of time in the tourist mecca that is hollywood boulevard
now he s a bonafide tourist attraction of his own year old waters was recently bestowed with a star on the hollywood walk of fame an honor which coincided with the opening of the academy museum of motion pictures exhibition john waters pope of trash a first of its kind tribute and the biggest retrospective of waters work to date
running until august it features over artifacts related to a sixty year career spanning film television literature and art
a storyteller and entertainer since his childhood in lutherville maryland orchestrating violent puppet shows for birthday parties and horror houses for neighborhood kids in his parents garage waters foray into filmmaking began when his grandmother gifted him an mm movie camera for his th birthday
after briefly attending nyu and getting kicked out for smoking pot he returned to baltimore where he still resides and assembled a ragtag crew of misfit pals and celluloid co conspirators including glenn milstead who would later be known as the drag queen divine as well as mink stole edith massey cookie mueller mary vivian pearce among others
in the s waters wrote produced and directed female trouble desperate living and pink flamingos a cinematic trash trilogy that helped catapulted waters to his near mythical status
the honorifics speak for themselves the filth elder the prince of puke the sultan of sleaze and of course the pope of trash the nickname given to him by william s
burroughs
speaking with cnn after returning home from his trip to la and still overwhelmed with gratitude waters compared the academy museum exhibition to a scene from this is your life the long running tv series that took celebrities through a retrospective of their lives
everybody that s been in my personal and professional life for the last years i think was there he said it was an amazing whirlwind
my head s still spinning
how this dream like photo challenges notions of the male gaze
at the exhibition production notes and audition fliers are displayed alongside props like the lethal leg of lamb from s serial mom which starred kathleen turner as a murderous matriarch and relics like the scratch n sniff odorama cards that were given out at screenings for waters suburban satire polyester
co curators jenny he and dara jaffe began working on the exhibition four years ago sourcing many of the items from wesleyan university in middletown connecticut where waters has been storing his movie memorabilia since the mid s the process of whittling down the original wishlist of waters paraphernalia from over to about was a challenge
we had to kill some darlings we did some hug and release jaffe said at a press preview
at the exhibition s entrance stands a small theater resembling a church complete with stained glass windows of divine and waters other stars
it s a sweet and clever homage to how he held his early film premieres in churches the venues proved to be more financially lucrative than traditional movie theaters
i could keep all the money waters once told culture website flavorwire of the screenings
the son of a devout catholic mother waters isn t religious himself
i don t know i m open
i m just saying what people have told me so far i don t believe in god but who knows nor does he believe in astrology my sign is feces or karma
divine would be alive and marjorie taylor greene would get a flat tire every day he deadpanned
i remember a time when mink stole used to go to thrift shops after halloween when all the costumes were like cents and wear them all year
that s still a good idea wear halloween costumes every day just be a fairy princess or elf
john waters
nonetheless he s had some transcendental moments
every time i go swimming in the ocean on cape cod that is a certain spiritual thing to me i believe the ocean is good for you he said when asked about spiritual experiences
if not superstitions waters does have his rituals
he wakes up every day at a m waters previously told the new york times checks his emails and reads six or seven newspapers before beginning his writing at a m
on the dot
he also jots down his daily schedule on a file card crosses off each of his tasks when completed and then stores the card away
he calls himself overly organized an admirable trait for someone who is both a collector and a maximalist
fake food books pulp novels contemporary art waters home is normally filled with these personal artifacts alongside cinematic mementos like the electric chair from female trouble divine s character in the movie is in its final scene sentenced to death though for the moment this piece can also be seen in the exhibition
during a press preview for the exhibition waters revealed that one item he wished they had procured was divine s cheater drag terminology for a prosthetic vulva with fake pubic hair
divine used to put the piece on top of his suitcase whenever he traveled to prank airport security over the years it ended up with someone who has thusfar unsuccessfully tried getting waters to pay a ludicrous amount of money for it
surreal portraits show drag queens posing with themselves
another iconic piece he told cnn is the iconic red fishtail gown that divine wore in pink flamingos a movie deemed so offensive it was banned in several countries after its release
it was just that one so it was probably fairly grody by the time that we were finished making the movie he said
i don t even know if divine still had it at the end
as the walk of fame ceremony commenced on september a car had caught fire just down the street sending billowing black smoke into the air
it felt like a fitting for an event honoring an auteur known for blowing up hollywood norms
old friends were in attendance mink stole photographer greg gorman and ricki lake whose breakout role came as plus size teen turned dance sensation traci turnblad in waters film hairspray
lake wore black opera gloves embellished with bejeweled cockroaches an homage to a scene in which her character wears a pink cockroach dress as a cheeky response to her archrival amber von tussle s claim she had roaches in her hair the dress created by costume designer van smith is also featured in the exhibition
asked about the influence his movies have had on fashion both on the industry and fans personal style waters pointed to an apparent tribute to the pink flamingos gown appearing in adverts for balenciaga s spring summer collection the gown was later worn by isabelle huppert waters favorite actor to the met gala
something of a style icon himself waters is known to wear comme des gar ons and still sports his signature skinny moustache which he has always drawn on with maybelline velvet black pencil
when it comes to his beauty maintenance he s been a la mer devotee for years even though he complains about the brand s prices
but even the luxury skincare brand gets the john waters treatment after finishing a ounce tub of cr me de la mer one summer he stored bacon grease in it then gifted it to a friend as an art project
whether it s subverting a four figure tub of moisturizer or hollywood waters has always been true to himself
even though he said his goal was to only ever make successful movies he s never wavered in order to fit the status quo
and it s clearly paid off
i haven t changed really everybody just kind of seems to be more ready to laugh at themselves which is what i did in the very beginning he explained
i ve always made fun of the rules of the world that i live in
that s how you can have fun by breaking some of them
slim aarons the photographer who captured high society at play
one rule waters isn t breaking however is his daily writing schedule
after getting in from la he was already back at his desk at a m
the next morning working on his annual christmas show a date run starting in seattle this november
there s also the forthcoming movie adaptation of liarmouth his debut fiction novel which was optioned last year and will mark waters first film since s a dirty shame a movie about a cult of sex addicts with unusual fetishes
he also wants to write another novel
it s tempting to rest on your laurels this week he laughed
but that makes me even more nervous i said this when i was out in la i ain t done
