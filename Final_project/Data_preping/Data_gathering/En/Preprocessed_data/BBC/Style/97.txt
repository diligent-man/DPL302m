a vast collection of art furniture silver ceramics and jewelry long held in the private collection of the rothschild banking dynasty is expected to sell for as much as million over several auctions this fall at christie s new york
the sales will mark the first dedicated auction in north america of works from the french branch of the long time banking family
most of the lots were acquired in the th century by baron james mayer de rothschild his wife betty and their son alphonse and have remained in their descendants collection since
the collection includes art acquired by the family particularly work by old masters led by gerrit dou s painting a young woman holding a hare with a boy at a window which dates back to the th century and is estimated to sell for between million and million
among the oldest items in the sale is a first century ad roman sardonyx cameo portrait of the roman emperor claudius which has a to estimate
coincidentally the cameo last came to auction at christie s in when it sold for about or in today s money shortly before it is believed to have entered the rothschild collection
history s riches inside the private collection of a rothschild heir
these are things that have been kept away since the end of the th century
and unless you knew this particular branch of the family you wouldn t have seen them said jonathan rendell deputy chairman of christie s americas in a phone interview
it s not the type of thing that in new york we normally get to play with
you re more likely to see a sale like this in europe
the consignors members of the french branch of the rothschild family who descended from james mayer de rothschild specifically wanted to hold the sale in new york according to christie s
this particular branch of the family lived in the us during world war ii rendell said while adding that he expects the collection would do incredibly well anywhere
the sale also includes furniture ceramics like important italian renaissance maiolica silver tapestries and jewelry that illustrate the rothschilds distinct taste which rendell described as an extraordinary combination of sumptuousness and domesticity
this is the sort of thing that years ago years ago the market would have gone crazy for
we don t get a bulk of this type of material coming up for sale anymore rendell said

auctions will take place over several days starting with an evening sale on october followed by two day sales and a concurrent live auction in which some lots will start at prices as low as according to christie s
as for why the family is selling the collection now rendell believes it may be a rationalization and a generational shift in attitude
not everybody lives like a th century rothschild even the rothschilds he says
