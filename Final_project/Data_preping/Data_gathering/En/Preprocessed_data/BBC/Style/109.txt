the first time reuben wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast open skies of the american west he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus
the british visual artist now based in chicago has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting enhancing craggy peaks with halos or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity
but for a long time art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth pop band ladytron
photography started as an all consuming hobby he explained in a phone interview
but when ladytron took a break in after five studio albums they released a self titled sixth album in and the seventh time s arrow this month he began a new career from scratch
while the others did their own solo projects making their own music and releasing their own albums this was my solo project
wu s imagery takes a classic photographer s combination light and landscape and marries the two in transformative ways
he often begins with dusky evening light or the ink black shadows of night then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom built consumer drones
in one image a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the peruvian andes revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky
in a different motion piece wu simulated an electrical storm in goblin valley utah but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning
the artist s photo book lux noctis is in the collections of the guggenheim and museum of modern art in new york and he has shot commercial work for apple audi and google as well as the dj and music producer zedd
last summer wu revealed a colossal project for national geographic a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about stonehenge which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones
in november one of his nfts a k video loop titled an irresistible force outperformed its high estimate by over during an auction at sotheby s hong kong selling at hkd about
i couldn t have dreamed of where i am now wu said
i just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography
wu has always been drawn to wild remote places where he could find solitude
his parents immigrated from hong kong to the uk before he was born and he grew up an introverted child in liverpool he said who didn t quite click with school
he was fascinated with science fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday such as steven spielberg s close encounters of the third kind which featured wyoming s devils tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact
unfamiliar with american topography he initially thought the butte a national monument was a fictional geological entity he explained with a laugh
the film s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work
it s cemented into my brain the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky kind of like search lights on very ordinary american landscapes he said
he embarked on his first cross country photography trip across the us in around a decade after getting a taste on the road with ladytron
the resulting series featured vivid depictions of the grand canyon and south dakota badlands as well as a time lapse image of devils tower at night among star trails
two years later wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot
i flew the drone up above some cliffs and i was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape he explained
it made the cliffs glow reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially
wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project
the first iteration he said which he used when the technology was still nascent was a massive eight rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time
the next used a d printed bracket with an led hot light but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air
the tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room with a half hour to fly out capture images and return to him but he s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set up
i m a lot less anxious now because i ve crashed a number of drones he said
and in the end they re just tools
after developing series of still images such as lux noctis and aeroglyphs which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music
he began creating second video loops from his images showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced
these works were very much experimental and had no end goal they were just things that i did for love out of love he said
i couldn t license them i couldn t print them and so they were just there stacking likes on my instagram
but in january wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to nft art
he minted his first non fungible token on the marketplace foundation two months later an aeroglyph of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff
it sold for eth a portion of which he donated to the national parks conservation association and the aapi community fund
later that year the web arts organization obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled aeroglyph variations which took him into the new mexico badlands for a hour shoot that resulted in images of the same setting each with different lighting conditions and patterns
wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways from animations to ar experiences to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints
it s very much a hybrid medium and so i d like to expand that horizon even more and think about the end goal for my work he said
am i creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate or am i creating an experience for people to share
wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes but no matter the medium his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent
a lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work he said
but i m not trying to create an alien looking image i m trying to show that this is our planet
and there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective
