Almost books are being used to train artificial intelligence systems by some of the biggest companies in technology The problem No one told the authors
The system is called Books and according to an investigation by The Atlantic the data set is based on a collection of pirated e books spanning all genres from erotic fiction to prose poetry Books help generative AI systems with learning how to communicate information
Some AI training text can be pulled from articles that are posted on the internet but high quality AI requires high quality text to absorb language from according to the Atlantic which is where books come in Books is already the subject of multiple lawsuits against Meta and other companies using the system to train AI
Now thanks to a database published by The Atlantic last week pulling from Books authors can see whether their books specifically are being used to train these AI systems And many are not happy
I’m completely gutted and whipsawed I am outraged and at the same time feel utterly helpless wrote Mary H K Choi on social media upon discovering her work was being used I’m furious and want to fight but I’m also so tired
Choi whose debut novel Emergency Contact appeared in the database further explained her feelings in an email The book which centers on a young Korean American woman navigating a new relationship was deeply personal and Choi was initially told her story was too quiet and niche The book later went on to become a New York Times bestseller and found audiences around the world
A book encapsulates infinite choices boundless permutations and even shortcomings of the author at the time To think that all this life can be chucked into a vast churning pool to be extruded into a giant algorithmic generative sausage machine reduces so much so swiftly she said Not just financially for the authors but it beggars booksellers librarians and readers from so many intimacies
Min Jin Lee author of novels Pachinko and Free Food for Millionaires expressed similar thoughts on social media bluntly calling the use of her books a theft
I spent three decades of my life to write my books she said The Al large language models did not ‘ingest’ or ‘scrape’ ‘data’ Al companies stole my work time and creativity They stole my stories They stole a part of me
Nora Roberts the prolific romance novelist has books used in the Books database according to The Atlantic That number is the highest by any living author and second only to William Shakespeare She called the database and its use by tech companies all kinds of wrong
We are human beings we are writers and we’re being exploited by people who want to use our work again without permission or compensation to `write’ books scripts essays because it’s cheap and easy Roberts said in a statement to CNN
That exploitation of writers didn’t shock author Nik Sharma whose cookbook Season was found in the database
I’m horrified but not surprised that I’d be taken advantage of he said in a social media post Obviously I wasn’t even asked for permission or received any compensation for the use of my work to train AI
AI is inevitable Sharma said later in an email — hence his lack of surprise What was most aggravating he said is that no one was contacted about usage or payment After all education isn’t free in the US he said teachers are paid and textbooks are bought
It’s the Wild West right now with AI and governmental policy on this is in its infancy Sharma said And consequently tech companies are taking full advantage while they can I’m glad it was just one cookbook and not my others
Meta which has used the Books database according to The Atlantic did not respond to a request for comment
A spokesperson for Bloomberg noted in a statement that the company had used a number of different data sources including Books to train its initial BloombergGPT model an AI model for the financial industry But according to the spokesperson Bloomberg will not include the Books dataset among the data sources used to train future commercial versions of BloombergGPT
Not every author is upset about their work being used by AI James Chappel whose academic book on the modern Catholic church was used in the database said on social media that he doesn’t care at all
I want my book to be read he wrote I want it to educate
Chappel did not respond to requests for further comment
AI in the hands of large corporations has morphed into a significant concern for many writers The Writers Guild of America went on strike this summer in part to demand limits on using AI in writing films and television shows ChatGPT in particular has been used for everything from writing assignments to legal briefs
Writers aren’t alone in their concerns With the popularity of text to image AI systems visual artists were in same situation last year discovering their work was being used to train AI without permission Together both instances highlight concerns around AI’s increasing reach into all forms of art where work can sometimes be intensely personal or intimate
The conversation raised by Books comes just as US President Joe Biden announced plans to introduce an executive order on AI this fall saying that the country will lead the way toward responsible AI innovation
For writers though the constant battles surrounding AI and their work can be deflating For Choi discovering her book had been used in the midst of the WGA strike in which AI was a hotly debated subject was surreal
I was gutted she said over email It truly felt as though any gains or traction there was to be made in one arena could be so handily wiped out in another
And still Choi said she knows her book in the midst of thousands of others is insultingly inconsequential despite its importance to her
I think the part that sucks most profoundly about all of it is that in my more hopeless moments it all feels absolutely inevitable she said
Choi isn’t alone in that feeling of inevitability Roberts called for unity among writers and audiences alike to combat these issues
We who create stories need to unite to fight this abuse of our talent and hard work she said We need to stand for our work and each other’s work I hope readers and viewers stand with us on this vital issue
