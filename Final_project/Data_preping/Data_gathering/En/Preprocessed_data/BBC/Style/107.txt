editor s note in snap we look at the power of a single photograph chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made
to passersby the sight of two men embracing besides new delhi s india gate in might have seemed unremarkable
in a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace it was photographer sunil gupta who attracted more attention at the time
men holding hands or lying in each other s laps is not an issue it looks very romantic from the outside but they re usually just hanging out he said in a video interview from the uk before recalling i was creating more interest than them because i was standing there with a tripod and a camera so everybody was focused on me
onlookers may not have realized but gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the repressive atmosphere of s india
at a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an unnatural offense the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting delhi s gay scene
the pair in question had chosen the war monument s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot
photo of a man posing with a coca cola bottle in symbolized a cultural shift in china
having lived in new delhi until his mid teens london based gupta knew this from personal experience
i passed that place on my way to school every day for years he said
you just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home
it was very easy
the image forms part of the photographer s series exiles which was first exhibited in the uk in but is this week showing at the india art fair in new delhi
primarily shot outdoors around india s capital it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera
concerned about outing his subjects gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a constructed documentary approach
after shooting his images and developing the film in london he returned to delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show
there was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures he said of the india gate shoot
and there were other photos that were more suggestive so i picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series
the other ethical challenge he recalled was communicating to the duo how the images would be used and the art of photography itself
it wasn t for publication and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine so it took some explaining he said adding then i tried to explain the process
photography for many at the time gupta observed was still a very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom

now among india s most celebrated photographic artists gupta often addressed lgbtq experiences in his explorations of race immigration and identity
while studying in the us in the mid s he produced a now celebrated series of photos from new york s christopher street that captured the city s gay scene in the years between the stonewall riots and onset of the aids epidemic
although exiles presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the west gupta s intended audience was always back in london
homophobia was rife in s britain and the photographer said he faced a lot of hostility at art school for making work relating to his sexuality
i couldn t make gay work and i couldn t make gay work about india especially he said
there was none in the library for reference
so i thought i m making it my mission to make some
not for india but for this canon we need to have gay indian guys in our library in our art schools over here
new york s museum of modern art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection signifying the series place in contemporary photography
but it was not an instant success
it didn t have any impact when it was first shown gupta said of its debut
i think it was too early
by the s however interest in gupta s work was growing as art made by and about gay people of color became increasingly visible in the west
the fact that exiles is now showing in india where he said it is positively received is testament to changes on the subcontinent too
although the country s lgbtq communities still face significant social stigma gay sex was decriminalized in and the arrival of apps like grindr have been transformative gupta said
those sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening or maybe happening less he added
this modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light
open source encyclopedia puts years of indian art history in one place
i think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before grindr and the internet gupta said
people think it was all doom and gloom and people jumping off buildings
they don t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then
this is a message reflected in the photographer s carefree india gate shoot which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight
it just seemed very pleasurable
it was a nice day out and i got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh
exiles is showing via vadehra art gallery at india art fair which runs february in new delhi india
a book of outtakes from the series published by aperture is available now
