Following the success of Squid Game on Netflix and Pachinko on Apple TV+ Moving has landed Disney+ its first Korean hit
The star-studded Disney+ Original has become its most successful K-drama globally and the most popular on Hulu in the US beating out the likes of Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe to become Disney’s most watched series across the Asia Pacific region
Moving is a thriller following the fates of low-profile Korean superheroes and their families
The final episode of season one debuted on September
The series has received six Asia Content Awards nominations at Busan International Film Festival an annual celebration of homegrown and international cinema in South Korea’s second largest city including best writer for Kang Full and best actor for Ryu Seungryong Ahead of the awards on October CNN caught up with Ryu to discuss his character why he thinks the show has resonated with a global audience and his big hopes for a second season
Based on the popular webtoon of the same name also conceived by Kang Full Moving follows two generations of people with superpowers in modern-day South Korea
Some have enhanced senses some can fly and others can generate electricity
Ryu’s character Jang Ju-Won has regenerative powers that allow him to recover from injuries
He has a very rough life Ryu told CNN describing him as almost monster-like
Ju-Won is complex to say the least
When we’re not watching him fall in love dote on his daughter and work different jobs to make ends meet we’re watching him fight for his life
In one complex action sequence Ju-Won is beat up set on fire hit by a car and stabbed multiple times while he fights a gang of people single-handedly almost reminiscent of the famous corridor scene in Park Chan-Wook’s film Oldboy
Despite some rather gory fight scenes involving the supernatural Moving isn’t just an action thriller
The heart of the series is actually an engaging narrative about family
It’s a series that can show … a mix of moments of happiness anger pain sadness and everything else in one long sitting Ryu said
While shifting back and forth from past to present weaving in the characters’ heart-warming and more often gut-wrenching backstories the drama shows parents and their children using their super abilities to protect one another from enemies
The actor says the focus on family helps Moving resonate with international audiences
We all have our family with us said Ryu
Even if you’re not married don’t have kids or your parents have passed … it provides moments where we are reminded of them
As an actor Ryu said he was drawn to Ju-Won’s wide-ranging emotions as both husband and father
In fact it appealed to him more than being an action hero
For Ryu another appeal of Moving is the hope it gives to viewers It shows the weak and powerless becoming superheroes regular looking people
It encourages viewers that they are already doing the best they can and they all have stories to tell Ryu said
Anyone and everyone has superpowers and because of that they shouldn’t be discouraged
That’s also what sets this drama apart from other popular superhero stories like Marvel’s Avengers a global franchise the actor has been a long-time fan of
While Marvel and Moving share some of the same DNA Ryu argues the latter portrays a more day-to-day image where ordinary people are working to protect their family
They are not wearing tights or uniforms
﻿Ryu said that he’d be more than willing to star in a second and even a third season of Moving And while the next instalment has yet to be announced Ryu has his fingers crossed
Kang Full jokingly told me that I should take good care of myself because there are even bigger and more spectacular scenes coming up if we do go into season two Ryu said
Moving is available on Disney+ and Hulu
