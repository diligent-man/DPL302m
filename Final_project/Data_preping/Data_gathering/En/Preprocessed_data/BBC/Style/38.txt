editor s note design for impact is a series spotlighting architectural solutions for communities displaced by the climate crisis natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies
in the arid land outside the ugandan town of yumbe where almost refugees have settled in a community known as bidi bidi architects are building the first performance and arts space of its kind
over the past seven years bidi bidi has transformed from a rapidly growing camp for refugees fleeing south sudan s civil war to a permanent settlement
the bidi bidi music arts centre which is currently under construction will be a low slung light filled brick and steel amphitheater that also houses an acoustic recording studio and music classroom
the center s sleek steel roof will serve a second purpose beyond shelter it is shaped like a funnel to collect rainwater for the local community
a tree nursery and vegetable garden will meanwhile grow outside
designed by the architecture firm hassell and localworks a design studio based in the ugandan capital kampala the center is a rare example of an architectural project dedicated to the arts rather than immediate essentials like emergency housing and healthcare facilities in a displaced community
and it could serve as a model for other settlements
xavier de kestelier global head of design at hassell told cnn that he hopes the center will become a catalyst for more of its kind
as the global refugee population has soared in recent years reaching over million in some temporary camps like bidi bidi have transitioned into permanent city like settlements
with the climate crisis intensifying weather patterns which can in turn stoke food shortages the number of refugees worldwide is only expected to grow
the bidi bidi music arts centre was conceived by the developer to org which works with vulnerable communities and displaced people to improve their quality of life
to org which works on philanthropic and creative initiatives surveyed the settlement s residents on what they wanted in their community and the response was a place for dance music and performance explained de kestelier in a phone call
the project which was showcased at the london design biennale in june follows the successful launch of another music project by to org the karibbean records recording studio in kyebando kampala which went on to produce ugandan artist zex bilangilangi s hit track ratata
why should millions of people worldwide be denied access to creative spaces simply because they have been displaced due to conflict climate change or for any other reason said nachson mimran co founder and ceo of to org in an email
of course the answer is they shouldn t
and critically there s the fact that music art dance and theater are firmly established as meaningful forms of therapy for people with ptsd post traumatic stress disorder which is endemic in bidi bidi as it is in other refugee settlements
in bidi bidi where the majority of residents are under years old there is a deep need for shared cultural spaces according to mawa zacharia erezenio who has been living in the settlement since its early days after fleeing south sudan in when his father was killed during the civil war
residing in the settlement is not an easy life he said
since arriving erezenio has co founded one of the organizations collaborating on music programming for the center sina loketa a non profit dedicated to supporting the creative and entrepreneurial endeavors of young refugees
one of the difficulties erezenio faced when he first arrived he noted was the simmering tension between displaced members of different tribes
bringing residents together through the arts can enable them to start thinking of the future rather than fighting among themselves he said
we are bringing different tribes to perform together and to exchange their cultural dances we see it as a powerful tool for bringing peace and love among the community
when i compare to and there s a great difference he added noting that his organization s work has already helped reduce the individualism he believes has been detrimental to the community
in addition to serving as a gathering point the new building needs to be as efficient as possible according to de kestelier
there is little infrastructure in place to support bidi bidi s massive population with no running water or reliable electricity supply
we wanted the building to be very low maintenance to make sure that as little as possible can go wrong he explained

to sidestep the need for artificial lighting sunlight will perforate the brick building through openings and light wells
its water system doesn t require pumps but instead uses gravity offering another source of clean water to a settlement that currently relies on well water provided by humanitarian agencies and non profits
rain water is captured in a big tank and runs down the slope where the local community can get fresh drinking water because that s been a really big issue de kestelier said
we wanted to make sure that once we build this big roof for shade we could capture all of the rainwater
in building the space de kestelier said the construction team has been sensitive to which materials might be disruptive
they opted for a prefabricated steel roof made in kampala to avoid relying on local wood the supply of which is under increased pressure because of the large settlement
for the same reason they opted for hand pressed bricks made from local soil rather than ones fired using wood fuel
but beyond practical use and sustainability de kestelier wants bidi bidi residents to have a new building that feels like their own
for me it was important that it stood out he explained citing his experience growing up in ghent belgium which has a population roughly equivalent to the settlement s and the pride he felt in the city s cultural institutions
we have an opera theater an art museum a design museum and these are quite often special buildings that make a place
floating architecture isn t the future
it s already here
so far he is happy with the response to the arts center which will be completed later this year
the local community is already calling it the mushroom which i think is great he said with a laugh
when people give it a name they own it more
erezenio is hopeful that bidi bidi and other settlements like it will see more projects that provide refugees with tools for success in addition to more immediate needs
all their dreams all their passion has been destroyed during the war he said
if we get more support and more funding we can make a lot of transformation
