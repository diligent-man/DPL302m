last week the th edition of the venice film festival opened amid the actors strike that has hollywood at a standstill rendering the usually glitzy red carpet a more muted affair
venice is one of the biggest events of the film festival circuit
often seen as the launchpad to the oscars it s also a platform for some of fashion s most memorable moments think lady gaga s iconic entrance in to promote a star is born in a voluminous pink feathered gown by valentino haute couture and zendaya s bombshell appearance in wearing nude body hugging balmain
the strikes by wga the writers guild of america and sag afra the screen actors guild and american federation of television and radio artists over issues around residuals higher wages use of artificial intelligence and more prohibit actors from promoting their films and venice is the first major festival to see a reduction in both film premieres and celebrity attendees zendaya s film challengers for example was slated to open the festival but was pulled at the last minute favoring an opening in spring instead
the impact of these reduced red carpets extends far beyond the movie business
film festivals are where movies combine with celebrities and luxury brands to create huge marketing opportunities
many top celebrities have brand ambassador roles with labels for promotional work often at high profile and highly visible events like film premieres and red carpets of which there are right now far less
celebrity hair and makeup teams are feeling the pinch too with bookings for red carpet appearances and film festivals usually an essential part of their revenue stream cancelled
while hair and makeup artists are supportive of the strike a significant percentage cannot afford to have large gaps in their calendar or find themselves out of work
some even liken the situation to the days of the covid shutdowns
veteran hollywood makeup artist rachel goodwin regularly works with actors on the film festival and red carpet circuit and was slated to accompany actor emma stone to venice to promote the movie poor things since the strike was announced celebrities haven t needed her services

we just went through the pandemic that s why it the strike feels like a particularly harsh blow she told cnn in a phone interview
we live in a feast or famine reality and people are very scared
likewise hairstylist nai vasha who covers red carpets as well as working with artists such as tracee ellis ross lupita nyong o and nicole ari parker has been left wondering how long this period of uncertainty will last
scheduled to work at the venice film festival this season her plans changed when the strike was announced
i didn t think it would make sense to travel to venice while the strike was happening she told cnn
i would be interested in seeing how festivals manage this during the strike
my heart breaks for us all right now
for many the effects of the strike were immediate
groomer and makeup artist kerrie urban who usually travels the world with celebrities to work on high profile events told cnn that a whole month of work was wiped off her calendar by the end of the first day of the strike on july
best fashion at the venice film festival
my career is about celebrity or actor based mainly red carpets press premieres and promotions and since the strike says writers and actors can t promote their work it s been a complete standstill urban said
despite the cancellations urban fully supports the strikes saying that everyone deserves to be paid fairly but adds people on my side of things were just collateral damage unfortunately nevertheless she is feeling optimistic and said that the pandemic taught her patience
we can see with barbie distributed by warner bros
pictures which is owned by cnn s parent company warner bros
discovery and oppenheimer how much people want to be entertained and want to be excited
the entertainment industry will come back it s just a matter of time she told cnn in a phone interview
indeed with no end date in sight some artists have pivoted away from entertainment to parallel industries from music and fashion to social media
ro morgan hairstylist to naomi campbell venus williams and ayo edebiri says he s not worried but added i m not working because i do red carpets and no red carpets no work morgan cut his teeth in the fashion industry and with little work in entertainment right now morgan is preparing to head to milan and paris fashion weeks where actresses and those in the fashion industry promise more work
when i saw the strike i was like i got to get ahead and pivot back to fashion where i still have clients morgan told cnn in a phone interview
nai vasha also has plans to attend fashion month as well as work on editorials to fill her fall calendar
she noted that a lot of focus will be on fashion and beauty during this time
it s a great time to shoot campaigns and commercials where celebrities can still interact with brands with which they work
while strike guidelines don t allow for commercial promotional work for film or tv projects they do not prohibit other opportunities such as fashion week appearances campaign work for brands and sporting events
with many actors in need of new outlets to fulfil any brand commitments during the strike we can expect the upcoming fashion month which starts tomorrow in new york to offer actors a useful alternative to film festival red carpets
the four weeks of non stop shows events and parties will be important for brands and celebrities to keep their relationships strong stay visible and relevant
cannes red carpet looks all the fashion from the th film festival
but the high visibility of the strikes has shone a spotlight on wage discrepancies and the unfair treatment of a large percentage of the creative workforce in america
with no clear resolution in sight as a pared back venice festival prepares to close and toronto international film festival prepares to kick off we can expect little change to the situation for the time being
ultimately this is a business so the money will go wherever the people s attention goes goodwin told cnn
i hope people still want to see their favorite stars on the red carpet talking about their project based on the recent barbie press tour people still want that
we still want to dream and that s my job to help people dream a little
