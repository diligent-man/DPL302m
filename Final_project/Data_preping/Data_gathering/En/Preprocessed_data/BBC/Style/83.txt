When Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui heads to the International Space Station ISS next year he will have two new skincare items in his bag that are especially designed for the rigors of space travel
The face wash and lotion are part of a Cosmology line unveiled on Monday by Japanese cosmetic company POLA and ANA Holdings the parent company of All Nippon Airways
The products were created after the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency JAXA called for skincare solutions that could be used in the resource scarce low gravity and extremely dry conditions of outer space
The two companies began working on the range in and JAXA gave them the green light to bring their designs to life last March
To save water the face wash is made to simply be wiped off while the lotion was designed to remain in a semi solid state so it won’t scatter in low gravity

The products are not the first cosmetics to head to outer space In former NASA astronaut Joan Higginbotham talked to InStyle about using Vaseline Cetaphil foundation blush mascara and lipstick during missions while Estée Lauder has sent a skincare serum into outer space as part of a commercial partnership with the American space agency
Astronauts in space — and even after they return to Earth — have reported experiencing burning itchy dry and sensitive skin
The new products’ creators said they hope to improve astronauts’ quality of life in space and said their range had been tested by flight attendants on ANA aircrafts given the similarities between the conditions in flight and on the ISS
The Cosmology Space Crew Kit — a set featuring smaller versions of the cleansing wash and lotion — will be made available to the public in October while the regular sized products will go on sale next January
POLA President Miki Oikawa told reporters in Tokyo he hoped the products could also be of use in other resource scarce situations like evacuation centers during natural disasters
