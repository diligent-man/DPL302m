editor s note in snap we look at the power of a single photograph chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made
it was the summer of
hong kong s humidity already oppressive was intensified in the dark maze like alleyways of an unruly enclave known as kowloon walled city
then the most densely populated place on earth its buildings were packed together so tightly that barely a slither of sky was visible from the ground
searching for a moment of respite from the heat and chaos below photographer greg girard found himself on the roof of one of the enclave s many illegally built high rises among a tangled thicket of television antennas
he wasn t alone
in the walled city the delineation of private and public spaces wasn t always so clear girard recalled in a video call adding that the roof was an escape for many of its residents to relax do laundry or watch planes land at kai tak international airport
once you get up to the rooftop everything sort of changes
the vista opens up and it s cooler there s a breeze
navigating the narrow gaps between buildings with planks of wood children would skip and play between the webs of laundry lines and satellites no one seemed to think of it as a dangerous place even though there were no guardrails or anything like that said girard
on that particular summer day some children spotted girard s camera and approached him
when he turned the lens on them they began performing and pulling faces
he snapped several shots describing the final one which he eventually chose to publish as the moment when they had settled into this face off with me
in the photograph a young girl barefoot and wearing a blue dress stares into the camera
her face is relaxed and her hands are wrapped around an antenna pole as if she s about to swing
in the backdrop her friend strikes a defiant stance hands on her hips while another is in the throes of messing around bent double in a playful squat
i thought the image captured the kids indifference to the potential danger of the rooftop while at the same time sort of owning their territory and confronting me while goofing around said girard adding it was just quite an average day up on there
the playfulness of the children juxtaposed with the jagged antennas and stark concrete of their surroundings seem to epitomized the spirit of kowloon walled city the photographer said
it wasn t an ideal playground but that never seemed to bother anyone which was of course very much the spirit of the walled city making the best of and even enjoying life in a situation most other people would be horrified by
girard first visited kowloon walled city in while on a shoot at the nearby airport
at that time around buildings up to stories high were packed precariously into a space of square miles
most of the towers were built without proper foundations or regard for safety codes
this strange vertical village wasn t really supposed to exist said girard explaining the kowloon walled city was the product of a historical and political quirk
although the enclave was situated in the middle of hong kong then a british colony imperial officials refused to take legal responsibility for it
as such the walled city remained technically subject to chinese rule though this was never enforced
that allowed it to become something you couldn t have dreamed up girard added
existing in ambiguity for nearly a century it had a reputation for illicit dealings and was infamous for its triads drug dens brothels and unlicensed dentistry
but by the time the canadian photographer made his first visit to the thriving city in triad control had waned and these characterizations were he said very out of date
it might have been true at one time he added
but his enduring memory of the place was the community that lived there
you quickly realize that it s just a place where folks are trying to get by like any other working class part of hong kong
girard was determined to demystify the so called city of darkness particularly after the colonial government announced plans in to demolish it
he spent four years documenting the walled city with fellow photographer ian lambot with the pair eventually publishing a book of their images in
early on girard decided to photograph the series in color and used portable lighting equipment similar to the kind he used to capture celebrities and ceos for glossy magazine portraits
the only pictures you saw of the walled city at the time tended to be in black and white and they made the place look as bad as possible in keeping with the reputation of the walled city as a dangerous squalid slum said girard
when it came to capturing people s day to day lives and images of residents shopkeepers and factory owners the photographer wanted to use a more even handed approach he added
girard documented among much else the blurred chaos of noodle and fish ball factories a young child inspecting his grazed knee on the counter of his family s grocery store and a barber curling a client s hair
while initial reactions to his presence were often frosty there was a palpable unwelcomeness to outsiders he recalled residents eventually allowed him into their cramped apartments
his guiding principle girard said was to try to show it for what it really was since rumor and myths were the only things that were known about the place
when the walled city was razed from to that was supposed to be the end of it
but in the decades since the enclave has arguably garnered more interest than it ever did while standing
in girard and lambot published a revisited edition of their book that explored the city s legacy in popular culture including as an inspiration for fictional dystopias in video games and films such as call of duty black ops and batman begins
the walled city was this jumping off point for an imaginary city where the normal rules don t apply said girard
there has been renewed interest in architectural circles too the unregulated organic construction that made kowloon walled city a dystopia to live in is now being examined as a source of innovation due to its resourceful use of limited space and cheap or second hand materials said girard
the limitations of that place certainly spurred a lot of creative responses in building terms to the question of what to do in a place that no one cares about or pays attention to except the residents girard added
the site of the walled city has since been transformed into a public park which opened in
quiet and uncrowded it is in many ways the opposite of what it replaced providing a much needed reprieve from the clamor of a city desperately short on public space
open air chess pavilions and banyan shaded ponds surround the old yamen building a relic of the th century chinese garrison city that once stood on the site and the only structure to survive the demolition
inside the building girard s famous rooftop photo is blown up to fill an entire wall accompanied by an audio track of children laughing and the roar of airplane engines
the memory of a vibrant community immortalized by photographers like girard lingers
ongoing interest in the walled city is girard suggests because of the spirit it encapsulates the aptitude for survival even in the harshest of circumstances
it still continues to fascinate he said
and that s wonderful
