if the s had red lipstick and pin curls and the s had brown gloss and tightliner then the s was all about fluffy brows and dewy skin
between and many beauty enthusiasts preferences shifted high coverage foundation was largely displaced by multi step skincare routines brow gel replaced heavy brow pomade and lips were delicately stained rather than boldly painted
the barely there look was surprisingly big business too
glossier a direct to consumer cosmetics company launched in by us businesswoman emily weiss pioneered this new aesthetic
at glossier beauty marks were celebrated freckles were lionized and makeup application became as free form as finger painting
the firm s skincare first makeup second mantra fashion forward millennial pink product design and early championing of new it girls like model paloma elsesser catapulted it from cult favorite to industry mainstay
the company reported growth between and
and over the years it has launched best selling products such as boy brow milky jelly cleanser and glossier you the brand s first and only fragrance which reportedly sold at a rate of one every seconds in
glossier also boasts significant star power
beyonc serena williams michelle obama and reese witherspoon have all been pictured wearing the makeup brand to red carpet events like the oscars and the grammys
lila moss sydney sweeny gigi hadid and sza are also known to keep a product or two in their purse
in march glossier was valued at billion
but by the brand s us sales were down compared to the previous year
last year glossier laid off a third of its corporate staff citing certain missteps in overhiring
the tale of the company s recent decline is the subject of glossy a new book by new york based journalist marisa meltzer
my guiding principle was to not simplify the story in any way meltzer told cnn in a phone interview
i wanted to show it in all its nuance and complexity
the book attributes glossier s current woes to a series of stumbles from lax hiring decisions scaling at break neck speed and weiss alleged fixation with establishing glossier as a tech company to lackluster product launches and even entirely discontinued product lines remember glossier play
for meltzer the brand fell victim to something that often trips up companies leading the zeitgeist an evolving landscape
testimonies from anonymous glossier employees also weave a familiar yarn of performative startups where complimentary coconut waters were prioritized over competitive salaries complete with allegations of racism and mistreatment
in the company and emily weiss apologized to former retail workers saying they had failed to ensure that all voices are heard and protected within our internal community glossier did not respond to cnn s repeated request for comment about these historical allegations
but glossy isn t just a beauty brand biography it s a forensic cross examination of an era defining company and how it embodied a moment in wider culture
the book s narrative addresses what it describes as the cult of the s girlboss symbolized by weiss as well as nasty gal s sophia amoruso manrepeller s leandra medine and audrey gelman of the wing all of whom were celebrated for their female entrepreneurship before facing allegations and in some cases lawsuits from former employees complaining of workplace discrimination
in a spokesperson for sophia amoruso and nasty gal denied these allegations but on recho omondi s cutting room floor podcast in manrepeller s leandra medine admitted she sucked as a leader and said complaints came down to her being an immature a hole audrey gelman stepped down as ceo of the wing in june after penning an opinion piece titled where i got it wrong in which she states we prioritized business growth over cultural growth
meltzer unpacks the vaguely fetishized and infantilizing girlboss term without too much chastizing
the phenomenon was a way for these women to be taken seriously even if it was demeaning she told cnn in a video interview
it was a vehicle for them to talk about themselves as businesswomen rather than having to do the long profiles for women s magazines talking about who they were dating
glossy is also a fascinating portrait of one of the most prolific female ceos of the last decade
weiss began as an ambitious and accomplished intern at teen vogue who made a cameo on the early s reality tv series the hills in meltzer s unabashed account weiss is depicted as whip smart charismatic and driven as well as somewhat guarded and self conscious
there s no easy way to talk about the power dynamic of writing about someone and they don t necessarily want to be written about meltzer told cnn
the book recounts how scheduled interviews became anodyne tours of retail locations or were forcibly switched to off the record last minute
i wish she had been more open the author continued
there was often a feeling of her trying to run out the clock until time was up doing the absolute least
cnn reached out to weiss via glossier about her participation in the book but the company did not respond to requests for comment
by beauty s needle had shifted again
celebrities with gen z followings began crowding the market with wildly popular offerings selena gomez s rare beauty or hailey bieber s brand rhode for example while young consumers became more interested in adorning their acne with yellow star shaped stickers than masking zits with concealer
glossier defined the aesthetic of the s wrote meltzer
but as the s came about it started to feel stale all the sans serif font and glossierpink
but meltzer didn t set out to write a company post mortem
nor could she glossier still generates millions of dollars in monthly revenue is stocked by beauty giant sephora and operates a dozen brick and mortar stores around the world
when the company opened a new location in soho new york this past february crowds queued around the block
in january the brand released its you scented deodorant and just last month launched its second ever foundation with shades to much fanfare the first in debuted with just five
and although weiss is no longer glossier s ceo she continues to sit on the board as executive chairwoman
everything has a lifespan meltzer said
i think it was the end of the wide eyed youth of the company
it s not the glossier of or it has to prove itself as relevant but it also has so much potential to be rediscovered by new markets new generations
