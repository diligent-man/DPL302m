in the music video for their latest single dtdtgmgn members of south korean band eternity dance in perfect time to a bubblegum pop beat in a neon pink room decorated with school uniforms and celebrity posters
the dizzying camera movements and quick paced scene changes are typical of the k pop genre that has become a global phenomenon in recent years
hold me tight lean on my shoulder one member sings
but the group s fans cannot do either of those things physically speaking because none of eternity s bandmates are real
built using ai technology eternity is one of the latest south korean acts pushing the boundary between real and virtual entertainment
and the group s creator and management company pulse believes that computer generated stars have a significant edge over their real life counterparts
as with most popular k pop groups eternity s members include a group leader vocalists rappers and dancers
but one member in particular zae in can do it all
zae in has a combination of characteristics that most human artists would be hard stretched to pull off said the firm s ceo park ji eun
she can sing very well rap very well and she can be creative as a fashion designer
and she s a natural born actress
with the help of real time face swapping technology and an ai generated voice zae in is played by different people including actors singers and dancers who lend their talents to her avatar as needed
in one video posted on zae in s instagram account for example she deftly rides a longboard beside seoul s han river
for the video her creators filmed the stunt with a stand in whose face was later swapped out for zae in
there is the pop music zae in actress zae in reporter zae in the virtual star told cnn in a zoom interview during which she was played by an actor though pulse said that its ai software can recreate zae in s voice and generate speech without human input
various zae ins exist so our unique advantage is that we can do what one person cannot
the only thing we cannot do is sign an autograph she added her eyes smiling
forever young beautiful and scandal free the rise of south korea s virtual influencers
real time face swapping and early forms of deepfake technology have existed for almost a decade
in that time virtual influencers like lil miquela and south korea s own rozy have gained large online followings in the fashion and music spaces
but the latest advancements in ai generated video and audio are making it easier for companies like pulse to create convincing virtual characters while advances in generative ai programs like chatgpt are eliminating the need for stars like zae in to be played by anyone at all
the team at pulse began the process of bringing eternity to life by designing its members looks
park s team generated unique digital faces inspired by existing korean celebrities before dividing them into four categories dubbed sexy cute intelligent and innocent and narrowing the selection down to via an online poll
using deepfake and motion capture technology pulse then produced the band s first music video to accompany the ironically titled track i m real in
reaction to the video was mixed
many social media users felt the band members facial expressions looked unnatural and divorced from their bodies while others cited the uncanny valley effect whereby viewers are discomforted by things that resemble humans but aren t
but five months later when pulse released eternity s next music video no filter followers noted that the group was almost indistinguishable from the real thing
i m surprised how realistic they sound and the visuals look more realistic than the debut song reads the most liked comment on youtube
dtdtgmgn which came out last october represented another huge leap in quality
until last year the face was the only virtual part of the performer but today we can make whole full body images based on ai technology park said adding that no filter was also composed using ai although humans then edited the song and wrote lyrics
sm entertainment the agency behind k pop megastars like super junior girls generation and exo among others has also been experimenting with ai
in the company debuted aespa a group comprising four human artists and their virtual counterparts
after the band s launch sm s founder lee soo man declared that the future of entertainment is celebrity and robot
how k pop group newjeans became an overnight fashion favorite
elsewhere bts management company hybe used ai to tweak one of its singer s pronunciation and pitch before releasing one of his songs in six languages korean english spanish chinese japanese and vietnamese
and earlier this year metaverse entertainment an agency formed by video game publisher netmarble and sm entertainment s parent company kakao entertainment debuted a virtual girl group mave
unlike eternity which relies on straightforward face swaps mave s four members were generated from scratch using cgi
metaverse entertainment used ai technology to generate faces merging the features and hairstyles deemed most desirable into four final characters
the company employed motion capture technology to record real life k pop performances that a deep learning program then used to animate music videos
the group s vocals are part human and part ai generated said metaverse entertainment s chief technical officer kang sung ku
our goal is to create fully ai driven virtual humans that are really believable he told cnn
the music video for mave s first single pandora has already racked up million views on youtube since its release in january
virtual popstars may enjoy an advantage over human ones when it comes to engaging with their fanbases
advancements in ai language programs could make it possible for fans to speak with and even build up their own personal relationship with their idols kang said
they will remember what we talked about yesterday and can continue talking about things from previous conversations he said drawing a comparison between his firm s ai creations and iphone s virtual assistant siri
they will remember you and know about you and they will talk with you based on that information
metaverse entertainment is already experimenting with this idea via apps that allow users to directly interact with mave
the band s members currently speak korean english french and indonesian indicative of key fanbases and target markets though they could theoretically speak any number of languages
there are some things i cannot tell even my best friends but maybe i could tell a personalized ai which can comfort me and care about me kang said
i think it ll be good for everybody
the development could certainly be good for companies like kang s
the k pop industry is underpinned by a laborious trainee system in which hopefuls are molded from a young age often going through years of costly dance and music classes before debuting
according to the wall street journal sm entertainment spent approximately million taking girls generation to market in agencies must invest in lessons studio space styling and sometimes even cosmetic procedures for potential band members costs not required for virtual talents
furthermore computer generated pop stars will never fall ill age or become embroiled in contract disputes or tabloid scandals
but there is little chance of major agencies replacing their real life bands anytime soon said kang acknowledging that some quarters of k pop s fandom have reacted badly to ai groups
meet the k pop stars taking on the art world
criticism was about replacing current idols with virtual ones they thought current idols might lose their jobs kang said adding that some fans will always prefer human artists
eternity s creator park agreed comparing the emergence of ai to the invention of photography in the th century many painters were afraid of the new technology but today we still have painters
i think bts will never be afraid of virtual idols they re just new content
