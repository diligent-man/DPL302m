maybe it s the ascendance of fast fashion or the increasing reach of industry conglomerates often seen at the expense of smaller labels and independent creatives
it could be due to the frenetic turnover of brands and microtrends spinning amid social media forward news cycles what s that old adage one day you re in and the next you re out or wider economic headwinds
or perhaps it s all of the above is a challenging time to launch a career in fashion
but for bishme cromartie winner of the recent all stars season of bravo s long running fashion reality tv competition project runway time is relative history s in the making and the moment is now
i m one of those people that like to stay in the present cromartie told cnn but i also like to travel to the future a little bit to see how i want things to look so i m already moving to get myself there
new york fashion week highlights from the spring summer runways
speaking with cnn style both before and after his project runway win and debut at new york fashion week debut cromartie discussed both the road behind him and what s ahead why reality tv was the right starting point and how he intends to make his mark in the fashion business
i ve just been training and preparing for this moment he explained
i know i m already there and i m just catching the people up
bishme cromartie the year old me is so happy right now he always wanted to be on project runway and he always wanted to showcase a collection at new york fashion week
the year old me today i m balancing both
i m truly at a place where i m like this is me and i want you guys to embrace it
when i first went to los angeles where my studio is currently based no one knew who i was
no one could pronounce my name properly and now i m working on video and movie sets
but i m still pushing and showcasing to people that i want to convert being a project runway winner into a brand
right now it s celebrate time but i m already in the group chat asking my team what can we do to keep the ball rolling
as there are only three of us building out the team is vital and i m trying to decide whether to stay in los angeles or come to new york
i m just trying to get my foot in the door so that i can keep running
everyone is in the same boat is designing fashion worth going into debt
i ve always had this game plan and after i started saying what i would do i started moving as if i was already doing it
project runway takes energy
it is like a bootcamp but it s also a cheat sheet for moving into the fashion industry
there s going to be hard challenges there s going to be long days there s going to be critics
it s funny because i used to love myspace and aol chatrooms and all that stuff
i m good at trolling
the trollers can t out troll me
a lot of times people do try to bring you down but it s part of the game
it s part of the fashion industry
you have to take that on
and i don t want to be known as a project runway winner forever
i m giving myself a year to two and then i want to keep making grander and bigger things far far away from reality tv
i think the way you do that is being consistent
one of my dreams has always been to be a creative director for another brand i would love to be worrying about my collection debuting here at another new york fashion week and then having to fly out to milan or paris for another show
i think i had that prize money spent way before it even before the show even happened
i had a list of expenses
a lot of it will be going into building up the brand manufacturing product development consumer research i have to pace myself i have so many ideas and it s like we re not there yet i have shoe ideas bag ideas i have ideas about how i can integrate ai into my runways
i can t do it all so right now my mantra is to work with what i have and also know that the funding will be coming bigger than what it is now
i remember times i didn t even have what i have that
there s not that many black designers that you can look at say as a reference
my biggest inspiration was virgil abloh
i felt like virgil did so much to inform and inspire and try to showcase how we could be ourselves but still present beautiful garments
bishme cromartie
going through business meetings or getting feedback or told no over the past year i m just like well after after the show ends you guys are gonna change your mind
come back to me then and we ll talk and now i m seeing these people who said no call back and want to reschedule meetings
the buyers the investors they re coming my way but i also know how to negotiate and i want to make sure that i m in the right thing not taking all of the opportunities but the right ones
i ve been waiting a long time for this but i know that you can f ck it up really fast
i have to remind myself that i m already making an impact in the fashion community
everything i ve been doing until now i ve learned from myself
i m self taught
i went to an inner city school in baltimore i was designing high school gowns while i was in the ninth grade
the first people who trusted my design eye were my community my peers
the thing that helps me stay on track is that i know where i m from and i know what i want to do to help those who may look like me and have the same dream they want to chase
how can i make it less hard for them
if i can get here from where i m from and the things i ve learned then anyone can
honestly you just have to keep going at it
