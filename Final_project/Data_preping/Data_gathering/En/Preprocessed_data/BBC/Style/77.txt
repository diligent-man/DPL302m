i never thought i would hear tom selleck s mustache discussed in the same breath as a royal wig made of pubic hair but the museum of decorative arts in paris is full of surprises
both are part of the museum s exhibition des cheveux et des poils which translates to hair and body hair or fur the museum s latest attempt to explore the relationship between the human body and fashion recent shows have interrogated footwear the rules of attire and undergarments
boasting works dating from the th century to today the show in the museum s words demonstrates how hairstyles and the grooming of human hair have contributed to the construction of appearances for centuries
a fair share of the unusual is on display including a full body suit that resembles a blond wookie and several wigs shaped like animals
while selleck s mustache remains attached to his upper lip the display dedicated to his facial hair includes footage from magnum p i elsewhere the aforementioned royal wig worn by britain s charles ii and supposedly made of hair from his mistresses nether regions is represented by an empty stand with the original believed to have been destroyed
the big business of brows
despite bordering on the bizarre the exhibition uses these pieces to explain how hair has long been exploited by fashion and used to express identity
hair wherever it may be has been a tool of both self expression and oppression of protest and societal progress
for rachael gibson a journalist who runs the popular instagram account the hair historian the exhibition is a welcome opportunity to examine beauty trends in an academic way that is usually only reserved for fashion
there are fashion museums all over the world and fashion history is studied at universities but quite often beauty gets left out of the conversation she told cnn
there are so many weird and wonderful things that happened within hair and beauty on a global and historical scale that tell us so much about what was happening in the world at the time
on the day i visited a few dozen people had lined up ahead of the exhibition s a m
opening
we entered a dimly lit room where portraits of women ordered chronologically adorned the walls
the progression showed the evolution of hair styles in medieval europe when most adhered to christian norms requiring heads to be covered with a hood or veil
this infamous s hairstyle is seeing a resurgence in young men
come the th and th centuries women s hair was increasingly on display and in particular french women s once hidden locks grew ever taller reaching new heights in the s as seen in jean baptiste andre gautier dagoty s painting portrait of a woman though the eye is drawn to the subject s hazel eyes and thick eyebrows it s impossible to ignore the towering hairstyle she is sporting a high roll built over a crinoline cushion
requiring significant preparation the high roll was considered a status symbol among the french elite and eventually made its way to england and the united states
long hair remained in vogue throughout the th century but not in all circles as evidenced by a macabre party theme that emerged in following a period of the french revolution known as the reign of terror
relatives of those executed by guillotine attended so called bals des victimes victims balls at which they in the words of one witness at the time cut their hair short around the neck just as the executioner cuts the hair of victims
the cropped cut became a style sported by other daring women of the period
a painting of one of the era s fashion icons madame fouler completed by french painter louis leopold boilly in around shows the countess sporting a short hairdo that became known as the titus french research non profit organization the napoleon foundation quotes a hairdresser at the time stating that the style s purposeful disorder gives an air of youth and replaces all ornaments jewels and feathers
trends in hair like clothing are of course cyclical
short hair for women made a comeback again in the s with the bob first for practical reasons women and nurses working in world war i found it easier and later as a statement of independence and equality
these cycles are evident in men s hair too
at the exhibition i overheard a young woman looking at the subject of a th century portrait by flemish renaissance painter pieter pourbus
that looks like a hipster she said
the subject of men s body hair in art and media is also examined
why the exhibition asks have so many of history s most famous depictions of men such as michelangelo s david portrayed them without any body hair whatsoever even the painting of samson and delilah by french artist joseph desire court shows the biblical figure famous for drawing strength from his luxuriant hair without any on his body
as someone whose friends often joke that i m wearing a sweater at the beach i was particularly interested in the answer
roman obsession with hairlessness revealed as more than pairs of tweezers discovered in britain
according to a museum display hairless male bodies in art were synonymous with the idealized body while the hairy body was associated with virility or even triviality traditionally the exhibition also noted men s body hair was only displayed in athletic portrayals erotic illustrations and medical engravings
and while students in th century art schools were instructed to draw what was in front of them complete with hair they were told that in paintings and sculptures destined for public exhibition body hair considered repulsive must not appear according to the museum text
the ideal reads an exhibition note underneath a portrait of a nude male model has long been of a hairless body
while a blow to my self esteem the comment encapsulates the main theme of the exhibition hair anywhere can be many things social signifier act of rebellion function of convenience but rarely has it ever been just hair
