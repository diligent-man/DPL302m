a painting valued at just two years ago is now expected to fetch up to million at auction after being identified as the work of the dutch master rembrandt
the adoration of the kings has been virtually unseen since the s when it first came to light
it was acquired by collector j c h
heldring in amsterdam in
his widow sold it to a german family in where it remained until it was sold by christie s in amsterdam two years ago
at the time of the sale christie s attributed the biblical scene to the circle of rembrandt suggesting it had been carried out by a student or an artist close to the famous painter and estimated its value at between and
the monochromatic painting which measures x inches x centimeters was purchased by an anonymous buyer for at the christie s sale
although that was more than times the painting s estimated value at the time it is now expected to fetch millions more after emerging as a work of great significance by the dutch painter according to a press release from sotheby s
after the anonymous buyer consigned it to sotheby s the auction house embarked on an month research project to arrive at the painting s true attribution and value
the examination which involved x rays and infrared imaging as well as intensive discussions with leading rembrandt scholars led sotheby s to conclude the painting is an autograph work by rembrandt it now values the work at between million and million million million
the auction house believes it was painted early in rembrandt s career around when he would have been about and living in the dutch city of leiden
the vast majority of rembrandt s works hang in museums around the world and almost all of those that have come to auction over the past three decades have been portraits or studies of single character heads according to the sotheby s release
as such the adoration of the kings which depicts the encounter between the three wise men and the baby jesus is a fantastic opportunity in the art world george gordon co chairman of old master paintings worldwide at sotheby s told cnn
in a phone call with cnn he said i would say that it s particularly significant because it adds to our understanding of rembrandt at this crucial date in his development and career when he was clearly very ambitious and developing very quickly as an artist
the earliest reference to the painting appears to be from the inventory of a collector in amsterdam constantijn ranst
it was then offered for sale in and again in after which it disappeared from view until the mid th century

it was included in museum exhibitions and referenced as a rembrandt work by leading rembrandt scholars in the s but in german art historian kurt bauch who only knew the painting from a black and white photograph described it as a product of the rembrandt school and omitted it from from the catalogue raisonn he was compiling
thereafter the painting was entirely overlooked and completely ignored in the rembrandt literature according to sothebys
gordon told cnn that those bidding at the christie s auction in must have thought it was much better than the description and that it might well be a rembrandt
sotheby s close examination revealed a number of changes and revisions that rembrandt made including to the baby jesus halo and the virgin mary s headdress according to the auction house

very few narrative paintings by rembrandt remain in private hands making this an opportunity for a private collector or an institution that is as rare as it is exciting gordon said in the news release
this sophisticated painting is in equal measure a product of rembrandt s brush and his intellect
all the hallmarks of his style in the late s are evident both in the visible painted surface and in the underlying layers revealed by science showing multiple changes in the course of its creation and casting fresh light on how he thought he added
the painting is currently on show at sotheby s in hong kong after which it will travel on to new york los angeles and london where it will be auctioned on december
