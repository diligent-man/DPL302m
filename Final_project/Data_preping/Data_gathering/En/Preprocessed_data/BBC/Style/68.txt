Beige boring and a bit too complicated — in the s personal computers had about as much charisma as an underwhelming date
Compaq and IBM dominated the market churning out homogenous boxy monitors keyboards and modems
But out of the Bondi blue in August soon after its cofounder Steve Jobs had returned to a company in crisis Apple introduced a bold new design that drastically shifted our relationship with technology
Twenty-five years ago today the unusual jewel-toned line of iMac G desktops came onto the tech scene shaped like an egg and with a -inch CRT display the intricacies of its hardware visible beneath a translucent plastic shell
Not Geek one of its print ads proclaimed
Not only was the first line of iMacs meant to be easy to use at a time when home computers were still largely marketed to businesses and tech enthusiasts the computers were easy on the eyes too
In television commercials the iMac slowly spun around — presented as an object to be objectified
It was the first machine that was pitched to ordinary people ordinary consumers to put in their homes said Leander Kahney editor and publisher of the blog Cult of Mac
And it looked like something from outer space from ‘The Jetsons’… Very futuristic very exciting design
The iMac G was all about the candy colors
It was all about having this desire explained Paola Antonelli senior curator of design and architecture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York which has the G in its permanent collection
You would not get disappointed when you got the object
From the campaign to the packaging that was Jobs’ genius
Today we’re well accustomed to signaling style and status with our devices
Centerpiece desktops luminescent ever-thinner smart phones technicolor gaming setups
But the iMac G was arguably the first fashionable computer becoming a late ’s and YK staple with around million units sold before it was retired in
It became entrenched in pop culture with cameos in movies like Men in Black Mean Girls and of course a supporting role in Zoolander The files are IN the computer
The iMac’s designer Jony Ive was a key figure in the curation of our personal devices during his tenure at Apple which he left in to start his own design firm
Influenced by Dieter Rams the German designer who prized clarity and simplicity of form Ive — with input from Jobs — developed clean striking silhouettes
Ive’s designs for Apple later evolved to spotless white plastic computers then grayscale aluminum leaving bursts of color to small devices like iPod Minis
But the iMac G — followed by its offshoots the Clamshell iBook laptop and Power Mac G tower — ruled as a visual icon of ’s tech which saw everything from gaming consoles to point-and-shoot cameras become vividly hued exhibitionists
Lego is heading back to the ’s with a -piece model ‘Pac-Man’ arcade cabinet
Apple recognized that fashion and design and aesthetics were some of the most important factors when the whole industry was ignoring those things Kahney said
The funny thing is I think the G looks really dated today — it’s like ‘Oh my God look at that late ’s computer
Still when asked if he owned one Kahney replied enthusiastically Oh hell yeah — a Blueberry edition from
The iMac G as we know it however nearly wasn’t made
Though Apple had been buoyed by the release of the original Macintosh computer in it was hindered by other flops — like the Lisa computer — and was barely cracking at behemoth IBM’s market share into the ’s
Jobs was ousted from the company he co-founded in over boardroom drama with then-CEO John Sculley and didn’t return for over a decade launching the startup NeXT in the interim
When he came back to lead in at first as a temporary CEO it was the beginning of a long battle at Apple to change the culture of the company said Kahney who has authored biographies on both Jobs and Ive
They took it from an engineering- and marketing-driven company… to a design-driven company
The iMac was originally code-named Columbus internally because it was the start of a new world according to Kahney
Still as he wrote in his biography on Ive Jobs at first rejected the egg-shaped model
But he warmed to its playfulness over time and Ive continued down the path designing its see-through exterior to make it feel accessible to consumers as well as adding a handle on top a detail later carried through for the much-lighter iBook laptop
The handle was ostensibly so that you could pick it up and carry it around… the thing weighed pounds — no one was picking up an iMac Kahney said
But the handle gave people permission to touch the machine
And it was a real stroke of genius… Ive’s designs are all very tactile
They’re designed to be held and touched
Jobs’ decisions in the name of simplicity included some gambles in the machine’s specs from controversially ditching a floppy drive to relying on USB connections — then a nascent technology — over other standard ports
But one of its biggest simplifications was key to its success the ease of Internet access hence the ‘i’ in the name iMac
As another of its famous commercials promised Step one Plug in
Step three There is no step three The iMac came with everything a user needed to use the computer and get online including an internal modem and stereo speakers as well as a mouse and keyboard
Other computers required a laundry list of choices according to Jens Muller author of the book The Computer which traces a visual history of computing technology
When the Internet became popular and widely available for end consumers in the second half of the ’s it was just perfect timing
It was a ready-to-use-computer and it came with the Internet he said
Apple brought it down to one decision Pick a color
After the iMac was first announced in May excitement mounted
Apple’s stock soared just ahead of the iMac’s release and not even critical reviews about the lack of a floppy drive and its price tag roughly today halted momentum
Having budgeted million just to market the iMac the company’s influential campaigns of the era are burned into collective memory Launched a year before the iMac’s debut Think Different a potent response to IBM’s tagline Think celebrated renegade figures of history to drum up the appeal of the Apple brand
Then came the wave of ads celebrating the iMac’s elegance and ease — the MoMA’s Paola Antonelli draws attention in particular to one of the beautiful ads showing the computers from above arranged like flower petals — positioning it as the panacea for the drab world of PCs
The magic of Apple products according to Antonelli has always been convincing you that it was worth it to pay more to get that type of quality
But not only quality that type of interaction design she explained
How we communicate with our technology is a topic Antonelli has long explored particularly through the MoMA exhibition Talk to Me which explored our evolving personal relationship with tech and how devices like computers can cultivate emotional connections with their owners
In the digital age we’ve always had a rapport with objects… we’ve come to also expect more of a dialogue or more of a companionship rather than just a presence Antonelli said
That idea of companionship with objects was introduced by Apple
When Apple released its first Macintosh computer — a simple box that evoked a robot’s head — in it was almost like a pet that you could have at home she explained
With the introduction of the first iMacs Apple had created a delightful and cuddly shape — drawing comparisons in the press at the time to the beloved and personable Star Wars droid R-D
And three years later the company rolled out a new palm-sized musical friend starting an era in which its products have never been far from reach
Though over the years the visual language of the iMac G may have faded — today’s iMacs are closer descendants of the long-necked streamlined G — its legacy of vibrant colors have resurfaced in iPhones and iMacs the latter in pastels rather than fruit hues in
Rumors of colorful MacBook Airs also circulated last year but have as yet failed to materialize
Still with YK aesthetics back in the mix younger generations becoming devotees of vintage tech and new product lines feeling well repetitive perhaps it’s time for the wonderful weirdness of the G to inspire once again
