Tokyo resident Hiroshi Ono was shocked when he heard about plans to redevelop Meiji Jingu Gaien the famous Meiji Shrine’s outer garden which serves as one of the Japanese capital’s most beloved parks
The Jingu Gaien is ours — and our kids’ — cultural inheritance he told CNN last month at a rally organized to oppose the project
Pushing through a redevelopment plan without properly consulting citizens is unfair
It felt like the decision was made behind closed doors
Located in the heart of Tokyo the landscaped district lies just east of the Meiji Shrine one of the Shinto religion’s most important sites
Completed in it was built exclusively with public donations and volunteer labor to commemorate Emperor Meiji great-grandfather of the current Emperor Naruhito
It is also home to the Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium the sport’s spiritual home in Japan and a baseball stadium where Babe Ruth famously played in
Its centerpiece however is the Ginkgo Avenue a promenade lined with ginkgo trees many over a century old which campaigners argue are now at risk
In February the Tokyo Metropolitan Government approved a -billion-yen billion plan to redevelop a -hectare portion of the site
The project which will take over a decade to complete will see the aging rugby and baseball stadiums razed and rebuilt
A new hotel by the latter stadium will stand next to a pair of almost -meter-tall -foot skyscrapers containing office space and upmarket serviced apartments as well as another -meter -foot tower
The world’s new largest office building is bigger than the Pentagon
Work officially commenced in March and developers have since pledged to protect the iconic row of ginkgo trees and preserve and improve greenery around the proposed sports hub
But the plan has sparked public anger demonstrations and even lawsuits from outraged Tokyo residents
Since last February over people have signed a petition calling for authorities to withdraw support for the project
Last month the International Council on Monuments and Sites ICOMOS a UNESCO advisory body issued a heritage alert for Jingu Gaien
Citing the potential destruction of approximately trees and open park space the organization warned of irreversible destruction of cultural heritage
Tokyo authorities called the ICOMOS alert one-sided though it subsequently asked the project developers to present a more detailed plan before felling any trees
Last Friday the real estate firm Mitsui Fudosan which is leading the project issued a response saying it would elaborate on conservation efforts and that plans to plant new trees would ensure Jingu Gaien is sustainable for the next years
Straddling Tokyo’s downtown Shinjuku and Minato districts the Jingu Gaien was designed as a forest for the people according to ICOMOS Japan while the Jingu Naien or inner garden contains a sacred Eternal Forest
From its creation until the end of World War II the outer garden was owned by Japan’s national government and managed by the shrine
But after the country’s surrender the American occupation controlled the site until Meiji Jingu’s religious leaders took responsibility on condition that it remain open to the public explained Naoko Nishikawa a campaigner and editor-in-chief of Kenchiku a Japanese architecture journal
Nishikawa believes that the commercial nature of the redevelopment breaks the promise of keeping the Jingu Gaien as a public space
But Shinji Isoya a landscape architect and member of the Meiji Jingu board of trustees argued that the project is essential for the shrine’s management to generate income — especially as Japan‘s post-war constitution stipulates that as part of the separation of religion and state the so-called religious corporations that own Shinto shrines cannot receive funds directly from the government
Shinji says that today rental and lease income from the baseball stadium the cafes along the Gingko Avenue and the Meiji Memorial Hall an events venue generate roughly of the organization’s revenue
He added that private funding is essential as closing the baseball stadium — even temporarily — for renovations will severely hamper shrine leaders’ ability to raise the funds needed to maintain operations and the Eternal Forest
In an email to CNN the Tokyo Metropolitan Government said the developers had stated their commitment to protecting and conserving Meiji Jingu’s inner and outer areas gardens while undertaking the necessary renovations and improvements to make them more accessible for future generations
Mitsui Fudosan meanwhile said via email that it planned to handle each tree with care and preserve and transplant as many as possible

During a recent press conference in Tokyo lawmaker Hajime Funada of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party said that because the Meiji Jingu does not publicly disclose its finances the corporation gives the impression it is trying to preserve the inner garden by using the outer garden to earn money
The Meiji Jingu Stadium which is still used as the home of professional baseball team the Yakult Swallows is something of an icon among sports fans — and has even featured in several manga and anime series
According to Kiyotatsu Yamamoto an associate professor in landscape planning and tourism at the University of Tokyo opposition to the redevelopment has been fueled by authorities’ lack of clarity over the park’s value as a cultural asset
He pointed to recent controversy over the neighboring Japan National Stadium which was built for the Tokyo Summer Olympics
Although heralded in some quarters for eschewing carbon-intensive concrete the project was constructed using timber from around felled trees and is estimated to have cost around billion yen billion
Rochelle Kopp a Tokyo-based management consultant who organized the aforementioned petition said that the public is fed up seeing trees sacrificed for large building projects
She also argued that city officials used the Olympic stadium as a pretext to remove building height restrictions that once applied to Jingu Gaien
This she wrote in her petition plea paved the way for the approval of skyscrapers on the proposed site
ICOMOS director Mikiko Ishikawa likened the plan to building skyscrapers in New York’s Central Park and a stadium next to its avenue of American Elms
She fears that plans to build the new baseball stadium’s foundations at a depth of meters feet just meters feet away from one side of the Ginkgo Avenue will interfere with the trees’ roots and block their access to sunlight and water

The national government local authorities developers and citizens should all sit down together at one table and think about what we should do to protect this important park said Ishikawa
Tokyo’s government has designated more than of the city as protected areas which include conservation zones and green spaces that help promote biodiversity
However according to data published by the World Cities Culture Forum parks and gardens occupy just of Tokyo’s land compared to in New York and in London
Campaigners argue that more legal protections are needed to conserve scarce greenery in the Japanese capital
Last week Kopp filed another petition — this time calling for the city to renovate the two stadiums instead of razing and rebuilding them
Both she and ICOMOS director Ishikawa have urged authorities to designate the Gingko Avenue as a place of scenic beauty under Japan’s Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties
The developers have previously promised to replant more trees than they fell but architect and campaigner Nishikawa questioned the value of replacing decades-old trees with new saplings
Studies have shown that large old trees are disproportionately better at absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than younger ones She argued that as the world confronts the climate crisis Japan must place more value on urban conservation
It seems logical to redevelop an area if a factory there has shut down and can no longer be used but Jingu Gaien has acquired cultural value over its -year history — so why does that heritage need to be tampered with she asked
Nishikawa pointed to Kobe’s Koshien Stadium which was built in and painstakingly renovated over the last years as an example of how historic structures can be updated rather than torn down
Yamamoto the national parks expert said restoring rather than razing and rebuilding public facilities can shift how people perceive architecture in Japan
Greater emphasis on renovation he added could help challenge the practice of designing buildings with finite lifespans — an approach to construction known in Japan as scrap and build
Campaigners meanwhile argue that a lack of public consultation on the park’s future has deepened mistrust in developers and authorities fueling concern about other green spaces in Japan
Developers will never capture the hearts and minds of the public with this current plan Kopp told CNN
They need to go back to the drawing board and use a much more democratic process to decide the future of Jingu Gaien
