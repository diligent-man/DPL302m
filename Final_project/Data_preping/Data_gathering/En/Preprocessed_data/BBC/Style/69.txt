a bronze age arrowhead unearthed in switzerland was made from a meteorite a new study has found
dating back to between and bc the millimeter long inch long arrowhead was found on a pile dwelling site in m rigen on lake biel switzerland during excavations in the th century according to the study conducted by a team of researchers at the natural history museum of bern
the nearly year old artifact was created with iron from a meteorite that landed in estonia the study noted
this indicates that meteoritic iron was traded in europe by bc or earlier the researchers said adding how unusual it is to find meteoritic iron used so early in history
such evidence of an early use of meteoritic iron is extremely rare according to a news release on the discovery
at the time humans had not yet started to smelt iron from oxide ores but some metallic iron could be found in the impact fields of meteorites according to the study
while objects made using meteoritic iron have been found in turkey greece syria iraq lebanon egypt iran russia and china such artifacts have previously only been discovered at two sites in central and western europe both in poland
now with the arrowhead finding researchers have confirmed m rigen as a third
experts previously thought the iron used in the arrowhead came from the twannberg meteorite which fell to earth just a few kilometers from the pile dwelling
however analysis of the iron showed that this was not the case nor was the material from a meteorite that fell in poland according to the study

there are only three known meteorites with a similar chemical composition in europe but researchers say that the most likely source was one in kaalijarv estonia as the meteorite hit around bc and produced many small fragments according to the study
some of these fragments would later have moved southwest to switzerland along trade routes lead study author beda hofmann head of the earth sciences department at the natural history museum of bern told cnn
an elite bronze age man had brain surgery more than years ago
trade across europe during the bronze age is a well established fact amber from the baltic like the arrowhead presumably tin from cornwall glass beads from egypt and mesopotamia she said via email
it probably just took a bit longer than today and the masses were a few tons and not millions of tons hofmann added
while most people in the bronze age pile dwelling villages in the swiss lakes would have devoted their time to agriculture hunting and fishing there is evidence including molds for casting bronze found at m rigen that some people had developed specialized skills she said
the study was published in the journal of archaeological science
