Editor s Note In Snap we look at the power of a single photograph chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made
A group of men lie at the foot of a sofa their naked bodies peeking out through a carpet of rose petals Some look toward the photograph s protagonist an Asian woman in a lime green dress laying across the cushioned loveseat Others gaze away seemingly indifferent as if caught in some sort of hazy spell
Despite Chinese photographer Yushi Li s gentle staging her title for the photograph The Smothering Dream suggests something more sinister is at play Referencing Dutch painter Lawrence Alma Tadema s work The Roses of Heliogabalus in which a Roman emperor watches on as unsuspecting banquet guests slowly suffocate in flowers Li s modern take shot on a set awash with pastel colors and delicate furniture is equally deceptive at first glance
Li is not only the photographer but also the muse at the center of the image I made this very pink and kitsch dream she said describing the London living room set in a phone interview But underneath it there is like some kind of violence It s a fantasy of love and eroticism smothering these men I desire
Shot in The Smothering Dream was recently on show at Photofairs Shanghai as part of a group exhibition called A Quiet Gaze It was a fitting title to showcase the work of an artist for whom an examination of the male and female gazes has been a recurring theme
Li s wider portfolio of subversive images include softly lit nude portraits of strangers she scouted through a dating app a series titled My Tinder Boys Stripped of their clothes and therefore their character she said the men lounge around their homes doing banal tasks one scoops out of a fresh watermelon while another casually balances a plate of spaghetti over his private parts
The series is partly a response to erotic images objectifying women that are historically ubiquitous in art advertisements and photography Although a canon of male nudes does exist it largely comprises images shot by gay male photographers When Li began the series in she noticed a lack of images depicting naked men as objects of desire from a woman s perspective
After some mistook her work as being shot by a male photographer she began inserting herself into the photos fully clothed alongside naked counterparts and often the only person looking directly at the camera
Photo of a man posing with a Coca Cola bottle in symbolized a cultural shift in China
Instead of being a passive looked at thing I want to be the one who is in control who is creating the story who is expressing my fantasy said Li
Her images have also pushed back against the longstanding fetishization of Asian women often by Western men something Li said she has experienced first hand I m a small person and come across as quiet so I kind of fit the stereotype Li who was born in China s Hunan province and now lives in the UK
She said she feels flattered when women reach out to her online to say they feel empowered by her photographs As a woman especially as an Asian or Chinese woman you should be able to feel that you can also express your erotic desire
Li has been fascinated with how the idea of the gaze has today become less binary She has also been examining and playing with the way classical paintings depict power dynamics portrayals of desire and representations of the body
She brings these ideas into Paintings Dreams and Love an ongoing project to which The Smothering Dream belongs A second photo from the same shoot entitled After the Dream hints at what has just taken place with satin cushions and wilted petals strewn about the scene
Other sources of inspiration include Swiss painter Henry Fuseli s The Nightmare showing an incubus crouching menacingly atop a sleeping woman and The Death of Actaeon Renaissance painter Titian s th century oil painting of the Romans goddess of the hunt Diana transforming the Theban hero into a stag that is then killed by his own hounds
In Li s reinterpretations she is in full control In the former she wears a tight red turtleneck as she casually sits on an unsuspecting male figure thwarting the idea of seduction In the latter she strikes a calm calculated pose pointing a bow and arrow at a naked man in a window
This photographer s surreal images explore the complexity of Asian American identity
But control Li says is subjective in images where multiple gazes can co exist Some of these men in the photographs also look at me and the viewer also looks at all of us she said The internet age she added has only further complicated matters Now you can look at so many things like instantly everywhere or wherever whenever you want it s something very different it s not just a physical thing it s a digital thing
There s also the gaze from the algorithm and the gaze from the screen that reflects yourself when you look at it the internet means we re subjected to the gaze more in a way
