When Eve Arnold joined Magnum in four years after the renowned photographic agency was founded she was its first female photographer
Magnum was about to open a New York office she would write in her acclaimed monograph ’s ‘The Unretouched Woman’
I was to be their token American woman stringer By when she became a full member she was one of just two women on the agency’s books internationally
Seventy years later a new exhibition delves into Eve Arnold’s extensive archive foregrounding a collection of her most significant work
The subject matter is definitely not just women but it is her perspective that we wanted to reflect said Nicola Jones founder and director of the Newlands House Gallery in Britain in an interview with CNN
The photographer’s most celebrated images are presented alongside several of her lesser known but equally compelling works from Marilyn Monroe on the set of The Misfits to Malcolm X speaking in Washington and Black fashion shows in Harlem to a natal ward in Long Island

One thing that comes through in all of her photographs is a non-judgmental empathetic character continued Jones
The breadth of her work too was so extraordinary as was how quietly and effectively she overcame various taboos and similarly the access she managed to obtain
Born in Philadelphia to Jewish immigrant parents from Ukraine aged Eve moved to New York where she married eventually settling in the UK in the s where she lived until her death at age in
While in New York she took a photography class under Alexey Brodovitch — the-then art director of Harper’s Bazaar — at the New School for Social Research
Tasked with a fashion assignment Eve spent a year photographing weekly catwalk shows in Harlem a largely invisible within the mainstream fashion industry series of events featuring Black models showing off homemade outfits to a Black crowd
The photos were fantastic and really ground-breaking said Jones
She chose to do something so incredibly different at a time when segregation was still so prevalent in America

The issues she photographed are as important now if not more so than ever before Michael Arnold the photographer’s grandson told CNN in an interview
She kept herself neutral because she saw her job as a reporter
She was fascinated in what was going on in the world around her and wanted to shine a light on it
Despite being apolitical her subjects revealed her interests

The original piece interestingly was called ‘Women Without Men’ — as if that’s such a groundbreaking thing — but in it was something you could make a reportage story out of said Michael
When Eve started out doing photography of women were housewives
For her to go out and be traveling the world was groundbreaking
Indeed she acknowledged the anomaly and supposed eccentricity of her gender in The Unretouched Woman
My colleagues were not spoken of in inverted commas they were not ‘career men’ or ‘men photographers’ she wrote recognizing the double standard while never establishing herself as a feminist
Her gender however while in no way shaping her photographic successes would by default inform her legacy at the vanguard of twentieth century photography something she frequently downplayed said Michael
It wasn’t false modesty she genuinely found it quite strange he recalled
She perhaps didn’t even recognize the role that she played in the history of photography
While Eve once told Michael she didn’t want to be known just for her Marilyn Monroe work the images are a striking example of her broader practice and ability to build authentic relationships with her subjects
Those shots globally known now tell a story of a lady who managed to gain the trust of someone who was notoriously vulnerable and at times fragile who trusted Eve to photograph her in ways that perhaps she wouldn’t allow others to said Jones
Moreover what allowed Eve ultimately to produce work as she did was her bold sense of curiosity
That drove her a genuine insatiable kind of curiosity
She wanted to know what made someone tick said Michael
I think her compassion and curiosity is one of the major things that sets her apart
It’s the kind of humanity that shines through whether she’s photographing the royal family or a working-class family
That’s what makes her photography relatable and timeless
Eve Arnold — To Know About Women is on at the Newlands House Gallery in Petworth UK until January
