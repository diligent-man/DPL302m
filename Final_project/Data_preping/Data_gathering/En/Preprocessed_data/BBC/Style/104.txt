Photographer Felipe Romero Beltr n s depiction of a migrant facility in Spain oozes with the boredom and malaise of life in legal limbo His young subjects are seen smoking cigarettes lifting weights and trimming one another s hair Other images show them hanging out in a grubby yard or lying around on mattresses
The photos were shot with the help of nine young Moroccans whom Beltr n befriended in Seville capital of the southern region of Andaluc a Published in his new book Dialect the pictures were initially intended to be personal not political But they ultimately spoke to what Beltr n called a Kafka esque system in which the men waited for years to learn whether their residency applications would be approved
At the beginning it was just about this group of guys Beltr n said on a video call from Madrid But of course I realized that I was photographing these really specific political bodies or political subjects in this bureaucracy
Last year nearly migrants arrived in Spain by sea down from a record of over in according to UNHCR data Of these most arrived in the Canary Islands or Andaluc a a region separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar a stretch of water just kilometers eight miles at its narrowest
The nine men who didn t previously know one another were among those to arrive by boat during the early months of the Covid pandemic in search of a better life Recounting his journey with an essay in Dialect one of Beltr n s subjects Youssef Elhafidi recalls another terrified teen migrant being forced by smugglers to pilot their boat
He did not want to drive the fear was paralyzing him they took out a knife and put it on his neck threatening him to start the engines Elhafidi wrote The boy started the machine between trembling and crying and we headed north
According to Beltr n his nine subjects were required to stay in Spain for three continuous years before applying for residency Undocumented and without the right to work during this time they were dependent on the state for food and housing
While living at the government run facility the men took Spanish lessons and joined workshops to help them adapt to life in Spain some of which were run by Beltr n
Overcoming an initial language barrier the photographer began working with the group to produce images and videos As well as candid portraits the pictures focus on conditions at the facility from peeling walls to basic food supplies
Many of the images were however staged As Beltr n looked for different ways to engage with his subjects he asked them to re enact moments from their respective migration journeys In one a subject lies motionless on blue gym mats just as he had upon landing on Spain s coast Another shows two of the men carrying a third on their shoulders to recreate the moment he fainted during a day long walk to Seville from a small town to its south
The resulting book is thus part documentary and part performance with Beltr n toeing the line between mentor and collaborator photographer and choreographer More than just an artistic decision staging photos directly responded to the tedium of the migrants abundant free time
There was an activity around taking the images it was something during the day that could get them excited And it was fun Beltr n recalled Everyone was laughing and they just make jokes each other during the sessions

When Beltr n began delivering workshops at the facility in he was all too familiar with the system his subjects were trapped in A few years earlier he had relocated to Spain from his native Colombia and even as a college educated Spanish speaker also struggled to navigate the complex immigration processes
To illustrate the challenge facing his francophone subjects his project included a video titled Recital in which they attempted to read the first four pages of the Spanish immigration law that would determine their futures They weren t understanding a word he recalled noting that although lawyers were assigned to act on the men s behalf the language barrier and dense legalese removed their agency
The opening pages of Dialect whose title alludes to these very linguistical challenges are dedicated to stills from the video Pictures of the men struggling to comprehend the legislation are overlaid with technical terminology Right to effective judicial protection reads the text on one frame another says Authorizations for the purpose of carrying out profit making activities
These legal procedures are really really complicated even for native speakers said Beltr n who is now completing a PhD program in photography in Madrid It becomes almost like translation work translating these laws and bureaucracies into something understandable to normal people like us
The result he said is an inevitable sense of helplessness
You can t talk with anyone Beltr n added You can t ask Who is the law or Who is the state You don t have anyone to approach You don t have any tools to make a living The system is built to avoid you or to deny you access to it
Describing the group as just young people trying to figure out what to do with life the photographer hopes his project can humanize migrants experiences in a world increasingly desensitized to images of their suffering
Since Beltr n completed his project most of his subjects have completed their three year wait and now formally reside in Spain he says He remains in touch with some including Elhafidi who he says works in a restaurant and has accompanied him at promotional events for the book s launch
In the conclusion of his essay Elhafidi recalled how he felt when he secured his residency writing It took me three years of searching and putting courage to life until finally the moment came after being cold scared hungry and the most difficult thing my mother s tears I got it he wrote
Powerful photographs depict years of human migration
I got the papers Now after getting it I have another look at life I finally feel that I have the opportunity to be whoever I want to be
They re building their lives Beltr n said of those including Elhafidi who have secured residency Fortunately they now can go back to Morocco to visit and see their families
