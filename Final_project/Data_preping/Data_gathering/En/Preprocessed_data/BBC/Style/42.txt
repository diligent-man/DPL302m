In Miami a city where most of the coastal metropolis’s skyline shimmers in silver or reflects blue skies and water through glass a fashionable newcomer will be outfitted in black and ivory and topped with an elaborate gold crown
Like the boning on a luxe corset matte black steel beams will form its story structure topping out at feet tall Reaching the maximum allowable height set for the city by the Federal Aviation Admission the skyscraper will tie for the city’s tallest building with other flashy forthcoming projects when it is completed in including the Waldorf Astoria Miami and Foster+Partner designed The Towers
The brand behind the new residential tower and star hotel is familiar too but more for its runway shows and red carpet appearances — the building on Brickell Avenue in Downtown Miami marks DolceGabbana’s first foray into real estate expanding the Italian label’s influence from where you shop to where you sleep
For residents the fashion house’s involvement in their day to day living won’t just be the bones of the one to four bedroom condos and or the building’s luxury amenities but a full curation of everything in each of the homes explained Michael Stern CEO and founder of the developer JDS Development Group in a phone call
We’re selling fully turnkey apartments — we’re completely fitting them out and furnishing them accessorizing down to the bathrobes and books on the bookshelf he explained
The interiors designed by DolceGabbana founders Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana will come in three color palettes white with Bianco Striata Marble black with Nero Marquina Marble and gold with Giallo Imperiale Marble
The residences include very elaborate marbles amazing light fixtures… and an incredibly luxurious palette Stern said There’s a lot of flexibility for people to make good choices
Renderings show lavish details including Venetian chandeliers and freestanding bathtubs in front of sweeping ocean views with materials complementing the dramatic façade of the building designed by Studio Sofield the firm that has also worked on eye catching projects such as New York’s rail thin Steinway Tower
The world’s skinniest skyscraper is now complete — and its interiors are remarkable
Will DolceGabbana’s fashion cachet translate into desirable US real estate The brand is certainly not the only luxury leader making similar plays in Florida with Armani offering a private beach accessible to residents from its skyscraper and automotive brands Bentley and Porsche both owned by Volkswagen Group erecting towers along the state’s coastline too
Drawing upon their established aesthetics and recognizable designer names the number of fashion players opening branded hotels worldwide meanwhile has also spiked in recent years including Bulgari Versace and Roberto Cavalli
In April DolceGabbana formally announced its entry into the sector with additional residential and hospitality projects planned for Marbella Spain and the Maldives respectively The new buildings follow the launch of the furniture homewares and textile line DolceGabbana Casa two years ago which will outfit each of their properties
Alfonso Dolce CEO of the company explained over email that the end goal is to become ambassadors of ‘Made in Italy’ in the world and to expand the perimeter of the company’s activities with a view to an all round lifestyle experience
Stern says the brand recognition from luxury labels sets a standard of hospitality and care
If you go into the DolceGabbana showroom and get tailored for a fine suit or couture the way they treat you from a service perspective… we’re trying to mirror that in our in our residential experience he said I think it’s just helpful for somebody to understand because they’ve got a reference to start with
