British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak got up to speak from a podium bearing the words Long-Term Decisions for a Brighter Future the slogan for this year’s Conservative Party conference But over the past three days on the fringes of the governing party’s annual meeting members have been planning their own long-term future and in some cases for one that doesn’t involve him
This year’s gathering in Manchester a historic city that was formerly the industrial powerhouse of northern England held extra significance as it is likely the last to take place before the next general election
It was a golden opportunity for Sunak to unite his party after the battering his party’s credibility took from his two immediate predecessors the scandal-hit era of Boris Johnson and the economic tumult of Liz Truss
However despite the fact Sunak who has been in office for less than a year has exceeded expectations by steadying the ship and restoring some calm to British politics many members of his own party members spent this week settling old scores and resigning themselves to defeat
Britain makes drastic cuts to giant HS rail project
As one senior Conservative told CNN on the night before Sunak’s keynote speech He has done the near impossible and given us some hope of staying in power
For some reason they don’t seem to want to let him
Sunak is seeking a historic fifth successive term for the Conservative Party which has been in power since first in coalition and from alone
Those years have been some of the most consequential in modern British politics
From Brexit to the Covid- pandemic Johnson’s transgressions and Truss’s turmoil Sunak inherited an unpopular mess of a party that according to opinion polls looks doomed
Nevertheless Sunak and his team are optimistic that they can pull the party together before the next election which must take place by January
And their strategy for achieving this aim appears to involve shifting further to the right with policies and rhetoric that are tailor-made for Conservative members rather than the broader public
One of the clearest signs this week that Sunak feels the need to appeal to the right-wing of his base was the presence at the conference of Nigel Farage one of Britain’s most famous Brexiteers and perma-scourge of the Conservatives
It was Farage as then-leader of the Euroskeptic UK Independence Party who drove the political narrative that eventually forced the Conservatives to hold a referendum on leaving the European Union in
While the party establishment loathes Farage Conservative members greeted him with open arms and requests for selfies after he arrived on Monday afternoon
In many ways he was the star of the show here in Manchester
It’s instructive then to see Sunak’s strategy through that lens
Last week the PM announced a controversial U-turn on green policies including a delay on a plan to boost the number of electric cars on Britain’s roads He has criticized the opposition Labour Party for endorsing lower speed limits for drivers
Many of his Cabinet ministers have hinted at the prospect of leaving the European Convention on Human Rights which they regard as hindering efforts to curb immigration to the UK particularly by refugees
The health minister said transgender patients could be banned from hospital wards that corresponded to their lived gender Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch railed against trans rights activists repeating an attack line that Labour MPs don’t know what a woman is
Sunak delays crucial UK climate targets with one eye on the next election
And in his closing speech Sunak scrapped an expensive high-speed rail project in the north of England which he claimed would save taxpayers £ billion which he said would be reinvested instead in hundreds of new transport projects in the North and Midlands both rail and road
The optics of this were curious as the scrapped project known as HS would have provided Manchester the conference’s host city with faster links to London and the wider region with better rail capacity and connections
Asked if they believed making the announcement in Manchester was a PR own goal a Sunak ally told CNN The brutal truth is we are not going to win in Manchester anyway so it doesn’t matter if we piss them off
Most of this is broadly attractive to Conservative members and it would be reasonable to assume that it would give them a reason to rally behind Sunak
But there was not much sign of unity this week
The Conservative Party has always been a broad church with competing factions jostling for supremacy
But these factions appear more splintered than ever
Walking around the conference centre it was striking to see groups of Conservatives who in various ways represented every iteration of the party since
And quite a lot of those factions sincerely dislike one another and have serious disdain for each other’s vision for the future of the party
The most high-profile rebellion came from Sunak’s immediate predecessor Truss who spoke at a rally at the same time as Jeremy Hunt Sunak’s finance minister gave his conference speech on the main stage
Truss along with others on the libertarian right called for a complete rethink of the tax system and size of the state Her speech was made almost a year to the day that her own tax-cutting plans caused markets to crash and sank the pound to its worst low ever against the dollar
You might assume that less than months since her disastrous premiership came to an end the public might not be that interested in Truss’s thoughts
But Conservative Party members are rather different to the general public
In stark contrast to Hunt’s speech taking place on the main stage Truss’s rally held in a side room of a hotel next to the main conference center was standing-room only
But other factions within the party believe the true Conservative talisman to be another former PM Boris Johnson
Superficially the Johnsonites are on the same wing of the party as Truss and her acolytes
However the most passionate of his supporters are the so-called red wall voters People typically from the north of England from poorer backgrounds who supported Brexit and in many cases voted Conservative for the first time because of Johnson
The red-wall name is derived from the color most associated with the opposition Labour Party which historically held sway in these areas
Many members of this group find Truss’s talk of tax cuts for the wealthy and businesses offensive and out-of-touch at a time the UK is suffering a cost-of-living crisis
A senior member of a local government in one of these areas told CNN How could anyone expect me to go and tell people that we should cut taxes and cut money for local government It’s ridiculous
Unfortunately for Sunak many of these members didn’t have a much better view of him
While broadly they supported lots of his recent announcements they simply don’t believe he is serious about them
He won’t do it properly said one of the red-wall members
On the opposite wing of the party the moderates are uncomfortable with some of the rhetoric they are hearing from cabinet ministers and the prime minister on issues like migration and LGBT+ rights especially Suella Braverman the home secretary whose hardline stance worries even some on the right of the Conservative Party including within the cabinet
The most optimistic group of Conservatives currently are those within Sunak’s orbit
This group sincerely believes that despite the polls Sunak stands a very decent chance of remaining prime minister after the next election
There is some merit to this view since Sunak’s green U-turn he has seen an improvement in his poll numbers and his personal approval ratings are better than those of anyone else in his party according to the pollster YouGov
Many highly respected political operatives have returned to the party to work on the election campaign and as one of them told CNN I wouldn’t have given up my well-paid job if I thought we were going to lose
The frustration for Sunak’s allies is that despite their optimism so many of the party’s other factions have already decided that the next election is lost and are digging into their respective trenches before the post-election blame game starts
A government source told CNN It will be a tragedy if we lose because these people for whatever reason cannot get over themselves and get behind Rishi
We really can win this thing but we need them to come with us
Adding to the sense of inevitable loss was the open and obvious debate about the future of the party beyond Sunak
Events like the one Truss attended were in the eyes of many members the starting gun for a battle over the party’s soul once in opposition
Indeed many of the frontrunners to succeed Sunak should he lose including members of his own cabinet spoke at an unusually high number of cosy in-conversation style events with friendly hosts playing for the applause of party members in the audience
Despite all of this Sunak could reasonably call this year’s conference a success if you compare it to other conferences in recent years
He has improved the party’s prospects since taking office and there wasn’t the same sense of doom that lingered over last year’s meeting
It’s more that this is a party that feels tired confused and is at times acting desperately with its hotchpotch of red-meat policies and populist rhetoric
It might not be fair and it might not even be accurate but the general sense of deflation was more potent than that of optimism
