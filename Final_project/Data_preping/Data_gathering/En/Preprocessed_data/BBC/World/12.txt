at least four civilians were killed while in the custody of hamas just feet from where armed militants had been escorting them near the gaza border videos obtained and geolocated by cnn show
one video from the kibbutz of be eri in southern israel showed armed fighters with burned cars and a bulldozer in the background
toward the end of the video which was released on a hamas affiliated telegram channel four bodies can be seen on the ground
another video previously geolocated by cnn showed five israeli civilians taken captive by armed militants in nearly the same spot
a cnn analysis of the videos determined that the bodies and the individuals being escorted by heavily armed militants had matching clothes and hairstyles
it is not clear what happened to the fifth hostage
be eri lies just three miles from the eastern border of gaza
alongside other towns and settlements close to gaza such as ofakim sderot yad mordechai kfar aza yated and kissufim it was among the first to be targeted by hamas fighters as they launched saturday morning s unprecedented and carefully coordinated killing and hostage taking spree
the community of be eri was very badly hit israel defense forces idf spokesperson lt
richard hecht said monday during a briefing more than hours after hamas launched the surprise attack
hecht said most hamas militants in be eri had been killed but israeli troops were still there attempting to clear the area of any remaining fighters
we are still fighting
we thought this morning we would be in a better place hecht said
as many as hamas fighters breached the border from gaza according to israeli authorities in an attack that has killed more than israelis prompting retaliatory israeli airstrikes and a formal declaration of war on sunday
more than palestinians have been killed including children according to the health ministry in gaza and medical care has been complicated by israel cutting power to the territory
hamas militants have taken more than israelis hostage including high ranking army officers a spokesperson for the group claimed sunday
it s believed they are in gaza but their fate is unknown
another palestinian armed group islamic jihad on sunday said it is holding at least hostages in gaza
cnn is unable to verify the claims
israel authorities have said that dozens of israelis are being held hostage in gaza but have not confirmed exact numbers
in addition to israeli captives several other nationalities are believed to have been taken hostage
hecht said it was possible that hamas fighters were still crossing into israel from gaza adding that four fighting divisions had been deployed in the south
he said around breach points had been totally secured but other points were more vulnerable
there are some areas where we are still holding on with tanks and air cover
i can t deny the fact that there are still people coming in it s an ongoing fight he said
