when jeison aristiz bal became the cnn hero of the year in the first from latin america he shared a powerful message for young people with disabilities and their families
i want to tell you that yes you can
you can dream and you can achieve your dreams he said
growing up with cerebral palsy in one of the poorest areas of cali colombia aristiz bal pushed himself to defy society s expectations
he has dedicated his life to bringing therapy education and support to other young people with disabilities in his community so they can realize their potential
since his organization asodisvalle has expanded in big ways opening even more doors of opportunity for those he helps
with his prize money and donations aristiz bal and his organization purchased the land where they built a much larger rehabilitation center equipped with new technology and more medical tools for all the children s needs
they ve grown from helping some young people to more than today he said
along with specialized therapies his center provides students with free education and a host of programs including dance sports and music
older students can also learn job skills
not only has aristiz bal expanded his nonprofit he was inspired to become a lawyer and graduated from law school three years ago
i realized that the world needs more people to defend the rights of those with disabilities he said
my goal is to help change the laws of this country so that those with disabilities will have more opportunities
this year he and his foundation realized yet another big dream building a university
inspired by a group of older students from the program the organization began construction two years ago
today we have the first university for young people with disabilities in latin america he said
now in its first year with students enrolled the university offers a range of classes including computer programming d technology graphic design and languages
students can also learn skills in culinary arts carpentry music and tailoring
it has all the equipment so that people with disabilities can study in an accessible way aristiz bal said
we have ocular technology for example
those who can t move their hands or feet are operating computers with their eyes
aristiz bal says the focus is not only to help students attain their college education but to prepare them for employment so they can join the workforce become providers in their families and contribute to a variety of fields
the foundation is changing the concept of the word disability understanding that they can that they re capable he said
the young people who inspired the idea for the university aristiz bal says started out learning to be bakers at the foundation
now they are employed at a local food production plant
before their families saw them as though they were not going to be able to do much he said
today they have a job they have a salary
they re the ones who put food on the table
ultimately aristiz bal wants to show the world what anybody can achieve if given the chance
jeison is a role model for us said ayleen who started at the foundation when she was and plans to enroll at the university next year to become a teacher
he s shown us that there is no limitation no disability no nothing stopping us from achieving our dreams
