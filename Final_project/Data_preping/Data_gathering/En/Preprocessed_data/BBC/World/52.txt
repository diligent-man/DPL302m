a drag queen who dressed as jesus christ and performed a rock rendition of the lord s prayer has been arrested in the philippines under the country s obscenity laws sparking a fierce debate about free speech and protections for members of the lgbtq community
the philippines is a deeply christian country and the catholic church maintains significant influence both in daily life and politics
amadeus fernando pagente whose drag name is pura luka vega and who uses the pronoun they them was widely accused of blasphemy by officials with the catholic church and others after videos of their performance singing ama namin the tagalog version of the prayer went viral in july
the performer was taken into police custody on wednesday under a law that prohibits immoral doctrines obscene publications and exhibitions and indecent shows by offending any religion according to a statement from their legal team on x formerly twitter
the allegations say they also violated a cybercrime law because the video was shared online to allegedly perpetrate the stated crime
the legal team vowed to contest the charges and focus initially on securing pagente s bail
online videos of the drag artist belting out the tagalog version of the lord s prayer alongside revellers in a bar sparked a significant backlash from religious organizations
the show in which pagente could be seen dressed in robes imitating catholic vestments with a golden halo provoked a furor and became headline news for weeks in the philippines while more than a dozen cities including the capital manila where the performer resides declared pagente persona non grata a symbolic move declaring them no longer welcome
pagente s arrest came after a criminal complaint was filed in august by the hijos del nazareno central a group representing devotees of the black nazarene a dark wood sculpture of jesus brought to the philippines in from mexico and considered miraculous by its devotees
the group famously organizes a huge annual religious parade in quezon city which draws hundreds of thousands of devotees
in a facebook post after pagente s arrest hijos del nazareno central said its devotees will not allow the defamation of the name of the lord jesus of the nazarene cnn has reached out to the group for further comment
multiple politicians including senators also went on philippine television shows to criticize the drag artist s performance calling it blasphemous disrespectful and offensive
the drag artist has previously apologized to those who felt uncomfortable about their performance
but they also defended the act as a form of art telling cnn affiliate cnn philippines in an interview that the performance was an expression of the feeling of exclusion as a queer person in a deeply catholic country
i understand that people call my performance blasphemous offensive or regrettable
however they shouldn t tell me how i practice my faith or how i do my drag
that performance was not for you to begin with
it is my experience and my expression of having been denied my rights the performer wrote in a post on july on x
father jerome secillano spokesman of the catholic bishops conference of the philippines told cnn on thursday that the performance was deemed offensive by the church for what it viewed as a lack of reverence
the performance was a mockery of our faith and elements of our faith should not be used for secular purposes especially for entertainment he said
but secillano stopped short of commenting whether the church viewed pagente s arrest as the right thing to do to defend the faith
nearly of filipinos identify as roman catholic and the church still wields a great deal of power and influence
the philippines is the only country in the world aside from vatican city where divorce is still not allowed
same sex marriage and abortion are also banned
an anti discrimination bill that would do more to protect minorities has also made little headway in congress in recent years against opposition from conservatives
human rights watch senior researcher carlos conde described pagente s arrest as an outrage and an overreaction on the part of those who felt offended
this case is pushed by a few people that pura luka vega supposedly offended not by filipinos at large who decided to weaponize existing laws against lgbt people conde told cnn in an emailed statement
pagente was a contestant on the reality pageantry show drag den which launched in december on amazon prime
the series directed by rod singh a transgender filipino was set in an underground den juxtaposing the drag queens flamboyant personalities with the constant need to remain subversive amidst socially conservative philippine norms
following the arrest singh has defended pagente whom she describes as a friend and colleague saying on x that this issue is no longer about a drag performance your supposed god or your thin faith
whether you admit it or not your prejudice against our community and the rights we demand is at the center of it
with your eyes wide open you believe and worship a god you can t see but close your eyes to the matters of life and human rights that are at stake
you learned to pray but you didn t learn to understand
don t ask us for something you can t give singh added
