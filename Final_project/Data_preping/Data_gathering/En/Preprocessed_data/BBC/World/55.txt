many afghans fled the soviet invasion of their country in settling in pakistan during the biggest refugee crisis in the world at the time
another wave took place in after the taliban retook kabul with thousands of afghans crossing the pakistan border often with incomplete paperwork while waiting for visas to third countries such as the united states
many afghans living in fear of persecution by the taliban have fled to pakistan where they have been subjected to waves of arbitrary detentions arrests and the threat of deportation nonprofit organization amnesty international said in a statement monday

now is not the time to stop it said
