London’s Metropolitan Police posted on social media that local officers were quickly on the scene and arrested five people
Just Stop Oil said the protesters locked themselves to the set using flexible bicycle locks at around pm local time which theater technicians were unable to remove The performance was halted and the theater was evacuated by pm
In a video Just Stop Oil posted to X formerly known as Twitter the audience can be heard booing at the protesters and telling them to get off the stage
Like the citizens of Paris in you have locked your doors while the young face slaughter on the streets We will inherit a scorched earth unfit to live in and our politicians will be long gone Just Stop Oil said We cannot let this stand The show cannot go on
