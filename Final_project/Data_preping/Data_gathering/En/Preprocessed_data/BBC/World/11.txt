International aid groups in Afghanistan are scrambling to send help to survivors of this weekend s earthquake in the west of the country which left more than people dead and many more injured in a war ravaged nation already stricken by an economic crisis
The magnitude earthquake struck on Saturday miles kilometers west of Herat city in the western Herat province the third largest in Afghanistan It was one of the deadliest quakes to hit Afghanistan in years
Images showed massive heaps of debris and rubble after buildings collapsed Crowds of survivors were also seen gathered in the streets for safety
The situation is worse than we imagined with people in devastated villages still desperately trying to rescue survivors from under the rubble with their bare hands said Thamindri de Silva national director at World Vision Afghanistan
Reinforcements from the capital Kabul had arrived to help de Silva added but there was only one hospital and it was at full stretch with serious cases being transferred to other private facilities in the city
Our colleagues and their families are processing this devastation in their hometowns and yet we are responding with everything we have de Silva said People need urgent medical care water food shelter and help to stay safe
Mark Calder World Vision Afghanistan s advocacy lead told CNN that the earthquakes were yet another devastating episode after decades of conflict successive droughts and a collapsed economy
Funding from the international community he added has been inadequate
Organizations like ours are able to provide relief and help recovery but without commitment from international governments and donors more will fall into humanitarian need displacement will increase and lives will be lost The world must not look away now
UN agencies and partners are continuing to mount emergency operations and deploying more teams to join ongoing humanitarian efforts spokesperson for the UN Secretary General St phane Dujarric said
We are coordinating with the de facto authorities to swiftly assess needs and provide emergency assistance Dujarric said
UN Secretary General Ant nio Guterres on Sunday expressed solidarity and called on the international community to come together and support Afghans impacted by the earthquake many of whom were already in need before this crisis he added
UNICEF the UN s children s fund has dispatched hygiene kits family kits sets of winter clothes and blankets tarpaulins and basic household items to ongoing humanitarian efforts
Teams are also conducting additional assessments on the ground and are providing emergency drugs and tents for overburdened health clinics
We will make every effort to bring quick relief to those affected said Fran Equiza its representative in Afghanistan
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on Sunday put the number killed at people with more people hurt and houses completely or partially destroyed But there are fears the toll could rise further
Afghanistan has long been one of Asia s poorest countries and has been ravaged by conflict for decades
The Taliban seized power in August years after their ouster by US troops an event that saw many major aid groups and NGOs pull out and crucial aid programs halted
The Taliban s takeover further isolated Afghanistan from the rest of the world and led to Washington and allies cutting off international funding crippling an economy already heavily dependent on aid
The country continues to suffer significant damage from regular earthquakes
A magnitude earthquake last June in the eastern Paktika and Khost provinces bordering Pakistan killed more than a thousand people
More than people killed as earthquake strikes western Afghanistan
Last week the World Bank warned that two thirds of Afghan families currently faced significant challenges in maintaining their livelihoods making it harder for Afghans to recover from earthquakes which have been regularly occuring in the country
International aid groups have said their ability to respond to calls during major disasters was heavily hampered by the Taliban s takeover and called for more urgent global aid but only a handful of countries have publicly offered support
Neighboring China in a statement issued on Sunday by its foreign ministry said that it would do its best to assist in Afghanistan s disaster relief efforts in light of its needs
