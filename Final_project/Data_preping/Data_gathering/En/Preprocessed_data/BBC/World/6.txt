She was going to her car and they had military people standing by the cars and were shooting so people couldn t reach their cars even to go away And that s when they took her Ricarda told CNN adding that she hopes to see her daughter again but the situation is bleak
It looks very bad but I still have hope I hope that they don t take bodies for negotiations I hope that she s still alive somewhere We don t have anything else to hope for so I try to believe she said
