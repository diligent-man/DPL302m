it s very difficult when you see someone that is so close to you and you know so much being treated like this amir moadi a roommate of noa argamani told cnn adding that he knew about five or six people who had been at the festival and have since gone missing
in another video authenticated by cnn an unconscious woman who was at the festival could be seen being displayed by armed militants in gaza as onlookers shouted allahu akbar
