formula one is no stranger to engineering excellence
it is the pinnacle of motorsport a place where otherworldly machinery is pushed to its very limit
we should no longer be surprised by what humanity and technology working in tandem can achieve
however red bull racing s competitor the rb has absolutely fried the system and blown past the boundaries of what appeared possible in this sport
the word dominance can now be defined by a picture of max verstappen standing victorious atop his race winning machine
many f fans probably know the dutch and austrian anthems by heart by now considering how frequently they have been played post race this season
max verstappen crowned formula one world champion
the rb is probably the best formula one car that s ever been created which is a pretty impressive feat considering we ve seen some special projects over the last few decades f correspondent and presenter lawrence barretto told cnn sport
it s almost a complete car
it is that ideal combination of a great power unit and a great aerodynamic package
it s not just the ridiculous lap times and vast winning margins that make this car exceptional the ubiquitous sense of knowing exactly how a race weekend is going to go is not seen too often in this sport
it is not just the consistency of performance but the consistency of how well it works across such a wide range of conditions corner speed profiles and tracks f journalist edd straw said to cnn sport
it s a car that just works pretty much everywhere
red bull s current driver lineup consists of the all conquering verstappen and year f veteran sergio p rez
the pair sit first and second in the driver standings with verstappen winning his third world title on saturday and wrapped up the constructors championship at suzuka with six races to spare
a red bull driver has seen the checkered flag first at out of the races this season ferrari s carlos sainz was on the top step of the podium at the singapore grand prix with verstappen winning alone
he also won races in a row from miami in may to monza in september breaking sebastian vettel s record of nine consecutive victories and could clinch a third world title this weekend in qatar
the team also has fastest laps to its name and has won three sprint races so far with verstappen second in the sprint race at the qatar grand prix
red bull has somehow built upon its car the rb which won out of races
verstappen was in a record breaking mood that year as well taking victories in a single season eclipsing vettel and michael schumacher s
the rb has subsequently been compared to some of the all time greats in the sport with straw putting it in the same ballpark as ferrari s f mercedes w and mclaren s mp which won out of races
this red bull car has been so dominant in fact that it has sparked a debate around how much time teams should be allowed to spend developing their next car seven time world champion lewis hamilton suggested that teams should be forced to wait until the summer break to start working on next season s offering
i think the fia should probably put a time when everyone is allowed to start developing on the next year s car he told sky sports earlier this year
so august that s when everybody can start so then no one can get an advantage on the next year cause that sucks
if everyone had a cut off time then no one has a head start and it s a real race in that short space of time for the future car
maybe that would help everyone be more on a level the following year
verstappen unsurprisingly was not impressed
we weren t talking about that when hamilton was winning his championships right so i don t think we should now he said to sky sports
that s how formula works
when you have a competitive car it s great but at one point of course you also have to look ahead to the next year
while multiple teams had a heavy swing and miss on the new regulations introduced for red bull hit an absolute home run
the aforementioned rb swept the competition and left the austrian manufacturer as the one to beat
however things looked down for the team when it had a million fine and a reduction in allocated wind tunnel testing time levied upon it by the fia the sport s governing body
the penalty came about as a result of breaching the fia s newly introduced cost cap designed to limit spending in almost all areas in order to level the playing field in f
however just when it seemed as though the bulls might be reined in they stretched their legs
when red bull attacked the new regulations they just did a better job than everyone else said barretto
the technical team is just a very special group of brains and they just saw things that the other teams simply didn t and they were able to put together a package that makes the most of the key part of the regulations which is the floor
they were able to create a floor that runs very very low and flat up against the track and that just means that they get a huge amount of downforce considerably more than any of their rivals
the team s ability to take to the new regulations like ducks to water bulls to tarmac is down in no small part to the continued technical wizardry of chief technical officer adrian newey
newey has been designing f cars since and has won constructors championships split between his time at williams mclaren and red bull
he also helped seven different drivers to titles
red bull team principal christian horner has described newey as the only bloke that can see air in an interview with red bull
straw calls newey central to the entire operation saying that he offers a single minded vision when it comes to designing these machines and credits him with setting the modern aerodynamic template for modern f cars
red bull s machine may be a feat of engineering genius but it takes an elite level driver to really extract the most out of any f car
the fearsome blend of verstappen and the rb is one of the most potent driver car combinations the sport has ever seen
we ve seen michael schumacher have such great periods with ferrari we ve seen lewis hamilton have great periods of dominance with mercedes but we haven t seen this kind of dominance within such a short period of time said barretto
what s particularly impressive this year for max is that even if he hasn t always started at the front he s always had the confidence within himself that he can get to the front
and that comes from not only his belief in his own ability but his belief in the quality of the car and the quality of the team
what lewis michael and seb have done better is they ve had it for a long period of time but this is the best single season from one driver
dominance and dynasties in sports always come to an end whatever happens
roger federer s time at the top of tennis ultimately fizzled out
the bill belichick and tom brady years in new england could not last forever
and mercedes eventually ceded its position at the summit of f to red bull in after being in control for much of the turbo hybrid era
whether verstappen and red bull like it or not the rest of the field will catch up to them at some point
the question now with new regulations on the way again in is how long can they keep this up
because the regulations will remain reasonably stable between now and when the new regs arrive in it s difficult to see how red bull won t be the class leader said barretto
next year maybe even as well they will be the ones to beat but that doesn t mean they can t be beaten
the advantage over the field will drop gradually over time
there is always the possibility though that the team does the unthinkable again and pushes on even further
after the australian grand prix in april mercedes driver george russell suggested that rather frighteningly we have not seen the best of red bull yet
for sure they re holding back he told bbc radio live
i think they almost are embarrassed to show their full potential because the faster they seem globally the more the sport is going to try to hold them back somehow
horner was quick to dismiss russell s allegations of what is known as sandbagging the practice of deliberately underperforming to hide your car s true ability
but it does raise the question how far can red bull go
