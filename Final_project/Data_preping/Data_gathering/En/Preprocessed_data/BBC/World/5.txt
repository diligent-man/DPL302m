gaza militants who attacked an all night music festival in southern israel shot and killed revelers at point blank range then looted their belongings new car dashcam video verified by cnn reveals
the video began circulating on social media on sunday and alongside footage of harrowing kidnappings from the same event has been scrutinized by horrified families desperate for news of loved ones missing since a series of coordinated attacks triggered israel s declaration of war on sunday
israeli officials counted at least bodies near the site of the nova festival outside re im where earlier footage showed carefree partygoers from israel and overseas dancing in the desert soon after sunrise on saturday
some survivors are among more than hostages that the militant group hamas claims to be holding in gaza according to friends and family members who have seen them in videos shared on social platforms
the dashcam video verified by cnn gives a glimpse of the terror as militants took over the festival preventing some partygoers from leaving with deadly force
the first clip begins at a m
according to its timecode just under three hours after the first explosions were reported at the nova festival
the video has no audio but a militant is seen yelling then pointing his machine gun at a man taking cover next to the car
it s unclear if the gunman is firing a warning shot or if he s just shot and injured the civilian who is then seen being led away
his fate is unknown
a second individual is seen in the video lying on the ground at the back of another car
the person begins to move and suddenly another militant appears on screen aims at the person fires and walks away
the person on the ground stops moving
another video from the dashcam timestamped at p m shows two militants approach the body of the second individual
they rifle through the person s pockets and one picks something off the body and puts it into his own back pocket
less than three minutes later militants grab a woman out of the back of the car
she is led away and the militants begin to open another car s trunk and empty a suitcase on the ground to be pilfered
the video picks up at p m with the captured woman running back into view
her hands in the air she appears to be waving toward the festival grounds
dirt and dust are seen flying as bullets hit the ground around her
next to the emptied suitcase and open trunk she takes cover again
her fate is unknown
ricarda louk last saw her daughter shani lying face down in the back of a pickup truck heading to the gaza strip an isolated coastal enclave of almost million people crammed into square miles
she last spoke to her after hearing rockets and alarms sounding in southern israel and phoned her daughter to see if she d made it to a secure location
shani told her mother she was at the festival held in an open field with few places to hide
aerial footage posted on social media showed dozens of cars along the side of the road near the entrance to the festival grounds some burned others with windows missing and doors hanging open
shani was trying to reach one of those vehicles her mother said
she was going to her car and they had military people standing by the cars and were shooting so people couldn t reach their cars even to go away
and that s when they took her ricarda told cnn
mother describes seeing video of kidnapped daughter on social media
the disturbing video of her daughter in the back of the pickup truck and attempts by someone to use shani s credit card twice in gaza after the attack are the only hints she has of her daughter s whereabouts
in the video she is seen motionless
one gunman carrying a rocket propelled grenade launcher has his leg draped over her waist and the other holds a clump of her dreadlocks
allahu akbar they cheer meaning god is great in arabic
ricarda hopes she will see her daughter again but the situation is bleak
it looks very bad but i still have hope
i hope that they don t take bodies for negotiations
i hope that she s still alive somewhere
we don t have anything else to hope for so i try to believe she said
like ricarda louk yakov argamani last saw his daughter on one of the cellphone videos that have emerged in the aftermath of saturday s raid
noa argamani is seen pleading for help from the back of a motorcycle driven by hamas militants at the festival site
her tearful father struggled to find words to convey his shock and grief on seeing the video i couldn t believe it i didn t want to believe it yakov told cnn
noa was attending the festival with her boyfriend avinatan or who is also seen being led away by militants
noa s childhood friend shlomit marciano who was helping comfort her family when they spoke to cnn said the text messages they received suggest their friends were hiding for hours as militants rampaged through the festival site
or texted noa s father around a m
to say the couple were safe almost four hours after the first reports of an attack
other friends also texted begging for help marciano said
video shows militants take festival goers hostage
since that no contact
we suppose they were abducted at
they probably were hiding for three four hours begging for help
they started hiding after hearing the massacres and the shooting
and then the militants found them marciano said
now yakov is relying on his faith marciano said
he believes in god
he s praying that she s okay
and she will come back to him to the family and to us safely
she s their only child
