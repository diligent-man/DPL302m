estefan a rebell n knows the trauma that stems from being forced to flee your home for safety
she understands the fear and uncertainty felt by the more than million migrant and forcibly displaced children around the world
she was a migrant child too
my family s case is the case of many refugees and migrants at the border
it was never a choice for our family to leave our home
we were forced out of it rebell n said
she was when her family fled cali colombia because of death threats to her father who had been forced into hiding
they settled in miami and with the support of teachers at school rebell n thrived
now through her nonprofit yes we can world foundation she provides education for children living in limbo in shelters at the us mexico border
rebell n moved from miami to los angeles when she was to pursue an acting career
in she was so moved after volunteering in migrant camps in tijuana that she put her career on hold
there were no schools set up to help these kids
they were walking around the camps barefoot she said
i couldn t forget about what i had just seen
and i was like i literally have to go back
rebell n and her partner kyle schmidt used about of their savings to buy tents and supplies and set up a makeshift school at the border
they enlisted volunteer teachers to provide learning opportunities in the camps
we set up a school overnight and told just a couple of kids rebell n said
it spread throughout the camp and we had like over kids surrounding us
in the months that followed when those families living in the camps were moved to shelters rebell n and schmidt wanted to continue offering educational services
i thought why don t we turn a bus into a mobile classroom and we could take it to all the different shelters rebell n said
we literally just googled and youtubed how to convert a bus into a mobile classroom
over the next year rebell n and schmidt bought and gutted a bus partnered with shelters and drove the transformed bus over the border
their goal to provide bilingual educational programs to keep children in school
all the families that we work with and all the children that we work with on a daily basis are legally seeking asylum rebell n said
they re going through all the processes that are being required of them
rebell n s organization hires professional teachers and tailors their curriculum to the specific needs of each student
the program has been accredited by the education secretary in mexico and serves children ages to a crucial period for education rebell n says
despite the challenges she faced as a migrant child she says she was lucky to have teachers who advocated for her and guided her along the way
many migrant children do not have this support and often fall through the cracks and miss valuable school time
many have been on the road for months if not years and have difficulty attending school because they are often in transit without a permanent home
safety economic instability poverty lack of transportation and perceived legal status are also factors
people don t realize that this is such a long process for families rebell n said
it s not just like you arrive at the border you seek asylum and your life is all rainbows
it takes decades and a lot of work and a lot of pain
rebell n s family navigated a decades long legal process to obtain political asylum and later us citizenship
her parents both lawyers by trade were forced to abandon their careers in colombia and take on new jobs in the us to support their family of five
her mother worked multiple jobs as a caregiver and her father worked nights at walmart
he has worked there full time for nearly years
any time i get a chance i share my immigration story with the kids rebell n said
i always want the kids that come through our programs to realize that being a migrant is not something they need to be ashamed of
today yes we can foundation educates kids a day through its four school locations along the border and three mobile school buses
since rebell n says the group has served more than migrant children from countries
their program runs monday through friday from am to pm
school runs for the entire year with no summer breaks
they also provide free uniforms backpacks and school supplies
lessons focus on common core instruction in the subjects of language arts math and science as well as addressing practical and immediate needs like how to translate basic information including phone numbers and addresses
i want our efforts to be something permanent rebell n said
and that when it s all said and done we will be proud to look back and say that we were there when people needed us the most
