the nobel prize in chemistry has been awarded to a trio of scientists who worked to discover and develop quantum dots used in led lights and tv screens as well as by surgeons when removing cancer tissue
moungi bawendi louis brus and alexei ekimov were lauded as pioneers in the exploration of the nanoworld by the nobel committee for chemistry as it announced the prize in swedish capital stockholm on wednesday
for a long time nobody thought you could ever actually make such small particles
but this year s laureates succeeded said johan aqvist chair of the committee
heiner linke a member of the chemistry committee explained at the announcement ceremony what made the laureates work so revolutionary
the core thing about quantum dots is that just by changing their size you change their properties for example their color
this is completely unusual linke said
nobel peace prize could give a glimmer of hope amid era of conflict and climate crisis
if you imagine for example you want to dye t shirts a red one a green one a yellow one a blue one
for each of these colors you would use a different molecule
different atoms in different constellations give you different colors that s what chemistry is all about he said
but thanks to the scientists work in nanotechnology quantum dots allow us to use precisely the same atoms in the same constellations and just change the size how many of the atoms you have and get new colors and new other properties
bawendi a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology and brus professor emeritus at columbia university are american
ekimov is russian and works for nanocrystals technology inc which is based in new york
france born bawendi got an early morning call from stockholm breaking the news that he is one of the chemistry laureates
he told the news conference he felt very surprised sleepy shocked unexpected and very honored and would celebrate his win by teaching his a m

in the nanoworld matter starts to be measured in millionths of a millimeter
at this level strange phenomena start to occur called quantum effects
quantum dots consist of just a few thousand atoms
in terms of size one quantum dot is to a soccer ball as a soccer ball is to the earth
in the early s this year s chemistry laureates louis brus and alexei ekimov succeeded in creating independently of each other quantum dots which are nanoparticles so tiny that quantum effects determine their characteristics nobelprize pic twitter com qpd ahabex
when light is passed through quantum dots they emit a specific color
this can be finely tuned and is determined by the size of the dots
the bigger dots glow red while the smallest glow green or blue
the slightest of changes in the size of the particle can change its hue right across the spectrum of the color wheel
the laureates work has allowed scientists to capitalize on some of the properties of the nanoworld and quantum dots are now found in living rooms and operating theaters across the world
they are now widely used in tvs and have several advantages over traditional lcd panels creating more vibrant and accurate colors as well as requiring less energy to operate
why quantum dots are taking over your tv
the dots which are manufactured in a powdered form are laid over a plate of diodes that emit blue light at the back of tvs and other screens
the blue light illuminates the quantum dots which emit their own color depending on their size
the dots are also widely used in medical diagnostics
doctors use them to illuminate molecules that can bind themselves to cancer tumors allowing the surgeon to distinguish the healthy tissue from the diseased
the nobel committee explained how the scientists work had helped develop quantum dots
in the s ekimov created size dependent quantum effects in colored glass
a few years later brus became the first scientist to prove size dependent quantum effects in particles floating freely in a liquid
in bawendi then changed the chemical production of quantum dots resulting in what the committee called almost perfect particles this development allowed the dots to be used in applications
judith giordan president of the american chemical society praised the laureates work
here is an enormously important discovery that actually has gone over decades from a theoretical phenomenon to be able to produce it in the lab and then to be able to manufacture it in controlled quantities to allow for that wide range of wavelengths and colors is absolutely phenomenal giordan told cnn
the deliberations of the nobel committee are usually shrouded in total secrecy
no shortlists for the nobel prizes are revealed and the winners are called shortly before the official announcement
but the swedish academy of sciences inadvertently revealed the names of the winning trio before the official announcement on wednesday
nobel prize in medicine won by two scientists for groundbreaking findings on mrna covid vaccines
swedish newspaper aftonbladet published a copy of an email it said was from the academy reuters reported
aqvist told reuters ahead of the announcement that the email had been a mistake and stressed that a final decision had not been made
but hours later the leaked names were confirmed as laureates
let me say that this is of course very unfortunate
we deeply regret what happened for sure hans ellegren secretary general of royal swedish academy of sciences said at the announcement ceremony
there was a press release sent out for still unknown reasons
we have been very active this morning to trying to find out what actually happened but at this place we don t know that
we deeply regret that this happened
the important thing is that it did not affect the awarding of the prize
