perched on a hill surrounded by tall razor wire fences the bedford hills correctional facility is the only maximum security women s prison in the state of new york
recently more than inmates gathered in person and online at four other facilities to hear from susan burton an author who had done time behind bars herself
for years i cycled in and out of prison just hoping and wishing to find my way burton told the women
i hope my story will help you realize there are no throw away people that your life matters
life had never been easy for burton but the accidental death of her year old son nearly crushed her
she fell into addiction and ended up going to prison without support when she was released she fell into her old ways and ended up going back
six times
it was like i was in a revolving door of incarceration
i would walk out the gates and i would end up going back to prison
over and over again she said
finally i found help
and that led me to a different path
for years burton has dedicated herself to helping formerly incarcerated women in south los angeles avoid that revolving door
through her nonprofit a new way of life reentry project she provides them with housing and a host of resources
since she has helped more than women rebuild their lives
in she was honored as a top cnn hero
she says the global spotlight was a gamechanger
it added this level of legitimacy and integrity that i had been working so hard to accomplish she said
and all of a sudden i was able to get real support to expand the work
and we went from four homes to homes
in she published her autobiography becoming ms
burton which became a bestseller
but as she did book signings in bookstores around the country burton realized that she wasn t reaching an important population
i thought about all the women in prison that needed to have hope so i wanted to get the book to them she said
i set out on a trail to go to as many prisons as i could go and i went to prisons in a year
she gave away more than books hoping to encourage incarcerated women and show that it was possible to rebuild their lives after prison
instead burton saw how desperate many of them were because they didn t have anywhere to go after they were released
i did book signings and those women stood up with tears in their eyes she said
i would lay in my bed at night thinking what could i possibly do i know i can t be everywhere all across the nation
in she launched the sisterhood alliance for freedom and equality known as safe a housing network that trains women to replicate burton s model in their communities
to date she s trained people who have started their own programs of them are formerly incarcerated women
pamela zimba is one of them
after she was released from prison she d ended up living in a homeless shelter
having earned a college degree while incarcerated she managed to get on her feet and ended up working at the ford foundation
but while she d achieved success in many ways she wanted to do more
i wanted to open a house for women coming home so that they don t have to go through the struggles that i went through zimba said
she attended one of the safe trainings in los angeles and found that with burton s help she could realize her dream
she literally gives you all the tools you need to start your house she said
also she gives everybody a grant
she helps you hit the ground running
zimba ended up leaving her job to dedicate herself to this work full time
last july she opened lilac house in mt
vernon new york a home that can accommodate up to seven women
at the opening ceremony she made a point to thank burton who d come in from california to show her support
i m grateful to susan
i pray to one day help as many women as she s been able to help she said
she made my dreams come true
helping people like zimba has been hugely rewarding for burton and it s greatly expanded the reach of her work
the safe network now has homes around the us as well as three in africa and has provided housing to more than women and nonbinary individuals since it began
now when burton visits women in prison she feels that she s offering them more than her story
i go back with something tangible she said
i m coming back saying here s someplace for you to go
jazmin flowers an inmate at bedford hills correctional facility who attended burton s talk and book signing agreed
i thought the event was great
there s a lot of options out there for people she said
susan definitely made me feel more inspired about my future
enabling women like flowers to build better futures is what keeps burton motivated
it s also why she wants to cultivate the next generation of leaders like zimba to continue her work
there are people coming home every year so we have just touched a fraction of the people that need a second chance at life she said
but i feel so pleased with what s been done so far
you plant the seed and it gets watered and it grows
