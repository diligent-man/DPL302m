parked at the curbside of a tree lined street luvly o looks a lot like any other small car
boxy but sleek the modern classic aesthetic of the cream colored vehicle embodies scandi minimalism
it wouldn t look out of place in an ikea showroom for more reasons than one
that s because much like the products sold by the swedish furniture giant it s designed to be delivered to its destination flat packed
stockholm based startup luvly founded in says its debut ready to assemble car is so small and light that it can significantly reduce the carbon emissions associated with shipping
in addition to the novel flat pack delivery luvly is hoping that the electric car s other features including its super light frame and swappable batteries will make sustainable transport more affordable says h kan lutz luvly ceo and co founder
weighing under kilograms pounds less than one quarter of the weight of the average modern car luvly has a range of kilometers miles and a top speed of kilometers miles per hour which lutz says is more than enough for the majority of commutes and daily trips in urban areas
these cars aren t likely to be your next diy project though says lutz to be road legal they will need to be assembled by a licensed car plant before being delivered to customers
although self assembly is not required ikea has been a big influence
lutz says luvly is trying to do for cars what ikea has done for furniture with good enough quality and very nice design cheaply and efficiently for everybody
luvly o is a light urban vehicle also known as a microcar
tiny cars have been zipping around city streets since the s
the iconic bmw isetta which weighed just kilograms pounds popularized the bubble car style that s continued to inspire modern light vehicle design
but while microcars look cute they have a reputation for being unsafe
their low height light frames and limited front crumple zones mean that in accidents particularly with other cars drivers can suffer more serious injuries than in passenger cars
what s more they are not subject to the same safety standards as regular passenger cars and there s no requirement for crash testing
for light vehicles to compete with cars and hopefully out compete cars they must be safe
people will not accept that you switch from driving an suv to driving what is essentially a scooter with a shell

for light vehicles to compete with cars and hopefully out compete cars they must be safe
people will not accept that you switch from driving an suv to driving what is essentially a scooter with a shell says lutz
to address this luvly took inspiration from formula one cars which are built with a light but strong chassis
luvly o s frame has a sandwich structure with a layer of aluminum padded on both sides by lightweight plastic foam
lutz says if the car crashes the force will be absorbed by the padding and protect the driver
although crash testing isn t mandated lutz says that the company is running computer simulations
it s not cheap to use computers but it s a whole lot cheaper than crashing real things he says
luvly o runs on by two rechargeable kilogram batteries which can be swapped with another set so the car is always powered
luvly is still testing the luvly o prototype but hopes to launch the car next year with a price tag of around says lutz
however the microcar isn t luvly s ultimate goal
luvly plans to license its patented light vehicle flat pack framework to other car manufacturers to build their own branded versions
we don t envision that we will be major producers of vehicles but we anticipate we will be minor producers of vehicles to advocate for and develop the technology says lutz
despite wanting to license this to others we also wish to stay on top of the game and be the best at our platform
despite growing consumer preference for larger car models luvly isn t alone in modernizing the microcar
in french automaker citro n unveiled ami a kilogram pound two seat electric microcar that was replicated by german brand opel and italian carmakers fiat
last year swiss urban vehicle manufacturer micro launched the microlino a bubble car that echoes the s isetta minicar
like luvly microlino uses a sportscar inspired chassis to improve safety
microcars are easier to maneuver and they require smaller parking spaces says mascha brost an expert in light vehicles at the german aerospace center
with an estimated of the global population expected to live in cities by urban space is at a premium so smaller cars could free up space for pedestrian use and greenery which will also reduce the amount of trapped heat in urban areas brost adds
nearly of all energy related greenhouse gas emissions come from road passenger vehicles and while last year saw record breaking electric car sales which is helping to cut tailpipe emissions unless the energy and raw materials used in vehicle production can be reduced research suggests the overall benefits of evs is limited
resource light and requiring less energy to manufacture than electric passenger cars light electric vehicles levs such as microcars could make a serious dent in transport carbon emissions says brost
a rather large microcar has only one third of the emissions for production compared to an electric passenger car
mascha brost german aerospace center
a rather large microcar has only one third of the emissions for production compared to an electric passenger car says brost
in a study she conducted on car use and levs in germany brost discovered that up to half of all mileage could be conducted in light vehicles including e bikes mopeds and microcars
this would cut transport emissions by
light vehicles could also improve pedestrian safety says brost
over the past decade the number of pedestrians killed on american roads has ticked steadily upwards according to a study by the research organization insurance institute for highway safety
and in pedestrians killed in traffic accidents in the us reached a year high
this increase is partly due to the soaring popularity of sports utility vehicles suvs
an suv might be very safe for the person that sits in the car but maybe not for other road users brost says
but despite the huge opportunity to replace cars with levs in our cities regulatory and logistical issues are holding them back says brost
sharing the roads with larger faster cars isn t always safe for light vehicles says brost so creating safe operating conditions for levs such as lower speed limits or restricted zones is essential
brost points to peachtree city in georgia us as an example
here a mile long second road network provides safe driving conditions for the town s strong fleet of golf carts and is pedestrian friendly
while it might not be feasible for every city it demonstrates the possibilities for light vehicles she adds
but to attract consumers more variety in lev models is essential says brost
this is where luvly hopes to add value inspiring more car manufacturers to develop light urban vehicles with its patented framework
the service that cars provide it s something good it s beautiful the personal freedom
it s just not very optimized for what we do says lutz
luvly delivers the same service with a fraction of the resources
that s good that s what we need to do
