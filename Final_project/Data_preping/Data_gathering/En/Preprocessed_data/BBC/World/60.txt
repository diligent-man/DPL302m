parked curbside tree-lined street luvly look lot like small car
boxy sleek modern-classic aesthetic cream-colored vehicle embodies scandi minimalism
thats much like product sold swedish furniture giant designed delivered destination flat-packed
stockholm-based startup luvly founded say debut ready-to-assemble car small light significantly reduce carbon emission associated shipping
addition novel flat-pack delivery luvly hoping electric car feature including super-light frame swappable battery make sustainable transport affordable say hkan lutz luvly ceo co-founder
weighing kilogram pound le one-quarter weight average modern car luvly ha range kilometer mile top speed kilometer mile per hour lutz say enough majority commute daily trip urban areas
car arent likely next diy project though say lutz road legal need assembled licensed car plant delivered customers
lutz say luvly trying car ikea ha done furniture good enough quality nice design cheaply efficiently everybody
tiny car zipping around city street since s
iconic bmw isetta weighed kilogram pound popularized bubble car style thats continued inspire modern light vehicle design
low height light frame limited front crumple zone mean accident particularly car driver suffer serious injury passenger cars

people accept switch driving suv driving essentially scooter shell
light vehicle compete car hopefully out-compete car must safe
people accept switch driving suv driving essentially scooter shell say lutz
address luvly took inspiration formula one car built light strong chassis
luvly frame ha sandwich structure layer aluminum padded side lightweight plastic foam
lutz say car crash force absorbed padding protect driver
although crash testing isnt mandated lutz say company running computer simulations
cheap use computer whole lot cheaper crashing real thing says
luvly run two rechargeable kilogram battery swapped another set car always powered
luvly still testing luvly prototype hope launch car next year price tag around say lutz
luvly plan license patented light vehicle flat-pack framework car manufacturer build branded versions
dont envision major producer vehicle anticipate minor producer vehicle advocate develop technology say lutz
despite wanting license others also wish stay top game best platform
despite growing consumer preference larger car model luvly isnt alone modernizing microcar
french automaker citron unveiled ami kilogram pound two-seat electric microcar wa replicated german brand opel italian carmaker fiat
last year swiss urban vehicle manufacturer micro launched microlino bubble car echo isetta minicar
like luvly microlino us sportscar-inspired chassis improve safety
microcars easier maneuver require smaller parking space say mascha brost expert light vehicle german aerospace center
estimated global population expected live city urban space premium smaller car could free space pedestrian use greenery also reduce amount trapped heat urban area brost adds
nearly energy-related greenhouse gas emission come road passenger vehicle last year saw record-breaking electric car sale helping cut tailpipe emission unless energy raw material used vehicle production reduced research suggests overall benefit ev limited
resource-light requiring le energy manufacture electric passenger car light electric vehicle lev microcars could make serious dent transport carbon emission say brost
rather large microcar ha one-third emission production compared electric passenger car
rather large microcar ha one-third emission production compared electric passenger car say brost
study conducted car use lev germany brost discovered half mileage could conducted light vehicle including e-bikes moped microcars
light vehicle could also improve pedestrian safety say brost
past decade number pedestrian killed american road ha ticked steadily upwards according study research organization insurance institute highway safety
pedestrian killed traffic accident u reached year high
increase partly due soaring popularity sport utility vehicle suvs
suv might safe person sits car maybe road user brost says
despite huge opportunity replace car lev city regulatory logistical issue holding back say brost
sharing road larger faster car isnt always safe light vehicle say brost creating safe operating condition lev lower speed limit restricted zone essential
mile-long second road network provides safe driving condition town strong fleet golf cart pedestrian-friendly
might feasible every city demonstrates possibility light vehicle adds
attract consumer variety lev model essential say brost
luvly hope add value inspiring car manufacturer develop light urban vehicle patented framework
service car provide something good beautiful personal freedom
