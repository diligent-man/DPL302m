It sounds like a mathematical problem How do you make one of the world s most famous ancient sites bigger
You can t build more of it You can excavate more but at immense cost
So with ever more tourists cramming onto the site the team behind the archaeological park of Pompeii have found a plan B dispersing visitors around ancient sites that are further afield with all in one tickets and shuttles laid on between the sites
Grande Pompei will be a parco diffuso or scattered archaeological park incorporating the archaeological areas of Pompeii itself as well as villas at nearby Boscoreale Oplontis in the modern town of Torre Annunziata and Stabiae at modern Castellammare di Stabia
In a visit to Pompeii last week speaking to reporters Italy s culture minister Gennaro Sangiuliano dubbed it a scattered museum calling it a program of sustainable enhancement of the archaeological sites of the archaeological park and of the area surrounding it
The sites already form part of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii but until now they have been ticketed separately They are also relatively far apart the park s sites span around miles with little public transport to some of them A shuttle service around the sites the Pompeii Artebus was piloted in
Their inaccessibility means that visitor numbers are low While nearly four million people visited Pompeii itself in just made it to see Villa A thought to have been owned by the emperor Nero and his second wife Poppaea Sabina whom he murdered at Oplontis Only got as far as the two villas at Stabiae Villa Arianna and Villa San Marco
The race against time to save Pompeii
Yet Pompeii is stuffed to the gills Visitor numbers rose from under million in to over million by In July a record people visited the park in a single day
also saw the launch of a direct high speed train to Pompeii from Rome However the train only runs on one Sunday per month adding to the weight of daytrippers The ancient city was the most visited heritage site in Italy on the last Domenica al Museo state run heritage sites have free entry on the first Sunday of the month
Tickets for the scattered site will be valid for three days with free shuttles connecting all the sites
The move will also see the reopening of the Antiquarium a museum beside Boscoreale s Villa Regina It ll have a room dedicated to the current excavations in Civita Giuliana including the ceremonial carriage found in March
The Villa dei Misteri at Pompeii will also get new lighting which will better replicate the original lighting in the villa
The move comes on the heels of the Grande Progetto Pompei or Great Pompeii Project which has overseen renovations across the sites for the past decade funded to the tune of million euros by the European Union
Major excavations have taken place at Civita Giuliana where the remains of horses were discovered in and a chariot in as well as a room that sheds new light on the lives of slaves The project also saw the opening of two new museums in the area the Antiquarium which opened in and the Museo Archeologico di Castellammare di Stabia Libero D Orsi housed at the grand Reggia di Quisisana palace in Castellamare di Stabia
The project has also seen buildings restored an extra hectares of the site opened for visits and a four kilometer accessible loop of Pompeii created for people with reduced mobility

Sangiuliano told reporters this week while celebrating the completion of the project that the new Grande Pompei scheme would see more than million euros of investment
The project will launch October
