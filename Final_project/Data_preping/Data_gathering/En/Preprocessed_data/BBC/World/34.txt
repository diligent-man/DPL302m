Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country is at war Saturday after Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a deadly barrage of rockets and sent gunmen into Israeli territory in a major escalation of the long-running conflict between the two sides.
Israel launched air strikes on Gaza in response to the attack as Netanyahu vowed to "exact a huge price from the enemy."
The early-morning surprise assault is unprecedented in recent history in its scale and scope
It comes on the 50th anniversary of the 1973 War in which Arab states blitzed Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar.
