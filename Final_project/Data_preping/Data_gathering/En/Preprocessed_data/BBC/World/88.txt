Kelli Ritschel Boehle says her son Nik was an amazing and caring person
But I’m sure every mom says the same thing about their children she said
Nik was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer in when he was
He passed away in the spring of
But Nik’s kindness and generosity have lived on long after his death
After he was diagnosed and started treatment Nik was granted a wish experience from the Make-A-Wish Foundation
To him it was like the Willy Wonka golden ticket Ritschel Boehle said
He was always looking for the positive in this situation
He kept coming up with crazy wishes
Nik befriended his wish grantors and asked for things like a pet monkey or to appear on the game show Deal or No Deal before he landed on a vacation to Hawaii with his family so they could spend time away together
For just this period of time we didn’t think about cancer Ritschel Boehle said
All we thought about is ‘Here we are together happy just enjoying our time together’ And it was beautiful
A year later Nik met another young man going through cancer treatment
He’d been diagnosed a month after turning and Nik learned he was too old to qualify for a wish
That broke Nik’s heart Ritschel Boehle said he wanted his friend to receive the same joy he had
The night before Nik passed away he asked Ritschel Boehle to help make sure that young adults fighting cancer could have their wishes come true too
It was like a seed he planted that just wouldn’t stop nagging at my mind until the point where it was waking me up in the middle of the night she said
In with the help of family and friends Ritschel Boehle started Nik’s Wish
The nonprofit grants wishes to young adults between the ages of and who are battling cancer
Nate the -year-old Nik had met in treatment was the organization’s first wish recipient
He chose to visit his grandmother in California and have a family reunion
Today the organization grants wishes that run the gamut
They have gifted gaming computers concert tickets meet and greet events with celebrities and vacations
The one thing in common is it has to bring them joy and know that they’re loved and that we’re fighting for them too Ritschel Boehle said
In April Abigail Savage a -year-old who was battling terminal cancer was surprised at her home by Ritschel Boehle and more than a dozen volunteers to let her know her wish was coming true
The group arrived with its -foot genie lamp sculpture in tow built by Ritschel Boehle and her husband for wish deliveries
They carried signs and cheered making sure Savage knew she had a team of people supporting her
This was the biggest surprise of my whole life and the best biggest surprise Savage told CNN
So this beats that like by a lot
When Savage became too sick to travel by plane to Hawaii her original wish her experience was adjusted to something that ultimately became even more meaningful for her and her family
She was able to travel in an RV across the country to her hometown in Montana and visit family before she passed away last month
Savage had battled the disease for five years
I have obviously never known when my health is going to take a pivot Savage said
So it’s important to make these kind of memories with my family
Once the recipient and their family learn that their wish is granted a dedicated volunteer wish maker works closely with them making all the arrangements
The goal is that all details are taken care of by the organization so they can just enjoy their wish experience and precious time together
In the beginning Ritschel Boehle says she wasn’t sure she could be a wish maker and work closely with the young adults it was too painful for her to relive those memories of Nik
But now it’s her favorite thing to do
At first I wasn’t strong enough to do it she said
But I recently helped my th person as a wish maker
I just love speaking with them and getting to know them
Recently -year-old Jordan Morrow received her wish to attend a Taylor Swift concert as part of a trip to Los Angeles
When I walked into the first day of radiation they asked me who my favorite singer was and I said ‘Taylor Swift’ And they said ‘Okay we’ll try to have some Taylor Swift music playing every day for you’ Morrow said
She got me through some hard times
For Morrow who has spent the last year battling brain cancer going to the concert and touring LA has done more than lift her spirits
I think it’s something to get me through whatever comes my way she said
And I’m thankful for Nik’s Wish for that
In the years since Nik passed away the organization has granted more than wishes across more than states
But for Ritschel Boehle the reason behind every wish remains the same
I think he is looking down from heaven telling me ‘I told you Mom
I think he’s always encouraging me always helping me out
