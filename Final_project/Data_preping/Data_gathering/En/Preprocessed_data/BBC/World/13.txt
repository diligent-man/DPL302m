the militants also took over military bases near the border capturing military vehicles and setting fire to tanks
in some cases fighters advanced for a few miles into communities near the security fence separating gaza from israel taking civilians captive
cnn has examined nearly a dozen hamas propaganda videos using analysis and geolocation to piece together what happened in key locations
these videos published by hamas on their social media channels were heavily edited by the terror group
at a nearby outdoor music festival taking place just under two miles from the border some attendees told cnn that they first became aware of the attack from the sound of rockets
a video posted to a hamas social media account shows an attack near one section of the border fence when a drone filmed an attack on an israeli tank
nearby in a separate video smoke is seen rising near a fresh breach to a fence
the video showed an israeli tank burning near that breach
concertgoers said gunfire began roughly minutes after they first heard rockets and explosions
two attendees told cnn that they had already begun to evacuate the area because of the rockets when they realized they needed to run to escape bullets
the militants advanced all the way to a kibbutz about three miles southeast from the border with gaza according to the idf
videos geolocated by cnn show armed militants moving around the be eri kibbutz and taking multiple israelis captive
the current whereabouts of these hostages is unknown but cnn confirmed at least some of the festival attendees were filmed being paraded around gaza by armed militants
a video geolocated by cnn shows militants from gaza entering the erez military facility after breaching the border with explosives
the erez crossing is the main border crossing between the gaza strip and israel
the fighters are then seen firing at a guard tower and moving inside what appear to be the living quarters of the military base
the first person view video continues with one gunman shooting at a man covered in blood on the ground while other militants appear to take two israeli men hostage
as the fighters move deeper inside the base grabbing an israeli flag and taking over an israeli jeep several lifeless bodies can be seen on the ground
video posted by hamas shows at least two paragliders shortly after take off flying in the direction of zikim a kibbutz just over the border
behind them a barrage of rockets fired on the edge of a field just north of beit lahia gaza are seen flying northward
this video is the earliest image of paragliders from during the attack to have been geolocated by cnn
the idf claimed to have killed two hamas assailants on zikim beach it s not known whether these were the two paragliders seen in the video

dozens of gaza fighters armed with guns grenades and bomb dropping drones also took control of a military base outside of nahal oz a video geolocated by cnn shows
at least two israeli soldiers were killed by the militants and at least six female soldiers at the base are seen being taken prisoner in the videos
the assault began with armed men sneaking between two hills near a gate along the israel gaza border fence
they are then seen approaching and moving past a watchtower the military base s large communication tower is seen in the distance
once past the militants dozens of them dressed in dark clothes are seen moving across the open towards the base
another video filmed around the same time by a weaponized drone appears to have shown the start of the ambush
three israeli troops standing near a van on the southern portion of the base are seen before the drone drops at least two bombs onto them one appears to be seriously injured and the trio is then seen taking cover next to a nearby military vehicle
one of the videos shows militants throwing a grenade on top of a moving israeli military vehicle just outside of the base
it s unclear from the videos how many troops were stationed at the base or if there were extensive firefights there
another video shows several individuals some of whom appear to be looting the base on top of and around a few tanks on the base property
a thick plume of black smoke is also seen
