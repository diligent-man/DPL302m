editor s note cnn style is one of the official media partners of paris fashion week
see all coverage here
it was an emotional nine days in paris
the energy was high even though many attendees were tired after a long season of shows across new york london and milan and with unpredictable weather in each city
paris proved to be no different
bursts of rain were a nice welcome amid muggy heat in many venues invitations were used as make shift fans and some showgoers carried handheld electric ones to keep cool
these proved to be a shrewd accessory choice in particular at shows which ran late some by almost an hour
in other words not just fashionably late to be fair the tardiness was partially due to the hordes of fashion fans gathered outside
at some of the bigger shows it was near pandemonium and some in the crowds were seemingly at risk of getting run over by oncoming traffic
there was much anticipation this season for designers making their paris debut including peter do fresh from showing his inaugural collection for helmut lang in new york francesco risso of marni and stefano gallici for ann demeulemeester having been appointed the brand s new creative director in june
helmut lang returns to the runway with ascendant designer peter do at the helm
paris is a dream come true do said after the show
i feel really grown up and i wanted to make grown up clothes and i feel like paris is the right place for the new year old pd sensibility to exist
but there were also fond farewells none more emotional than sarah burton s leaving alexander mcqueen a fashion house where she had spent her entire career
burton worked as lee mcqueen s right hand for years and after his untimely death took over as the brand s creative director
polish artist magdalena abakanowicz s large scale woven textiles featuring tightly wound coils with rope detailing trailing below were placed around the room as a backdrop to the show which included rose printed silk dresses intricate knitwear and impeccable tailoring seen in fitted blazers with cut outs adapted from earlier mcqueen designs
naomi campbell closed the show in a silver beaded dress with a heart shaped breastplate tears streaming down her face as the room rose to a standing ovation
burton then took her final bow hugging and thanking many in the front row including anna wintour and tim blanks
she dedicated her final collection to her mentor mcqueen himself and her team
taking a different timbre gabriela hearst celebrated her last collection for chloe with live music from a samba school flown in from brazil everyone in attendance was up and dancing
meanwhile over at miu miu it was a heartfelt adieu to fabio zambernardi after more than four decades with the prada group as in milan miuccia prada came out and took a bow with him one last time
paris fashion week has always drawn a high profile crowd but this season with the sag afra strikes in hollywood seemingly freeing up actors schedules the front rows felt even more packed than usual
famous faces popped up on and off the runways paris hilton angela bassett and fan bingbing who all walked in the mugler show jared leto sigourney weaver and cher sat front row at givenchy
usher in town for a series of sold out concerts stunned at marni in a red and black polka dot ensemble

at miu miu sydney sweeney emma chamberlain zaya wade and mia goth made for an eclectic tr s trendy front row cate blanchett appeared at louis vuitton alongside zendaya who wore a dramatic white double zipper dress that has gone viral
many a runway show this season featured conceptual looks and wearable art with designers incorporating new materials and couture techniques into their collections
jun takahashi of undercover presented one of the buzziest moments of the season with three sculptural soft lit looks closing the show complete with live butterflies
the dresses skirts were revealed to be terrariums with real flowers
francesco risso punctuated his collection at marni with a series of floral dresses made using tin cans meanwhile and junya watanabe looked at architecture this season actualized in an angular collection featuring prism like shapes jutting out from the garments in every direction
there was dark drama at mugler but created using the sheerest of fabrics
casey cadwallader told journalists backstage he was inspired by things under the sea like jellyfish octopi and squid things that have fluid motions long veils of chiffon trailed models like seaweed to stunning effect as they walked down the runway wearing resin body plates bustiers structured blazers and bodycon dresses with corseted waists
rick owens also sent out veiled models but with face covers reminiscent of beekeeper s masks zimmermann had a more romantic approach to using the lightweight fabric sending voluminous floral georgette and charmeuse dresses with ruffled detailing down the runway
tulle opera gloves featherweight dresses in silk chiffons and double layered silk skirts with floral motifs at givenchy gave the collection an ethereal sensibility that was elegant and refined
shows were scattered all over the city and at all sorts of venues sacai at a car park space for example while both dries van noten and y project presented their shows in an abandoned post office a space required guests to hike up three flights of uneven stairs
karl lagerfeld s former apartment in the picturesque seventh arrondissement was also a venue twice over marni and victoria beckham both used the gilded space to present vastly different collections
on the one hand it was the perfect juxtaposition for marni s effervescent and colorful collection but it was equally majestic when victoria beckham presented more minimalistic dance inspired designs this season
even the tardiness of kim kardashian and kris jenner who kept everyone waiting for nearly an hour could not detract from the charm of the occasion
and who could forget the construction site on the champs elysee turned runway venue for louis vuitton the space is currently under renovations by lvmh its interior was covered in orange recyclable plastic for the show to give the ambiance of a hot air balloon
amid increasingly crowded fashion calendars performances and stunts that supersede the traditional runway format are a way for designers to stand out from the pack
issey miyake continues to explore movement in its runway shows this season with musicians imitating chirping and other sounds found in nature
dancers clad in black and white took over the show space manipulating fabric suspended from the ceiling as models presented a collection inspired by the founder s collection with swaths of sheer fabrics ruched into figure hugging dresses
valentino invited fka twigs and a group of contemporary dancers to perform in skin colored separates the end result proved almost more memorable than the collection itself while at balenciaga demna transformed the cour du d me des invalides into a theater covering it with red velvet drapes and an elevated runway where people who have inspired him including his mother and fashion journalist cathy horyn walked the runway
noticeably absent however was his younger brother guram gvasalia who co founded vetements with demna but now runs the business solo
perhaps the hottest topic and biggest stunt if you will to come out of paris fashion week has nothing to do with fashion but everything to do with fabric unfortunately bed bugs have been plaguing the city and potentially crashing the runways
just as the shows started reports of bed bug sightings on public transport homes hotels and cinemas spread across the city and around the world
paris deputy mayor emmanuel gr goire announced no one is safe
opinion a very french response to paris bedbug bedlam
an insect infestation is the spring summer trend no one was asking for attendees at the shows are surely hoping these blood sucking freeloaders won t be going home with them
