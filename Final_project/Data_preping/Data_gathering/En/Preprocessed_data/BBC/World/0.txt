when tescha hawley received her breast cancer diagnosis at age she was raising two young children on her own and working full time for the federal government
she and her family lived on the fort belknap reservation in montana where she grew up
the lifesaving treatment she needed several times a month was at a hospital more than miles away a three hour drive
hawley a member of the gros ventre tribe has two master s degrees one in social work and the other in health administration
yet the challenges she had to navigate to receive the care she needed were daunting
you get caught up in the emotions and are not thinking logically hawley said
the only thing that i could think of was am i going to die
native americans in the united states have the lowest life expectancy and the highest rate of death in many categories of preventable illness
as american indian people we represent the highest rates of everything diabetes heart disease cancer and we receive the poorest health care hawley said
after her experience hawley was inspired to help other cancer patients and their families living on the reservation
she founded the day eagle hope project in and her nonprofit has since expanded to address many other needs of native americans in her community
the indian health service ihs an agency within the department of health and human services is tasked with providing federal health services to american indians and alaska natives
but hawley says the agency is underfunded services are inconsistent and equipment can be dated
in hawley s case she says she experienced delays in treatment while dealing with a complicated system of healthcare providers insurance and approvals
she also had to drive more than miles roundtrip to and from billings montana for chemo and radiation treatment that she spent a year receiving
the cost of hotel food and gas is huge and it s a financial burden for everybody hawley said
we ve seen the wind chills get below below and we had foot drifts in some areas
for me a few times after receiving treatment we would get halfway home and have to turn around because it was blizzard conditions
as a single mother hawley ultimately took leave without pay to complete her treatment
she says she had dollars in her checking account when she finished treatment and was grateful to family and friends who supported her through the process
she knew others on her reservation battling cancer who didn t have that kind of support
i had been in remission for two months and i pulled out my computer and that s when day eagle hope project was started said hawley whose daughter was at the time
her cree name in english translates to day eagle woman
this was formed in honor of her and all of our young women so they will be strong and help our people in a good way
in the beginning hawley s family loaned their time and vehicles for transportation
hawley and her aunt drove cancer patients to and from treatment and hawley provided gift cards for gas food and hotels for those in need on her reservation where many live below the poverty level and lack transportation and cell phone service
she also offered support workshops to connect anyone with medical hardships to available services
cancer affects every one of us she said
cancer affects your mental health it affects your spiritual well being it affects your entire family
we take great pride in being able to help everybody not just tribal people but also non indian people
as she focused on patient navigation hawley says she saw a need to address food insecurity as well
residents in her community are living in a food desert and access to fresh and healthy food is scarce
we have so many grandparents raising grandchildren and many generations of families are living in one household unit
it s not uncommon for three and four families to be residing in one dwelling hawley said
hawley began doing fresh food deliveries acquiring organic foods from local farmers to distribute across the reservation which encompasses acres of the plains and grasslands of north central montana
in addition to lean organic beef and fruits and vegetables she s also incorporated a program to provide fresh buffalo meat to the community
done in a culturally respectful way veterans are given the honor of harvesting the buffalo
our ancestors prayed that our buffalo would sustain us
and that s exactly what s happening today with our non profit work hawley said
we ve joined in collaboration with our tribe to give back to our community
after each harvest thousands of pounds of organic lean meat are distributed to communities across the reservation feeding hundreds of families who are often struggling
hawley also runs programs to address crisis and chemical addiction and offers equine therapy to at risk youth as a suicide prevention effort
in the winter with temperatures dipping into the negative s with wind chill hawley brings firewood to native elders
hawley estimates she s helped about people not only on her reservation but from neighboring tribes as well
prior to my diagnosis of cancer i thought my life was based on my professional career and my education hawley said
i still strongly believe education is our key out of poverty but now i know that this is my calling
