Lhonak Lake is a large glacial bullet-shaped water body that sits at the foot of a melting glacier
An analysis of the images shows more than of the water held in the lake drained out after the extreme rainstorm triggered a glacial lake outburst
This phenomenon happens when a glacial lake rises too high or the surrounding land or ice gives way and the lake bursts sending water and debris rushing down mountains
Scientists have long studied Lhonak Lake identifying it as one of the fastest swelling glacial lakes in the region with a high risk for a potential glacial outburst according to multiple studies
Mukesh Kumar a -year-old migrant worker in Rangpo described how he and his neighbors had barely minutes to escape before the flash flood hit
