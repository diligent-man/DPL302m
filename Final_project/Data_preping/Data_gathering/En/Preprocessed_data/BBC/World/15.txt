in response to the attack israel launched operation swords of iron striking a number of targets in the gaza strip
netanyahu said israel s response to the hamas incursion will exact a huge price from the group
the idf urged civilians in gaza to leave their residential areas immediately for their safety as israeli military operations continued to target hamas
inside gaza the roar of israeli warplanes could be heard followed by loud explosions and rising plumes of black smoke
at least people were killed over hours including at least children the palestinian ministry of health in gaza said sunday
another were injured it added
on sunday the idf said it struck targets in gaza including towers it said were used by hamas

the area is considered by lebanon as israeli occupied
israel responded by firing artillery
and in the israeli occupied west bank seven palestinians were killed by israeli soldiers on saturday when clashes broke out after the israeli army blocked west bank cities according to the palestinian ministry of health
tensions between israel and the palestinians have existed since before the nation s founding in
thousands of people on both sides have been killed and many more injured in the long simmering conflict between the two sides over decades
violence has been particularly heightened this year
the number of palestinians militants and civilians killed in the occupied west bank by israeli forces is at its highest in nearly two decades
the same is true of israelis and foreigners most of them civilians killed in palestinian attacks
israel and hamas have been involved in armed conflict dating back as early as the first palestinian intifada or uprising against israel s occupation of the gaza strip and the west bank
israel captured gaza from egypt in a war then withdrew in
the territory home to some million palestinians fell under hamas control in after a brief civil war with fatah a rival palestinian faction that is the backbone of the palestinian authority

israel also maintains an air and naval blockade on gaza
before saturday s operation the last war between hamas and israel was in which lasted for days and killed at least people in gaza and in israel
saturday s assault occurred on the th anniversary of the war when israel s arab neighbors launched a surprise attack on israel on yom kippur the holiest day in the jewish calendar on october
hamas is an islamist organization with a military wing that came into being in emerging out of the muslim brotherhood a sunni islamist group that was founded in the late s in egypt
the word hamas is itself an acronym for harakat al muqawama al islamia arabic for islamic resistance movement
the group like most palestinian factions and political parties insists that israel is an occupying power and that it is trying to liberate the palestinian territories
it considers israel an illegitimate state
its refusal to recognize israel is one reason why it has rejected peace talks in the past
in it opposed the oslo accords a peace pact between israel and the palestine liberation organization plo
the group presents itself as an alternative to the palestinian authority pa which has recognized israel and has engaged in multiple failed peace initiatives with it
the pa is today led by mahmoud abbas and is based in the israeli occupied west bank

the al aqsa compound is one of the most revered places in islam and judaism
the sacred grounds known to muslims as al haram al sharif noble sanctuary and to jews as temple mount have been a flashpoint of tensions between israel and the palestinians for decades
hamas says it launched saturday s al aqsa storm attack in part to defend the holy site
only muslims are allowed to pray in the compound under a status quo arrangement originally reached more than a century ago
non muslim visitors are allowed visits at certain times and only to certain areas of the complex
but many in the muslims world fear that the right to be the sole worshipers there has been eroded and that the sites themselves are being threatened by a growing far right jewish movement and israel s far right government
clashes have frequently broken out at the site between palestinian worshipers and israeli forces
police raided the compound several times over the last year
the complex lies in east jerusalem which the palestinians want as the capital of their future state and which most of the international community considers to be occupied territory
