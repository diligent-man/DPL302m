israel s prime minister benjamin netanyahu declared that the country was at war on saturday after palestinian militants in gaza fired a deadly barrage of rockets and sent gunmen into israeli territory in a major escalation of the long running conflict between the two sides
the israeli military said about rockets were launched from the gaza strip into israel while armed terror groups infiltrated into israel by land sea and air in paragliders
multiple explosions were heard over jerusalem tel aviv and in southern israel some blasts likely the interceptions of incoming rockets while air raids sent israelis pouring into underground shelters
the israel defense forces idf said hamas had taken hostages and prisoners of war but did not give a figure
at least israelis had been killed and have been wounded according to israel s emergency rescue service and health ministry
israel responded by launching strikes on what it called hamas targets in gaza
the palestine tower a high rise building which hosts residential apartments and media offices in gaza city was hit by an explosion and collapsed video showed
the palestinian health ministry said that palestinians had been killed and injured but did not say where the deaths occurred or whether the toll included hamas militants or civilians in gaza
netanyahu has said operations are already under way to clear communities that have been infiltrated by terrorists and that he had also issued a call up of reservists
he also vowed retribution against hamas the palestinian militant movement that runs gaza in a televised speech what happened today has never been seen in israel we will take mighty vengeance for this black day netanyahu said
i tell hamas you are responsible for the wellbeing of captives israel will settle the score with anyone who harms them netanyahu said adding that israel would turn hamas associated locations into islands of ruins
residents of gaza leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere he said
a fresh round of rockets was fired by gaza militants on saturday evening making direct hits on multiple locations inside israel including in tel aviv according to israeli authorities
in a telegram post the armed wing of hamas the militant group designated as a terrorist organization by the united states european union and israel said it had fired an additional rockets in response to the bombing of the residential tower
the surprise assault on saturday was unprecedented in recent history in its scale and scope falling on the th anniversary of the war in which arab states blitzed israel on yom kippur the holiest day of the jewish calendar
idf spokesman lt col richard hecht said in a briefing that israeli forces are fighting on the ground as we speak listing multiple locations where fighting was taking place including several villages army bases and border crossings
hecht declined to answer repeated questions from journalists about whether the idf had missed intelligence that the attack was coming
a former idf international spokesperson jonathan conricus described the massive surprise attack as a pearl harbor type of moment for the country
the entire system failed
it s not just one component
it s the entire defense architecture that evidently failed to provide the necessary defense for israeli civilians he said
dubbing the operation al aqsa storm hamas military commander muhammad al deif said in a recorded message that the group had targeted the enemy positions airports and military positions with rockets and that the assault on israel was a response to attacks on women the desecration of the al aqsa mosque in jerusalem and the ongoing siege of gaza
if you have a gun get it out
this is the time to use it get out with trucks cars axes today the best and most honorable history starts al deif added
the attacks by hamas follow one of the deadliest periods in the israeli occupied west bank in nearly two decades
the violence has been driven by frequent israeli military raids in palestinian towns and cities which israel has said are a necessary response to a rising number of attacks by palestinian militants on israelis
they also come at a moment of deep division in israel months after the government pushed through a contentious plan to reduce the power of the country s courts sparking a social and political crisis
the move this summer also struck a nerve with the military prompting many reservists the backbone of israel s army to warn they would not come if called up to protest the changes to the judicial system
an idf spokesperson said saturday that he did not know of any reservists refusing to be called up in the face of the latest attacks
it is rare for palestinian militants to be able to make it into israel from gaza which is sealed off and heavily watched by israel s military
as the day unfolded the idf said it was fighting in locations later adding that its operations has seen ground and aerial forces thwarted hundreds of terrorists in the area surrounding the gaza strip and southern israel
another idf spokesman brigadier general daniel hagari said there were hostage situations in two locations ofakim and beeri

why the israeli palestinian conflict is escalating

her face is bleeding and her wrists appear to be cable tied behind her back
the jeep also appears to have an israel defense forces license plate suggesting it may have been stolen and brought into gaza
a second video which appears to show hamas militants taking multiple israelis captive was geolocated by cnn to be eri in southern israel which is a village close to gaza
residents of kibbutz beeri and kibbutz nir oz two israeli communities told the country s channel television station that assailants from gaza were trying to break into their homes
they have repeatedly pleaded on television for assistance from the idf
one resident of kibbutz nir oz told the broadcaster over the phone that his family including two children ages and have barricaded themselves in a safe room while militants fired at the door

israeli authorities did not immediately confirm any details about those reports

gaza is one of the most densely packed places in the world an isolated coastal enclave of almost million people crammed into square miles

egypt controls gaza s southern border crossing rafah
