israel has declared war on the palestinian militant group hamas after it carried out an unprecedented attack by air sea and land on saturday
the large scale surprise assault has left dead in israel prompting a lethal volley of retaliatory israeli airstrikes on gaza that killed at least people
as they retreated into gaza the militants took at least hostages with them hamas said
israel has pledged that hamas will pay a heavy price and may now be preparing a ground incursion into gaza
here s what we know so far
militants from gaza fired thousands of rockets towards israeli towns on saturday morning before breaking through the heavily fortified border fence with israel and sending militants deep into israeli territory
there hamas gunmen killed hundreds of people including civilians and soldiers and took hostages sometimes from their homes
it took israeli troops more than two days to take back control as fighting raged in the streets
on monday the israel defense forces idf said it had retaken control of all israeli communities in gaza s vicinity on its southern border after fighting with hamas ended
the attacks were unprecedented in tactic and scale as israel has not faced its adversaries in street battles on its own territory since the arab israeli war
it has also never faced a terror attack of this magnitude that has taken the lives of so many civilians
while hamas has kidnapped israelis before it has never before taken dozens of hostages at once including children and the elderly
hamas called the operation al aqsa storm and said that the assault was a response to what it described as israeli attacks on women the desecration of the al aqsa mosque in jerusalem and the ongoing siege of gaza
in response to the attack israel has declared war and launched operation swords of iron striking around hamas and islamic jihad targets in gaza so far and killing hundreds in the process
the idf has urged civilians in gaza to leave their residential areas immediately for their safety as israeli military operations continue to target hamas and shut all crossings between israel and gaza potentially setting the stage for a ground incursion into the enclave
israeli minister of defense yoav gallant said on monday that he had ordered a complete siege on gaza
no electricity no food no fuel
everything closed he said adding that no water will be delivered either
at least had been killed in gaza as of monday including at least children the palestinian ministry of health in gaza said
another were injured
tensions between israelis and the palestinians have existed since before israel s founding in
thousands of people on both sides have been killed and many more injured over decades
violence has been particularly acute this year
the number of palestinians militants and civilians killed in the occupied west bank by israeli forces since the year began is the highest in nearly two decades
the same is true of israelis and foreigners most of them civilians killed in palestinian attacks
israel captured gaza from egypt in the war then withdrew its troops and settlers in
the territory home to some million palestinians fell under hamas control in after a brief civil war with fatah a rival palestinian faction that is the backbone of the palestinian authority
after hamas seized control israel and egypt imposed a strict siege on the territory which is ongoing
israel also maintains an air and naval blockade on gaza
human rights watch has called the territory an open air prison more than half of its population lives in poverty and is food insecure and nearly of its population relies on humanitarian assistance
hamas and israel have fought several wars
before saturday s operation the last war between the two was in which lasted for days and killed at least people in gaza and in israel
saturday s assault occurred years almost to the day since the war when israel s arab neighbors launched a surprise attack on israel on yom kippur the holiest day in the jewish calendar on october
hamas is an islamist organization with a military wing that came into being in emerging out of the muslim brotherhood a sunni islamist group that was founded in the late s in egypt
the group like most palestinian factions and political parties insists that israel is an occupying power and that it is trying to liberate the palestinian territories
it considers israel an illegitimate state and has called for its downfall
unlike some other palestinian factions hamas refuses to engage with israel
in it opposed the oslo accords a peace pact between israel and the palestine liberation organization plo that saw the plo give up armed resistance against israel in return for promises of an independent palestinian state alongside israel
the accords also established the palestinian authority pa in the israeli occupied west bank
hamas presents itself as an alternative to the pa which has recognized israel and has engaged in multiple failed peace initiatives with it
the pa whose credibility among palestinians has suffered over the years is today led by president mahmoud abbas
hamas has over the years claimed many attacks on israel and has been designated as a terrorist organization by the united states the european union and israel
israel accuses its archenemy iran of backing the group
israel is now on a war footing and has already started mobilizing troops for a potential ground operation in gaza
it has said that it will exact a heavy price on hamas for its attack and plans to retrieve israeli hostages from the territory
israel has dealt with hostage situations before but never at this scale
in the past militants have mostly demanded the release of prisoners held in israeli jails in exchange for captured israelis
in israel traded palestinians for israeli soldier gilad shalit and in it released more than two dozen lebanese and arab prisoners including two senior hezbollah officials for elhanan tannenbaum an israeli businessman and army reserve colonel as well as the bodies of three idf soldiers
in israel released five palestinian prisoners five lebanese prisoners and returned the bodies of nearly arab fighters in exchange for the bodies of two israeli soldiers
it is unclear what the militants will demand for the or more hostages hamas says it has taken captive
their presence in gaza will undoubtedly complicate any israeli military operation there
in the meantime the idf says it plans to take control of the gaza strip
its spokesperson lt
richard hecht said the aim is to end the gaza enclave and control the entire enclave
senior hamas member saleh al arouri told al jazeera arabic on saturday that hamas is ready for all options including a war and an escalation on all levels
we are ready for the worst case scenario including a ground invasion which will be the best for us to decide the ending of this battle al arouri said
hamas operation was carried out in a sophisticated and coordinated manner and would have taken a significant amount of planning
speculation has been rife that the group may have received assistance from abroad which if proven could raise the specter of a wider regional war
israel says iran supports hamas to the tune of some million dollars a year
the us state department in said that the group receives funding weapons and training from iran as well as some funds that are raised in gulf arab countries
of course iran is in the picture one us official told cnn
they ve provided support for years to hamas and hezbollah
a senior biden administration official said on saturday that it was too early to say whether iran was directly involved in the attack but that washington will be tracking the matter very closely
iranian president ebrahim raisi spoke to hamas leader ismail haniyeh by phone on sunday and later congratulated the palestinian people for their victory over israel
on monday however iran s mission to the united nations said that the islamic republic was not involved in palestine s response referring to the hamas attack
it is taken solely by palestine itself it said
the us has meanwhile sent a carrier strike group to the eastern mediterranean sea according to defense secretary lloyd austin
a us official told cnn that the us is also sending more fighter jets to the middle east to deter any iranian potential aggression or an expansion of the fighting beyond israel s borders
israel may also face the threat of new fronts opening in the war
of its immediate neighbors it is only at peace with jordan and egypt and is officially in a state of war with lebanon and syria
israel has said it is ready in case there are attacks from those two countries
the lebanese militant group hezbollah which is backed by iran has praised hamas attack and said it is in contact with palestinian militant groups at home and abroad its al manar channel said
on sunday the group claimed responsibility for targeting three israeli sites in an area known as shebaa farms using missiles and artillery
the area is considered by lebanon as israeli occupied
israel responded by firing artillery
on monday the idf said it killed a number of armed suspects who infiltrated into israel from lebanon and that soldiers were searching the area
lebanese prime minister designate najib mikati said on monday that his country doesn t want to be drawn into the conflict
