Following several years of planning a pandemic closure a temporaryreopening and a m makeover the National Museum of Women in the Arts NMWA in Washington DC officially reopens on October showcasing reconfigured galleries and event spaces as well as a cleaned exterior
An ambitious new exhibition The Sky s the Limit will welcome visitors back to the museum The show features more than previously unexhibited large scale sculptures and immersive installations by living artists including Rina Banerjee Shinique Smith and Ursula von Rydingsvard
For the museum s first full renovation since it opened in the goal was to rethink the exhibition spaces but without changing the historic footprint said Susan Fisher Sterling NMWA s director of more than years in an interview
With the help of Baltimore based architecture firm Sandra Vicchio Associates the museum s once small galleries have been opened up and expanded with more space for easier flow and more connections between artworks Sterling said
With a focus on advocacy an important part of NMWA s mission the museum s reinstalled permanent collection continues a tradition of organization by theme from landscapes to still lifes fiber art and even a couple of spaces focused on specific colors Chronology ends up being the enemy of women artists and artists of color said NMWA s chief curator Kathryn Wat in an interview noting that these artists tend to be crammed towards the end of exhibitions when your feet and back hurt
Many of the newly installed works from the permanent collection have never been seen before acquired in the past several years while the museum was closed And in order to create a more flexible exhibition space for future shows and support the new large scale sculpture exhibition the architects reinforced the museum s walls from top to bottom Now we can hang anywhere on the wall Wat said

Perhaps the most dramatic transformation has been of the museum s upper floors which now host new galleries a performance hall and a learning space NMWA also made improvements to its accessibility bettered its digital resources and revamped its research library which is now open to the public
Sterling is particularly excited about a new studio space for community art classes It s the first time we have an artmaking space she said Understanding art means understanding how things are made and there s now a transparent connection here between exhibitions artmaking spaces and education
