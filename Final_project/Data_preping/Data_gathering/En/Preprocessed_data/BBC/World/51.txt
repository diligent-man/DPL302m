discovery fossilized footprint made whats new mexico wa made public wa bombshell moment archaeology seemingly rewriting chapter human story
look like could made yesterday footprint pressed mud year ago according radiocarbon dating seed aquatic plant preserved fossils
date dramatically pushed back timeline human history america last landmass settled prehistoric people
dated print discovered tularosa basin near edge ancient lake white sand national park made time many scientist think massive ice sheet sealed human passage north america indicating human arrived region even earlier
however archaeologist questioned age footprint established initial findings
skeptic noted aquatic plant ruppia cirrhosa one used study acquire carbon dissolved atom water rather air result misleadingly early date
follow-up study published thursday journal science researcher said produced two new line evidence support initial dates
even original work wa published forging ahead test result multiple line evidence said kathleen springer research geologist u geological survey co-lead author new science paper news release
confident original age well strong geologic hydrologic stratigraphic evidence knew independent chronologic control wa critical
early human first migrated america ha long debated remains poorly understood
current estimate first inhabitant range year ago year ago
however earliest archaeological evidence region settlement sparse often controversial making footprint especially important
follow-up study researcher focused radiocarbon dating conifer pollen come terrestrial plant avoids issue arise dating aquatic plant ruppia according news release
scientist able isolate grain pollen collected exact layer original seed sample
thousand grain required achieve mass necessary single radiocarbon measurement
team also used dating technique known optically stimulated luminescence determines last time quartz grain fossil sediment exposed sunlight
immediate reaction circle archaeological community wa accuracy dating wa insufficient make extraordinary claim human present north america last glacial maximum said jeff pigati usgs geologist co-lead author study
study help illuminate grand story human evolution still much remains unknown america populated
clear whether early human arrived boat came land bridge asia
despite advance genetic evidence clear whether one many population early modern human made long journey
bente philippsen associate professor radiocarbon dating expert norwegian university science technology said determining age pollen grain intricate process come risk contamination
mysterious fairy circle identified hundred site worldwide new study says
whats noted commentary published alongside study date derived luminescence large measurement uncertainties
however said new study finding overall strongly indicate human presence america around time last glacial maximum period year ago two massive ice sheet covered northern third north america reaching far south new york city cincinnati de moines iowa
ice cold temperature would made journey asia alaska impossible time meaning people made footprint likely arrived much earlier
jennifer raff associate professor university kansa author origin genetic history america said footprint finding big deal field
american continent last step modern human global journey across world said via email
