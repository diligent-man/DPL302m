The move was first spotted by an Australia based digital policy think tank Reset Australia The group of researchers sent an open letter to X warning of the potential harms this can cause as it came just weeks ahead of a major referendum vote on whether to change the Australian constitution to establish an Indigenous advisory group with a direct line to government
There now appears to be no channel to report electoral misinformation when discovered on your platform the letter from Reset Australia states It is extremely concerning that Australians would lose the ability to report serious misinformation weeks away from a major referendum
The rollback also comes as political campaigning for the United States presidential election ramps up and concerns about the spread of misinformation online remains a keystone issue ahead of the US vote
X did not immediately respond to CNN s request for comment Wednesday morning X users notably can still report content on the platform for violations in other categories such as Hate Abuse Harassment and Violent Speech among other issues Musk has also long touted the platforms Community Notes feature which lets users add context they think is missing to posts
The user reporting feature initially launched as a test for a small group of users in the US South Korea and Australia X then called Twitter announced in August The feature allowed users to report a post as it s misleading when they encountered problematic political content In January the company said it was expanding the misinformation reporting feature to more countries and users
