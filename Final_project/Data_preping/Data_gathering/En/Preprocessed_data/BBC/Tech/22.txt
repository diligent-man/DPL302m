netflix will send out its last red envelope on friday marking an end to years of mailing dvds to members
the company announced earlier this year it is shutting down its dvd by mail service years after it gradually shifted its focus to streaming content online
netflix will continue to accept returns of customers remaining dvds until october
introduced in when netflix first launched the dvd service promised an easier rental experience than having to drive to the nearest blockbuster or hollywood video
the red envelopes which have long been synonymous with netflix itself littered homes and dorm rooms across the country
although the idea of receiving a dvd in the mail now may sound almost as outdated as dial up internet some longtime customers told cnn they continued to find value in the dvd option
colin mcevoy a father of two from bethlehem pennsylvania and a self described film fanatic said he rushed through movies in the last few weeks to get through the remainder of his queue before the service ends
mcevoy has remained faithful to netflix s dvd service so he can keep watching bollywood and obscure independent films not often found on streaming services
i was basically watching them as soon as i got them and then returning the discs as quickly as possible to get as many as i could said mcevoy who has been using netflix s dvd by mail service since just three years after it launched
i remember i was in high school when i first signed up for it and the concept was so novel i had to really convince my dad that it was a legit service and not some sort of internet scam said mcevoy who uses an old xbox to play his netflix dvds
now i have friends who ve seen my red netflix envelopes arrive in the mail and either didn t remember what they were or couldn t believe that i still got the dvds in the mail
some other netflix users stood by its dvd service not only for the selection but for added perks
brandon cordy a year old graphic designer from atlanta previously told cnn he stuck with dvds because many digital rentals don t come with special features or audio commentaries
there are other factors too
michael inouye an analyst at abi research said some consumers may still not have access to reliable or fast enough broadband connections or simply prefer physical media to digital much in the way that some audio enthusiasts still purchase and collect cds and records
for netflix however the offering has made less sense in recent years
our goal has always been to provide the best service for our members but as the dvd business continues to shrink that s going to become increasingly difficult co ceo ted sarandos wrote in a blog post in april
shutting down its dvd business could help netflix better focus resources as it expands into new markets such as gaming as well as live and interactive content
its dvd business has also declined significantly in recent years
in netflix s non streaming revenue mostly attributable to dvds amounted to of its revenue or just over million
the cost to operate its dvd business may also be a factor especially as netflix rethinks expenses broadly amid heightened streaming competition and broader economic uncertainty
moving plastic discs around costs far more money than streaming digital bits said eric schmitt senior director analyst at gartner research
removing and replacing damaged and lost inventory are also cost considerations
even before netflix announced the news some longtime subscribers said they could see the writing on the wall
the inventory of available titles while still vast had been contracting some over the years with some movies that were once available no longer being so cordy said
turnaround times to get a new movie or movies also started to take longer so i knew it was only a matter of time
but i didn t want it to end if i could help it
other dvd subscribers were hoping for a happy ending
bill rouhana the ceo of chicken soup for the soul entertainment which owns dvd rental service redbox told the hollywood reporter in april he hoped to purchase netflix s dvd business
i d like to buy it i wish netflix would sell me that business instead of shutting it down he said
redbox remains popular despite the shift in streaming but took a hit during the pandemic because of the lack of new movies and tv shows to fill the boxes
a netflix spokesperson told cnn it has no plans to sell the dvd business and will be recycling the majority of its dvds through third party companies that specialize in recycling digital and electronic media
it will also donate some of its inventory to organizations focused on film and media
netflix is also offering subscribers a finale surprise where they could opt in to receive up to dvds selected at random from their queue
mcevoy who already subscribes to disney hulu the criterion channel and mubi said he s now testing out other services such as eros indian cinema and viki korean and chinese films for harder to find content
still he said he s sad to see netflix s dvd service depart
i absolutely would not have been able to find all of those movies i ve watched if not for the netflix dvd service he said
