the us government is planning to change auto emissions standards in a way that means automakers would need to sell a lot more electric vehicles
by electric vehicles would need to make up about two thirds of all the new cars sold in america
without these requirements electric vehicles would have reached that sort of market share sometime after according to moody s industry analyst matthias heck
the goals laid out by the epa are manageable he said but it won t be easy and high levels of investment would be needed
for now the proposal is still just that a proposal and could well change before before being finalized heck pointed out
over the next decade things will change a lot including charging infrastructure and the vehicles themselves
consumers will be drawn to electric vehicles more as battery technology improves and prices drop
and government incentives like those under the new inflation reduction act will help too
the big electric kia ev has carpets made out of recycled fishing nets
it s important to remember that nearly a decade from now electric vehicles are going to be different from what s on the market today said chris harto a policy analyst for transportation and energy at consumer reports
and even as ev market share rises to two thirds it s not like evs will flood america s roads overnight he said
eighty percent of the cars on the roads in will still be gas powered he said but shopping for a new vehicle will be different
we re talking about past cost parity so it s going to be the same price or cheaper compared to a gas powered car he said
at the same time driving ranges will increase fast charging will be easier and more accessible and owners will enjoy greatly reduced operating costs harto said
moody s heck predicted that next generation ev batteries expected in the next few years will go further on a charge and will recharge faster
so when combined with improved charging networks something else that can be expected over that time electric cars won t be a particularly hard sell for consumers who are just looking for the best vehicle at a good price harto said
there will also be more electric vehicle models available by
today there are ev equivalents available for roughly of the gas vehicle models americans can buy according to elizabeth krear vice president of the electric vehicle practice at jd power
electric market share now stands at
krear did not specifically comment on the chances of evs making up two thirds of the us auto market by
but by just three years from now krear expects there will be ev equivalents for of the vehicles americans shop for and market share will have already tripled to
in california where evs are more popular and there are more models available ev market share is already expected to reach the two thirds mark before
eu was set to ban internal combustion engine cars
then germany suddenly changed its mind
california plans to allow the sale of only fully electric and plug in hybrid vehicles by a goal it s on the way to meeting according to corey cantor an analyst with bloomberg nef
so california should be at over market share for plug in vehicles including plug in hybrids by and california itself through its sheer size is a big factor in the overall us vehicle market
california s influence on the whole country is really bringing it forward to maybe a year sooner than where it would be without california he said
reaching two thirds ev market share mark by isn t a sure thing said cantor but it should be manageable
the increasing number of automakers entering the ev market will also help said ivan drury an industry analyst with edmunds com
many car buyers tend to be very loyal to their preferred vehicle brand
not everyone is willing to jump ship just because it s an ev or it has x y z piece of technology said drury
i think that when you have something like toyota definitely a loyal consumer base they don t want anything other than toyotas
currently toyota offers only one electric model in the united states the bz x suv but more are planned
honda another japanese brand with a loyal following offers no evs currently but the company is gearing up factories in ohio to build future ev models
honda expects to offer its first ev next year
general motors also has a number of ev models coming in the next year or two
electric cars don t need better batteries
america needs better charging networks
gm on its own will provide a good test of the american market s readiness for evs in the next couple of years said drury
that automaker which has pledged to offer nothing but electric passenger vehicles by will begin selling models in a range of market segments and price points
the alliance for automotive innovation an industry group that includes most major automakers operating in the country posted a statement on its website expressing caution about the goals and asking for cooperation from various government agencies
a lot has to go right for this massive and unprecedented change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed the group wrote in its statement
at some point various automakers that may have been slower than gm to embrace electric will simply have to make the switch for economic reasons said cantor
once consumers start broadly embracing evs continuing to invest in the development and production of internal combustion vehicles just won t make economic sense any longer
