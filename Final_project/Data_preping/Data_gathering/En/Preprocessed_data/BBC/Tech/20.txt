today was the day for the us government s big emergency alert drill which sent a test message to every tv radio and cell phone in the nation
starting at approximately pm et on wednesday the federal government began conducting a nationwide test of its emergency alert system and wireless emergency alerts
the eas portion of the test sent an emergency alert to all radios and televisions while the wea portion of the drill sent an alert to all consumer cell phones
the test was being conducted by the federal emergency management agency in coordination with the federal communication commission
its purpose was to ensure that the systems in place continue to be an effective means of warning the public about emergencies at a national level
essentially what this means is that hundreds of millions of cell phones around the country made a screeching alert noise at approximately the same time today beginning around pm et
radio and tv stations also blared a test alert at around the same time
but there was no action required from you after receiving the free message it was just a test
here are answers to all of your burning questions about today s emergency alert test
while some recent models of mobile phones may include a setting to opt out of tests and alerts none of these settings will affect the national test fema has said
that means if your mobile phone was on and receiving service from a participating wireless provider you will likely received the national wireless emergency alert test the agency added
there are however three conditions which would prevent the cell phone alert from getting delivered to a device
if your phone is turned off has airplane mode switched on or is not connected or associated with a cell tower then it did not receive the message
survivors of domestic violence and people in abusive relationships often have a secret or emergency phone that they don t want their partner or others to know about
on a call with reporters tuesday a senior fema official said the agency was aware of these concerns stemming from survivors of domestic violence and their allies
the official recommended that people who do not want a secret phone to be revealed to turn their phone completely off ahead of the pm et test and not to turn it back on for thirty minutes or until after pm et
if you wanted to be cautious you could also wait until you are in a safe place before turning your phone back on
educators are braced themselves for some disruption this afternoon as the test impacting cell phones occurred during school hours for most of the country
on the call with reporters the senior fema official recommended that educators as much as possible try to use this as a teaching opportunity about federal emergency management and preparedness initiatives
the national test cannot be used to monitor locate or lock your phone fema has said
the test is also using broadcast technology and does not collect any of your data
all cell phones should have received an alert and an accompanying text message that reads this is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system
no action is needed
the free text message was sent in either english or spanish depending on the language settings of your device
the text was accompanied by a unique tone and vibration that is meant to make the alert accessible to the entire public including people with disabilities fema has said
the test was broadcast by cell towers for approximately minutes beginning at pm et fema said
during this time all compatible wireless phones that were switched on within range of an active cell tower and whose wireless providers participates in wea tests should have received the text message
although the test will be transmitting for approximately minutes you should only have received the alert message once
meanwhile all radios and televisions also broadcast a test emergency alert at the same time as part of the broader test
this message which ran for approximately one minute stated this is a nationwide test of the emergency alert system issued by the federal emergency management agency covering the united states from to hours et
this is only a test
no action is required by the public
in short no
there are a number of false claims circulating online with regard to the test alert including some conspiracy theories that incorrectly allege the sound emitted as part of the national test can impact your body at the cellular level
this is false
fema is not aware of any adverse health effects caused by the audio signal the agency has stated
and while this is a national test it uses the same technology and infrastructure that state and local authorities rely on to send localized amber alerts or extreme weather warnings a senior fema official emphasized to reporters on tuesday
in a frequently asked question sheet released by fema ahead of wednesday s test the agency stated the audio signal that will be used in the national test is the same combination of audio tones that has been used since in the original emergency broadcast system
if you have a mobile phone that was switched on not on airplane mode within range of an active cell tower and on a network where wireless providers participate in wireless emergency alerts then you should have received the test message on wednesday afternoon by pm et
if you are trying to figure out why you did not receive an alert when you should have or have any other feedback on the test members of the public can write to the email address fema national test fema dhs gov
