new study suggests people taking popular injected medication weight loss including wegovy ozempic saxenda victoza may higher risk serious digestive problem stomach paralysis pancreatitis bowel obstruction compared taking type weight loss medications
study found risk event happening individual patient appears rare people taking ozempic diagnosed stomach paralysis example demand drug ha exploded ten million taking worldwide researcher say even rare risk like may amount hundred thousand new cases
million people using drug know risk still translates many people may experience event said lead study author dr
study author also note problem mild bowel obstruction example medical emergencies
previous cnn reporting highlighted case stomach paralysis people taken drug lack warning specific side effect patients
prescribing information wegovy saxenda doe caution host serious side effect including inflammation pancreas gallbladder problem blocked intestine kidney problem serious allergic reaction increased heart rate suicidal thought change vision people also diabetes
warning ileus blocked intestine wa also added ozempics warning label
label also note common side effect nasuea vomiting constipation
also strongly warn people history certain type hereditary thyroid cancer taking medications
fda update ozempic label acknowledge user report blocked intestines
study published research letter jama researcher university british columbia sifted random sample million insurance claim prescription drug database cover outpatient prescription u claim filed and
looked patient prescribed two injected drug semaglutide liraglutide
drug belong class called glp- agonist slow passage food stomach
help people diabetes control blood sugar lead substantial weight loss people without diabetes
u food drug administration approved semaglutide people obese without diabetes need lose weight sold brand name ozempic prescribed diabetes wegovy prescribed weight loss liraglutide wa fda approved weight loss medicine since prescribed diabetes called victoza prescribed weight management called saxenda
even drug officially hit market weight loss doctor noticed benefit began prescribing off-label patient needed shed pounds
ferret patient might researcher looked people diagnosed obesity least day started medication excluded also diagnosed diabetes taking drug control blood sugar
compared frequency serious digestive problem patient set problem people taking different type medication weight loss bupropion-naltrexone sold pill called contrave
cnn exclusive prescription popular diabetes weight-loss drug soared access limited patients
year reviewed researcher found people taking ozempic saxenda much likely develop serious stomach intestinal problem compared taking contrave
absolute term wa roughly rate new case stomach paralysis group taking ozempic incidence stomach paralysis group taking saxenda roughly incidence stomach paralysis group taking contrave
relative term mean people taking injected drug three time likely develop stomach paralysis compared taking contrave
bowel obstruction noted group taking ozempic study found incidence people taking saxenda incidence people taking contrave mean bowel obstruction four time likely people taking injected medication compared contrave
pancreatitis wa incidence pancreatitis people taking ozempic risk people taking saxenda incidence people taking contrave representing ninefold increase
researcher also looked risk patient might diagnosed biliary disease cluster problem affecting gallbladder bile duct significant difference groups
group roughly patient taking ozempic four case gastroparesis stomach paralysis two case pancreatitis bowel obstruction five developed biliary disease
group people taking saxenda case stomach paralysis bowel obstruction case pancreatitis case biliary disease
group people taking contrave contrast three case stomach paralysis two bowel obstruction one case pancreatitis case biliary disease
observational show association cant prove drug caused condition people diagnosed with
researcher say tried control thing may biased results
people diabetes example already increased risk gastroparesis increased risk pancreatitis biliary disease say study author mohit sodhi medical student studying adverse event commonly prescribed medication excluding study sodhi said able tease carefully might linked drug versus disease
though researcher took step try find people might using drug weight loss noted medical record way know sure thats taking it
still first time researcher able put number risk previously described doctor patient noticed them
expert involved study said wa well conducted ha limit wont final word
glp- agonist generally well tolerated low incidence serious side effect said dr
ian musgrave molecular pharmacologist university adelaide australia statement study given non-profit science medium centre uk
example musgrave said inflammation pancreas pancreatitis known side effect agent patient type- diabetes
whats le clear whether patient taking drug weight loss may serious side effects
one thing may affect study finding musgrave said many patient taking injected drug taking contrave
another may study author controlled data thing like age sex alcohol use smoking high cholesterol didnt compare effect body mass index bmi
still said study finding valuable contribution doctor prescribing drug patient considering taking them
novo nordisk manufacturer ozempic saxenda said stand behind safety efficacy glp- medication used consistent product labeling approved indications
respect study author acknowledge study ha limitation including potential confounding indication factor company said statement cnn
recommend patient take medication approved indication supervision healthcare professional
treatment decision made together healthcare provider evaluate appropriateness using glp- based assessment patient individual medical profile statement said
ozempic wegovy maker scratching surface meeting demand weight loss drug ceo says
researcher note problem probably didnt show clinical trial led dug approval study werent large enough capture rarer adverse event study recorded event symptom rather delving underlying causes
main symptom gastroparesis nausea vomiting may report nausea vomiting know looking true etiology whats happening something consider sodhi said
sodhi said wa motivated study treating man emergency department wa vomiting time day doctor couldnt figure wa causing noticed wa taking ozempic
sodhi said started man medication treat stomach paralysis got lot better sodhi said
meantime researcher hope regulatory agency drug maker consider updating warning label product currently dont include risk gastroparesis
critical information patient know seek timely medical attention avoid serious consequence said sodhi
hope study give people make informed decision drugs
someone ha diabetes taking medication might willing accept risk adverse event rare help get diabetes control sodhi said
people otherwise healthy may want lose bit weight know better idea essentially might getting could potentially change whether take medications
side coin obesity come substantial risk also considered said dr
