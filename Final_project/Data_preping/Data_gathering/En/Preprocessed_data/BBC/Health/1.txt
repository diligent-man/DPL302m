a new study suggests people taking popular injected medications for weight loss including wegovy ozempic saxenda and victoza may be at higher risk for serious digestive problems such as stomach paralysis pancreatitis and bowel obstructions compared with those taking other types of weight loss medications
the study found risks of these events happening to individual patients appears to be rare about of people taking ozempic were diagnosed with stomach paralysis for example but demand for the drugs has exploded with tens of millions now taking them worldwide researchers say even rare risks like these may amount to hundreds of thousands of new cases
when you have millions of people using these drugs you know a risk still translates to many people who may experience these events said lead study author dr
mahyar etminan an epidemiologist at the university of british columbia
the study authors also note that these problems are not mild bowel obstructions for example can be medical emergencies
previous cnn reporting highlighted cases of stomach paralysis in people who had taken these drugs and the lack of warning about that specific side effect to patients
the prescribing information for wegovy and saxenda does caution about a host of serious side effects including inflammation of the pancreas gallbladder problems blocked intestines kidney problems serious allergic reactions increased heart rate suicidal thoughts and changes in vision or people who also have diabetes
a warning about ileus or blocked intestines was also just added to ozempic s warning label
the labels also note the most common side effects are nasuea vomiting and constipation
they also strongly warn people with a history of certain types of hereditary thyroid cancers against taking the medications
fda updates ozempic label to acknowledge some users reports of blocked intestines
for the study which published as a research letter in jama researchers at the university of british columbia sifted through a random sample of more than million insurance claims from a prescription drug database that covers about of all outpatient prescriptions in the us the claims were filed between and
they looked for patients who were prescribed two injected drugs semaglutide and liraglutide
both drugs belong to a class called glp agonists and slow the passage of food through the stomach
they can help people with diabetes control their blood sugar and lead to substantial weight loss for people with or without diabetes
in the us food and drug administration approved semaglutide for people who are obese without diabetes who only need to lose weight it s sold under the brand name ozempic when prescribed for diabetes and wegovy when prescribed for weight loss liraglutide was fda approved as a weight loss medicine since when it s prescribed for diabetes it s called victoza when prescribed for weight management it s called saxenda
but even before the drugs officially hit the market for weight loss doctors had noticed the benefits and began prescribing off label for patients who needed to shed pounds
to ferret out who those patients might have been researchers looked for people who were diagnosed with obesity at least days before they started the medication and excluded any who were also diagnosed with diabetes or who were taking any other drug to control their blood sugar
then they compared the frequency of serious digestive problems in those patients to the same set of problems in people taking a different type of medication for weight loss bupropion naltrexone which is sold as pill called contrave
cnn exclusive prescriptions for popular diabetes and weight loss drugs soared but access is limited for some patients
over the years reviewed the researchers found that people taking ozempic and saxenda were much more likely to develop serious stomach and intestinal problems compared with those who were taking contrave
in absolute terms there was a roughly rate of new cases of stomach paralysis in the group taking ozempic about incidence of stomach paralysis in the group taking saxenda and a roughly incidence of stomach paralysis in the group taking contrave
in relative terms that means people taking the injected drugs were more than three times more likely to develop stomach paralysis compared with those taking contrave
there were no bowel obstructions noted in the group taking ozempic but the study found a incidence in people who were taking saxenda and a incidence in people taking contrave that means bowel obstructions were more than four times more likely in people taking the injected medications compared with those on contrave
for pancreatitis there was a incidence of pancreatitis in people taking ozempic a risk in people taking saxenda and a incidence in people taking contrave representing a more than ninefold increase
researchers also looked at the risk that patients might be diagnosed with biliary disease which is a cluster of problems affecting the gallbladder and bile ducts but there were no significant differences between the groups
in the group of roughly patients who were taking ozempic there were four cases of gastroparesis or stomach paralysis two cases of pancreatitis no bowel obstructions and five who developed biliary disease
in the group of about people taking saxenda there were cases of stomach paralysis bowel obstructions cases of pancreatitis and cases of biliary disease
in the group of about people taking contrave by contrast there were three cases of stomach paralysis two bowel obstructions one case of pancreatitis and cases of biliary disease
they took blockbuster drugs for weight loss and diabetes
now their stomachs are paralyzed
the study has limits
it is observational so it can only show associations it can t prove the drugs caused the conditions people were diagnosed with
but researchers say they tried to control for some of the things that may have biased their results
people with diabetes for example they already have an increased risk of gastroparesis they have an increased risk of pancreatitis and biliary disease says study author mohit sodhi a medical student who is studying the adverse events of commonly prescribed medications by excluding them from the study sodhi said they were able to tease out more carefully what might be linked to the drug versus the disease
and though researchers took steps to try to find people who might have been using the drugs for weight loss because it s not noted in their medical records there s no way to know for sure that s why they were taking it
still this is the first time researchers have been able to put numbers to these risks which have previously only been described by doctors and patients who have noticed them
experts who were not involved in the study said it was well conducted but has some limits and won t be the final word
while glp agonists are generally well tolerated there is a low incidence of serious side effects said dr
ian musgrave a molecular pharmacologist at the university of adelaide in australia in a statement on the study given to the non profit science media centre in the uk
for example musgrave said inflammation of the pancreas or pancreatitis is a known side effect of these agents in patients with type diabetes
what s been less clear is whether patients taking these drugs for weight loss may have the same serious side effects
one thing that may affect the study findings musgrave said is that there were many more patients taking the injected drugs than were taking contrave
another may be that while the study authors controlled their data for things like age sex alcohol use smoking and high cholesterol they didn t compare the effect of body mass index or bmi
still he said the study findings are a valuable contribution to doctors who are prescribing the drugs and patients who are considering taking them
novo nordisk the manufacturer of both ozempic and saxenda said it stands behind the safety and efficacy of all its glp medications when used consistent with the product labeling and approved indications
with respect to the study as the authors acknowledge the study has limitations including potential confounding by indication and by other factors the company said in a statement to cnn
we recommend patients take these medications for their approved indications and under the supervision of a healthcare professional
treatment decisions should be made together with a healthcare provider who can evaluate the appropriateness of using a glp based on assessment of a patient s individual medical profile the statement said
ozempic and wegovy maker just scratching the surface in meeting demand for weight loss drugs ceo says
the researchers note that these problems probably didn t show up in the clinical trials that led to the dugs approval because those studies weren t large enough to capture some of these rarer adverse events or the studies recorded these events as symptoms rather than delving their underlying causes
the main symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea and vomiting so they may report nausea and vomiting but you know looking at the true etiology of what s happening is something to consider sodhi said
sodhi said he was motivated to do the study after treating a man in the emergency department who was vomiting to times a day doctors couldn t figure out what was causing it until they noticed he was taking ozempic
sodhi said they started the man on a medication that treats stomach paralysis and he got a lot better sodhi said
it s entirely possible that he had this type of adverse event he said
in the meantime the researchers hope that regulatory agencies and drug makers will consider updating the warning labels for their products which currently don t include the risk of gastroparesis

sanjay gupta every tuesday from the cnn health team
this is critical information for patients to know so they can seek timely medical attention and avoid serious consequences said sodhi
and they hope their study will give people make more informed decisions about the drugs
someone who has diabetes and is taking this medication for that might be more willing to accept the risk of these adverse events which are rare to help get their diabetes under control sodhi said
but people who are otherwise healthy but may want to lose a bit of weight you know if they had a better idea essentially of what they might be getting into that could potentially change whether or not they take these medications
on the other side of the coin obesity comes with its own substantial risks that also have to be considered said dr
simon cork a senior lecturer in physiology at anglia ruskin university in the uk
cork was not involved in the study and reported no conflicts of interest related to the drugs
obesity significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease type diabetes cancer gallbladder disease and stroke these risks fall dramatically with clinically meaningful and sustained weight loss said cork in a statement given to the nonprofit science media centre for the overwhelming majority of patients for whom these drugs are targeted those with the most severe forms of obesity the benefits of weight loss far outweigh the risks
