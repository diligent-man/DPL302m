health care providers should consider prescribing a commonly used antibiotic to certain people as a way to prevent chlamydia gonorrhea and syphilis infections according to a draft recommendation posted online by the us centers for disease control and prevention on monday
the purpose of the proposed guidelines is to provide updated clinical guidance for healthcare providers to inform the use of doxycycline pep for preventing bacterial sti infections according to the posted document
the proposed guidelines for the method called doxypep apply only to men who have sex with men and transgender women
the cdc is seeking public comment on the proposal from interested persons and organizations now until november
a trial is underway that could be the last roll of the dice for an hiv vaccine this decade
jonathan mermin director of cdc s national center for hiv viral hepatitis std and tb prevention previously said in an email to cnn that the agency would seek public comment because it allows us to gather important input before finalizing guidance and gives clinical providers people affected by stis and partner organizations the opportunity to weigh in before our guidance is finalized
the agency did not say when final guidelines are expected
doxycycline is a class of medications typically used to treat bacterial stis after someone has been infected a method called post exposure prophylaxis
however recent research suggests that one mg dose of the drug also may be effective in preventing such infections among men who have sex with men if taken within hours after unprotected sex
until the cdc issues formal guidance on the use of doxycycline doxypep will remain available as an off label prescription when used for sti prevention
the us food and drug administration has not officially approved the medication for sti post exposure prophylaxis

at the end of the study the researchers found that every quarter or about every three months the combined incidence of gonorrhea chlamydia and syphilis was lower by two thirds among those who took doxypep within hours after having sex without a condom than in those with standard care
this is not a new concept the concept of post exposure prophylaxis
we use it for a number of other infectious diseases like lyme disease
if someone s been bitten by a tick and there s concern that they might have been exposed to lyme disease they can be given a single dose of doxycycline dr
annie luetkemeyer professor of infectious diseases at zuckerberg san francisco general hospital at ucsf and co principal investigator of the study said in august
some local health departments already have their own recommendations for the use of doxypep to prevent stis
the san francisco department of public health released doxypep guidance in october
in april the california department of public health released similar guidance for health care providers recommending doxypep to men who have sex with men or transgender women who have had at least one bacterial sti in the past months
