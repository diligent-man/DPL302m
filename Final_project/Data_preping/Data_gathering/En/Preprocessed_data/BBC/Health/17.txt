a sign greets visitors arriving at a sun filled two story house in el salvador s capital
you must enter smiling it says
before you come in you will find an invisible bag where you can leave your sorrows
when you leave you can decide whether to take them with you
teodora v squez knows the women seeking shelter support or a fresh start here often have decades of sorrows weighing on them
and she s propped up this sign beside a green plastic turtle near the front door as a first step toward the healing she hopes they ll start to find within these walls
it s been years since el salvador made abortion illegal in all circumstances eliminating any exceptions
and it s been nearly as long since lawmakers passed a constitutional amendment declaring that life begins at conception
v squez was among more than women who advocates say were unjustly convicted of crimes after suffering obstetric emergencies including miscarriages and stillbirths in the years since the revised penal code and constitutional amendment went into effect
activists warn that these women s experiences show how dangerously far criminalizing abortion can go
v squez was convicted of aggravated homicide and imprisoned for more than years before el salvador s supreme court commuted her year sentence in
the overcrowded ilopango women s prison where she lived for over a decade seems like a world away from the airy garden courtyard v squez points out as she gives a tour of her home via zoom
but she says the experiences she endured behind bars and how important it is to help others who ve gone through the same thing are never far from her mind
this house isn t just where v squez lives
it s also the headquarters of mujeres libres el salvador an organization she founded
the group s name means free women in spanish
and legally speaking that s exactly what v squez and the four other people who live here are
so too are the dozens of other women who ve traveled hours to spend their weekends attending workshops here
like v squez in the last few years courts have ordered their release from prison
but since then there s another kind of freedom that s been harder to come by
we ve been living through a double conviction
first the one the judge gave us v squez says then the one society gave us
and we call that a life sentence
because from the moment you entered prison for your entire life you are going to have this
you are going to die and they are going to remember you because you were a prisoner
in recent years the cases of v squez and other women have spurred global protests appeals from the un s top human rights official and attention from hollywood stars
but as recently as salvadoran lawmakers voted to uphold the country s abortion prohibitions
and within the socially conservative country the ban is popular among many catholic and evangelical salvadorans
that v squez says is one reason why she and other women keep retelling the stories they wish they could forget
now as part of mujeres libres v squez says they aren t just trying to heal themselves
they have a much larger goal too
we want to make sure our history doesn t repeat itself in future generations she says
the sharp pain hit v squez suddenly at the school caf where she worked in july
she was nine months pregnant at the time
she already had a young son and v squez says she was looking forward to giving birth to a baby girl
i wanted my daughter
i had bought clothes for her v squez says
as the pain intensified she called multiple times asking for help
v squez says the help she needed never came
she says she fainted in a bathroom and was unconscious when she gave birth
when she regained consciousness she was bleeding profusely and the baby was dead amnesty international said in a summary of her case
when police finally arrived they took her into custody
v squez says that initially she like others was accused of having an abortion
then they changed the classification to aggravated homicide she says
that means that to the salvadoran state our children were born alive and we killed them
in january she was sentenced to years in prison
v squez s case and others like it caught the attention of jocelyn viterna a professor of sociology and chair of studies of women gender and sexuality at harvard university who has spent decades studying the impact of abortion restrictions in el salvador
once you start looking into these cases the extreme injustice jumps off the page viterna says
these women had not done anything to break the law and yet at every step the legal system was set up to prosecute them
many cases viterna says involve impoverished women who were alone when they went into labor and whose babies were either stillborn or died shortly after birth due to circumstances beyond their control
subsequent autopsies viterna says often relied on the so called lung float test a controversial method for investigating allegations of infanticide that dates back to the th century and has been discredited by many medical experts
advocates in the united states warn that the salvadoran women s cases are a telling example of the kinds of prosecutions they fear will intensify in the wake of last year s supreme court ruling overturning the federal constitutional right to an abortion
that is just so dangerous says dana sussman deputy executive director of pregnancy justice a new york based organization that defends people in the us facing criminal charges for pregnancy outcomes
the idea that you could use forensics that are pseudoscience to convict women in these tragic cases is really really concerning
it took time for the women to find each other inside the prison where many of them were held
the crime they were convicted of killing their babies carried such a stigma that they dared not mention it aloud
those who did were beaten by fellow inmates
we were already friends but nobody was talking about our cases v squez says in fly so far a documentary that follows her story
it was only after a group of human rights lawyers met with them together that they realized the connections their cases shared
as advocacy groups mounted protests calling for their freedom the documentary details how the group of detained women nominated v squez to be their spokesperson
and as she fought for own conviction to be overturned she also spoke out about the others plight
i have rarely been as moved as i was by their stories and the cruelty they have endured then un high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al hussein said after meeting v squez and several other women in
it only seems to be women from poor and humble backgrounds who are jailed a telling feature of the injustice suffered
the un official called for authorities to review the cases
but within el salvador a largely catholic and evangelical christian country some viewed the women s accounts with skepticism and hostility
as international pressure mounted the then head of el salvador s institute of legal medicine told reporters that the women who became widely known as the were in prison because they were accused of infanticide not obstetric emergencies or abortions a point he reiterated in a recent interview with cnn
jos miguel fort n maga a a psychiatrist who resigned from his post directing the institute in says he stands by the scientific analysis in autopsies his staff conducted
critiques of the testing used he says fail to take into account that additional analysis was done
these cases became emblematic because it got political
and when something becomes political the truth is no longer sought after he told cnn
a month after v squez met with the un s top human rights official in an appeals court in el salvador upheld her conviction
again the un s human rights office weighed in calling el salvador s laws draconian
two months later justices from el salvador s supreme court commuted v squez s sentence saying evidence in the case did not prove that she had taken any action to end her baby s life
she was released in february after more than years behind bars
a crowd of cheering supporters awaited her outside the prison gates
her parents and her then teenage son stood among them waiting to embrace her
but even after winning her hard fought release finding true freedom was harder than she expected
v squez only had a third grade education when she entered prison
during her years behind bars she devoted herself to education earning her high school diploma
but she says she quickly realized the years of classes she d taken in prison weren t enough to help her find her footing once she was released
i didn t even know how to use a computer she says
v squez signed up for a computer course and enrolled in college soon afterward
but she says she still found it hard to reenter society
i started to think if i m dealing with this how are the women who were released before me v squez says
what have they done to make it
v squez started searching for them to find out
months after her release from prison she brought together women and began interviewing them about their experiences
she was surprised to learn that many were struggling even years after their release
some were shunned by their families
many couldn t find jobs because of their criminal records
they started to tell me about very difficult situations and some of these women had already been out of prison for eight years
and i said to myself let s do something
let s change this reality not just for us but for all the other women who are going to come out of prison v squez recalls
and from there she says the idea of mujeres libres was born
as she walks the halls of the group s headquarters in san salvador and shows the space to cnn during a zoom interview v squez points proudly to rooms with bright blue bunk beds
for some who are originally from more rural parts of the country the house is a temporary stopping point when they re in town for appointments
for others it s a place to live so they can work in the city where jobs are more plentiful
during the week the house is quiet and calm but on weekends v squez says it s a hive of activity
women travel hours from different parts of the country for counseling sessions and workshops on topics like playwriting and women s rights
with each passing year the number of potential members seems to grow
since more than women who were prosecuted after suffering obstetric emergencies have been released according to the citizen group for the decriminalization of abortion in el salvador
i ve been learning to open up says year old jacqueline castillo who says she was wrongfully convicted of attempted homicide after her baby was born in a latrine during an obstetric emergency
it s helped me be able to let go of some things
castillo who was released from prison last year after serving more than years of her year sentence says she s been taking computer classes at the mujeres libres house and also gaining confidence to start making plans for her future
she s a domestic worker now but hopes one day to start her own restaurant
it s very beautiful because you can let go of things and concentrate and then you now have something else in your mind something positive she says
you can learn something and then you can share it with someone else
jocelyn viterna points at an anatomy chart on her computer screen as v squez and other members of mujeres libres look on
the harvard professor has been studying these women s cases and the impact of el salvador s abortion restrictions for years
but on wednesday evenings this fall she s serving in another role their teacher
at the request of v squez and other members of mujeres libres viterna is leading a weekly zoom course about gender sexuality and reproductive health
today s lessons the anatomy of the female sexual and reproductive system followed by explanations of how this anatomy connects with sexual pleasure
what do you think viterna asks the class as she concludes her presentation
why do you think so many people see it as shameful to talk about this
v squez is the first to raise her hand with an answer
i think it has a lot to do with our culture and what our parents teach us she says
today v squez and the other women are students
but soon they hope to be teaching these kinds of lessons too as they travel around the country and speak with salvadoran youth in a series of presentations scheduled to begin next month
we have to start educating the population because that is how people are sensitized and how they take action and we get rid of ignorance
and that is how things will change
teodora v squez president of mujeres libres el salvador
the group plans to screen the documentary about their experiences perform a play and lead discussion sessions
v squez says she s already seen signs of a shift in el salvador
fewer women who have obstetric emergencies are being prosecuted she says after a inter american court of human rights ruling ordered the government to grant professional secrecy protections to doctors
that change means doctors are no longer required to report possible abortion attempts
human rights groups had argued that medical personnel previously felt pressured to report patients fearing that they would be charged or sanctioned themselves
advocates also hope another case pending before the court could clear the way for legalizing abortion in some instances in el salvador and other latin american countries that criminalize it
but even if el salvador s laws change tomorrow v squez says there s still more work to do
she sees a clear connection between the rarity of lessons like the ones viterna is teaching them and the decisions that sent her and so many others to prison
we have to start educating the population because that is how people are sensitized and how they take action and we get rid of ignorance she says
and that is how things will change
v squez knows not everyone will welcome their message
last year she says anti abortion protesters tried to block screenings of the documentary about the group
the protest campaign spurred a flood of threats after her contact information was leaked online she says
they kept saying they were going to report me so that i would shut up v squez says
but v squez says she s determined to keep speaking out
why spend so much time talking about a painful part of her past and why take the risks more public exposure could bring
we aren t doing this for ourselves v squez says
what more can happen to us we already went to prison
we already paid for crimes that we didn t commit
we are here but sincerely we are doing this because we want at least the youth of future generations to have better lives
as part of this year s upcoming speaking tour the group will be performing a play they ve written dispelling myths around menstruation
v squez is excited to see how audiences respond
she s already seen first hand how transformative taking the stage can be
last year they put on another play mujeres de acero spanish for women of steel v squez tears up whenever she watches a video of the performance which ends with the women waving scarves to mimic butterflies wings fluttering as they circle the stage
she and the other women she says have found strength in each other and made a space for themselves
that v squez says is true freedom the kind that no one can take away
