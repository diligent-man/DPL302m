it s fair to say spain was late to the table when it came to recognizing the global superpowers of food
while italy and france have spent years in the limelight spain was biding its time
in recent years however people have come to celebrate the extraordinary flavors and variety of produce the cuisine has to offer
high profile chefs such as ferran adri mastermind of the now closed el bulli restaurant and the roca brothers founders of the el celler de can roca have brought spain s alta cocina international acclaim
and in spain had more restaurants on the world s best list than any other country
but the heart of spanish cooking remains in its rustic homespun nature a legacy of a time when hard pressed spaniards had to work the land for everything it would offer
these dishes from seafood and meat to rice and pastries are essential to sample when you travel to spain
paella is perhaps the most famous spanish dish of all and certainly one of the most abused
authentic paella originates from the region around valencia and comes in two varieties paella valenciana with rabbit and chicken and seafood paella
saffron gives the rice its color and the base should be left to crisp into a mouth watering black crust called the socarrat
spaniards only eat it at lunchtime
a staple among the small dishes that make up a classic tapas menu patatas bravas brave potatoes is named for its spicy sauce rare in a land that generally shuns fiery food
the potatoes are cubed and shallow fried and served the same everywhere
the sauce can come in any number of ways from spicy ketchup to garlic mayonnaise with a dusting of pimiento smoked paprika or both
one theory holds that the dirtier the bar the better the bravas
this tomato based andalusian soup is most famous for being served cold
this can be quite a shock for those who aren t expecting it but in the searing heat of a seville summer the attraction becomes clear
its principal ingredients aside from tomato are peppers garlic bread and lots of olive oil
a common dish on tapas menus pimientos de padr n are green peppers that hail originally from the town of that name in galicia in spain s lush rainy northwest
pimientos de padr n are fried in olive oil and served with a deep sprinkling of salt
though generally sweet and mild their fame stems from the fact that the occasional pepper will be fiery hot lending a russian roulette element of surprise to eating them
less well known to tourists fideu is a type of spanish pasta similar to vermicelli
it s popular in catalonia and valencia in seafood dishes that rival paella for their taste and intricacy
fideu is typically cooked in a paella dish
jam n or cured ham is the most celebrated spanish food product
legs of ham were traditionally salted and hung up to dry to preserve them through the long winter months
jam n serrano of the mountain is the most common kind and comes from white pigs the more expensive jam n iberico pictured comes from black pigs
the best ham should be enjoyed in thin melt in your mouth slices on its own with a little bread
jam n is the staple of the spanish table says chef jos pizarro the brains behind jos tapas bar pizarro and jos pizarro restaurants in london and a handful of other eateries
we eat it before we eat its salty acorn laden taste is the perfect accompaniment to sherry and cava and it gets your juices flowing for the meal that is yet to come
it s brilliantly good value and a leg can last ages as long as you cover and store it properly
look for waxy fat when you rub it it should melt into your skin like candle wax
the humble spanish omelet can be made with chorizo peppers and onions among other ingredients but purists will tell you it should only contain potatoes and eggs
the potatoes are diced and lightly fried before being added to the egg mixture and fried on a high heat the trickiest part is when you have to flip the pan over to turn the tortilla
if you get it right someone should shout ol get it wrong and you ll have gooey half cooked tortilla everywhere
churros are a popular snack made from fried dough cut into sausage shapes and doused in sugar
they re a favorite at fiestas or street parties when they re sold by roadside vendors
dipping them in hot melted chocolate is pretty much the law
another typical item on a tapas menu croquetas are tubes of bechamel sauce encased in fried breadcrumbs but a lot more tasty than that sounds
jam n croquetas and salt cod croquetas are common varieties
they re tricky to make and are perhaps best enjoyed at a tapas bar along with a cold beer
a classic tapas item albondigas or meatballs in tomato sauce are served all over spain
a tasty variation serves up the meatballs drizzled in an almond sauce minus the tomatoes
a legendary dish spoken of in almost hushed tones by spaniards migas is a good example of how much of spain s cuisine has evolved from peasant food
it s essentially dry breadcrumbs torn up and fried in a variety of combinations often served with chorizo or bacon
best cities for street food from miami to tokyo
migas handed down from agricultural laborers who had to be thrifty with their ingredients is comfort food supreme and in recent times has found its way onto fancy restaurant menus
a prized dish in spain bacalao or salted cod was brought back for hundreds of years by spanish fisherman from as far afield as norway and newfoundland
the fish is not found in local waters and it was salted to preserve it on the journey
it has to be left to soak in water for at least hours to remove all but the slightest tang of salt
bacalao is served in all manner of dishes one of the most popular is with pil pil sauce made of olive oil garlic and the juice of the fish and typical in the basque country
a favorite of the northwestern asturias region and based around the white fabe bean fabada is a one pot feast usually served with a mixture of pork meats
chorizo pork belly and bacon are common accompaniments as is morcilla spanish blood sausage which tastes far better than it should
think it s impossible to fry milk think again
leche frita or fried milk is a popular dessert made by whipping up milk egg yolks and flour
this is left to chill and solidify before being coated in breadcrumbs and fried
it can be served hot or cold
