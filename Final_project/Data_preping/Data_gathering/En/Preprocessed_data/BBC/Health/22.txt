now engaged to be married michelle jin has been thinking a lot about last names
she hears about the unity and simplicity that comes with changing hers to her future husband s but she doesn t want to erase her identity family heritage and experience from her name said jin who lives in new york city
my last name was called out at my middle high school and college graduations and is on every single one of my diplomas she said
she is now in a doctoral program
i do dream that my name will one day follow the address of doctor
younger women such as jin are more likely to keep their last name after marriage according to new data
a new survey from the pew research center published thursday asked more than married people and people who have never been married about their stance on changing their names after marriage
these women wanted a symbolic expression of self love
so they married themselves
this data was a small part of a larger survey into modern views of marriage and family said kim parker pew s director of social trends research
men largely kept their last names at while changed their last names and less than hyphenated their names with their partner s last name the data showed
for women there was more variation
the tradition of women changing their names upon marriage is still strong in the united states but views on marriage have been changing the survey said
most married women in opposite sex relationships nearly said they took their husband s last name
meanwhile said they kept their own last name and hyphenated with their husband s last name the data showed
but the numbers indicate age and education played a role in the decision making
about of women ages and older said they kept their last name in comparison with of women between and the survey showed
and of women with a postgraduate degree said they kept theirs
women who are not married were significantly less likely to report plans to take their partner s last name
only said they would whereas said they would keep their own last name would hyphenate both and were not sure the data showed
i m open to it but not tied to it said melanie mayer of new york city
mayer said she feels conflicted about changing her name
while she sees the tradition as rooted in patriarchal norms she does like the idea of a nuclear family having the same last name though she said it doesn t have to be the man s name
while the idea of joining last names is nice it s also erasing a lot of your history she added
the shift in younger generations may follow the progression of women gaining social power said deborah ashway a licensed clinical mental health counselor in new bern north carolina
now this just seems to follow suit she said women are like no i m going to keep my own name that s kind of a statement of independence
pew doesn t have past data to compare whether the views are changing parker said
but you can see by looking at some of the demographic differences where this trend might be headed she added
why is it so common for women in the us to take their husband s name in an opposite sex marriage
it s not about culture it started with the law said catherine allgor president of the massachusetts historical society
the law is called coverture and it came along with english immigrants when they came to the us she said
this law says that females don t have a legal identity when they are born instead they are covered by their father s legal standing
when a woman got married that identity under her father was legally dissolved and she was absorbed into her husband s identity allgor said
it meant that not only could she not vote but a woman could not legally own anything make a contract have custody over her children or be protected from physical abuse or rape by her husband
when women talk about marriage we talk about becoming one allgor said
with coverture you are becoming one but the one was the husband
coverture was broken down and ameliorated over time but pieces of it persisted she added
in the s and s divorced women couldn t always get credit in their own names
and it wasn t until the s that the law began to recognize marital rape allgor said
women keeping their last name upon marriage gained popularity with the feminism movement in the s and s with some changing their maiden last names to something else entirely since that name had originally come from their fathers she added
some women also started hyphenating their last name with their husband s more allgor added
when it comes to deciding whether to change your name after marriage the right answer is the one that works for you ashway said
start by examining your priorities wants and needs she said
of the biggest decisions you ll ever make and how to approach them
for some people a sense of independence or a challenge of the historical power structure may be the most important
for others the priority may be having the whole family including kids sharing the same last name ashway said
then have a conversation with your partner
it can start with just getting a sense of how each of you feel and exploring values she said
one thing to watch for is how you feel about your partner s response ashway said
if marriage is off unless you take that person s name is that a red flag for you
it should be something that you both feel good about she said
it s really got to be both parties decision because then you get back into that power differential ashway said and then that s not going to make for a great relationship
