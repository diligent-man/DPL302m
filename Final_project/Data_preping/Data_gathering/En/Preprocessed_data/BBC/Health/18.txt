Feeling run down even after you kicked an infection It could be a case of a long cold according to a new study
Much like long Covid in which symptoms persist after a Covid infection has cleared other respiratory infections may continue to affect people who believe they are on the other side of a cold researchers found
This study is important because not only does it reiterate the huge impact that COVID can have long term but also highlights that people with other respiratory infections may also be struggling to recover from the acute episode said lead study author Giulia Vivaldi statistician and epidemiologist on the Covidence UK study from Queen Mary University of London
Scientists finally know why people get more colds and flu in winter
According to a study of children and of adults had reported ever having long Covid which those researchers defined as having symptoms that last at least three months after the infection
The latest scientific paper published Friday in The Lancet’s EClincialMedicine journal surveyed more than people asking them to report on whether they had each of the symptoms found in long Covid Vivaldi said Researchers also inquired whether they had had a Covid infection another respiratory infection or neither
People who had been infected with Covid and those who had other respiratory infections were both more likely to have symptoms persist than those who had not had either infection since May according to the new study
The symptoms included fatigue shortness of breath dizziness difficulty concentrating memory problems stomach problems coughing and sleeping trouble the report said
The study took into account other health problems that may have influenced these symptoms Vivaldi said
Researchers still can’t say how long a long cold could last in comparison with long Covid but hopefully the new findings will motivate further work into the understanding diagnosis and treatment of syndromes after an infection the study said
Whilst in among the first to explore this prospectively this is not a new phenomenon said Dr David Strain associate professor and honorary consultant at the University of Exeter Medical School in the United Kingdom Strain was not involved in the research
In the early th century the influenza pandemic left many people with symptoms that lasted decades he added
Popular OTC medicines for colds and allergies don’t work FDA panel says
Today in the UK approximately people are living with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis ME otherwise known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome many of whom report a rather benign initial viral illness as the trigger Strain said in a written statement
Previous research into lasting symptoms has largely focused on severe diseases Vivaldi said adding that the Covid pandemic was one of the few times that medical research wasn’t focused solely on people who were hospitalized
It took a strong patient voice to bring long COVID to the attention of the public and the medical community Vivaldi said in an email In honour of those patients we need to ensure that we do not lose the momentum we have in long COVID research and that we take this opportunity to build our understanding and knowledge of post infection syndromes more generally
While there is still work to do in learning how to alleviate symptoms it is clear from the experience with long Covid that persisting symptoms should be taken more seriously

People should expect a slow return to normality and not expect to immediately return to full activities immediately after an acute respiratory infection from whatever cause said Dr Peter Openshaw professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London Openshaw was not involved in the research
