As a strike gets underway Kaiser Permanente one of the United States largest not for profit medical systems says it has contingency plans in place so it can continue to provide safe high quality care for its million members and patients
Health care is in crisis The looming strike by health workers is just another sign of that
The strike is the largest health care strike in American history involving more than workers at locations across the country about of Kaiser s staff Workers began to walk off the job early Wednesday morning and are scheduled to continue through early Saturday with plans to strike for a longer period in November if necessary
A walkout does not leave the Oakland California based health care system completely without employees As of June Kaiser Permanente employs more than nurses technicians administrative and clerical workers as well as nearly doctors at its hospitals and medical offices About of staffers would still be working in the event of a strike it said
Although this walkout would be the first national strike effort at Kaiser Permanente the health system said last week that no patients in Georgia Hawaii or Washington would be affected and operations would continue as usual in those states A Kaiser Permanente spokesperson later clarified that two medical offices in southwest Washington will strike but are considered to be part of the health care system s Oregon region
In Virginia and the District of Columbia optometrists and pharmacists are the only workers preparing to strike
But the effects for patients in Colorado Oregon and California could be more substantial a Kaiser spokesperson said
We have detailed continuity plans in place in all of these markets that include the use of non represented and management staff along with contingency workers In addition all our physicians will be available the spokesperson said
But the unions that are striking represent people who are crucial to patient care including EMTs nurses respiratory therapists and support staff
Under pressure that hasn t eased since the pandemic some health care workers are preparing to strike
Should a brief or day strike occur our hospitals and emergency departments will remain open Kaiser said in a statement early Wednesday Our facilities will continue to be staffed by our physicians trained and experienced managers and staff and in some cases we will augment with trained contract workers to serve in critical roles specifically for the duration of a strike
Our members and patients who need urgent or timely medical care should continue to seek it at our hospitals and medical facilities it said A strike should not dissuade anyone from seeking necessary care
During a strike it may expand its network to include non Kaiser Permanente hospitals if patients need to be redirected or transferred
The system said non emergency and elective services may have to be rescheduled but it will contact patients in advance if so
It also may encourage members to use its mail order pharmacy Inpatient pharmacies in hospitals will remain open but it said it may expand Kaiser Permanente s pharmacy network to include retail pharmacies during the strike
Working with fewer employees wouldn t be easy according to John August director of health care labor relations at Cornell University and former executive director of the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions
Managers are still going to be there The doctors are still going to be there From the outside looking in it s easy to say that it s not going to be that disruptive he said The reality is it s extremely disruptive
As with many health care systems in the US Kaiser Permanente has been operating short on staff ever since the Covid pandemic began it said Inadequate staffing is one of the issues workers are negotiating

Kaiser Permanente says it has been working to bulk up staffing It set a goal of hiring additional workers by the end of the year and should reach that mark this month it said About staffers were hired in and an additional this year
Studies that have looked at the effects of walkouts on patient care have found that they re disruptive but have only a marginal impact if any on patient outcomes
One analysis that looked at longer strikes suggested that they had little impact on patient morbidity Another analysis of several studies involving million patients globally found no clear negative effects on patient mortality
