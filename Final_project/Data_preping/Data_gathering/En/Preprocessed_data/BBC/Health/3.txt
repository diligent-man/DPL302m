some of the nation s largest cancer centers are reporting little improvement in an ongoing shortage of critical chemotherapy drugs in the united states
among cancer centers across the country reported a shortage of the chemotherapy medication carboplatin and are still seeing a shortage of the drug cisplatin according to survey results released thursday by the national comprehensive cancer network
carboplatin and cisplatin are used in combination to treat many types of cancer
cancer centers hospitals still feeling effects of ongoing cancer drug shortages
overall the majority of surveyed centers reported a shortage of at least one type of anti cancer drug
the survey conducted from september to among of the network s institutions is an update to a survey conducted in may that found of cancer centers reported a shortage of carboplatin and reported similar shortages of cisplatin
cisplatin and other similar platinum based drugs are prescribed for an estimated to of all cancer patients according to the national cancer institute
several cancer medications have been in and out of shortage for years and there have been record shortages this year according to the american association for cancer research
the white house said in september that the nation has a shortage of cancer drugs due to manufacturing and supply chain issues
three of those drugs cisplatin carboplatin and methotrexate are widely used generics that have been staples of cancer treatment for decades
everyone with cancer should have access to the best possible treatment according to the latest evidence and expert consensus guidelines dr
robert carlson ceo of the national comprehensive cancer network said in a news release
drug shortages aren t new but the widespread impact makes this one particularly alarming
it is extremely concerning that this situation continues despite significant attention and effort over the past few months he said
we need enduring solutions in order to safeguard people with cancer and address any disparities in care
cancer experts demand action to end ongoing drug shortage people s lives are really at stake
carboplatin and cisplatin are core drugs for treating cancer and questions need to be answered about how to make sure shortfalls don t happen again said dr
william dahut chief scientific officer for the american cancer society who was not involved in the new survey
the manufacturing side is really the aspect that s most important to get this right he said
should there be some drugs in reserve should there be ability to look at supply chains or economic issues dahut asked
but who actually would enforce those who would pay for those how would that work i think that needs to be worked out
but i do think a short term medium term and long term philosophy is needed as opposed to moving from crisis to crisis
the centers that took part in the new survey also said that several other key cancer medications are in short supply with reporting a shortage of the chemotherapy methotrexate a shortage of the chemotherapy fluorouracil for the chemotherapy fludarabine and for the corticosteroid medicine hydrocortisone
nearly all of the centers in the survey reported being able to treat every patient who needed carboplatin or cisplatin despite a lowered supply by implementing strict waste management strategies and other approaches
these drug shortages are the result of decades of systemic challenges alyssa schatz the network s senior director of policy and advocacy said in the news release
sign up here to get the results are in with dr
sanjay gupta every tuesday from the cnn health team
we recognize that comprehensive solutions take time and we appreciate everyone who has put forth proposals to improve investment in generics and our data infrastructure schatz said
at the same time we have to acknowledge that the cancer drug shortage has been ongoing for months which is unacceptable for anyone impacted by cancer today
these new survey results remind us that we are still in an ongoing crisis and must respond with appropriate urgency
the cancer centers that were surveyed are leading academic centers and may not reflect any additional challenges that smaller practices may be experiencing especially in rural areas or in communities that are under resourced according to the network
the network is a not for profit alliance of cancer centers in the united states including fred hutchinson cancer center the mayo clinic comprehensive cancer center md anderson cancer center and the sidney kimmel comprehensive cancer center at johns hopkins
