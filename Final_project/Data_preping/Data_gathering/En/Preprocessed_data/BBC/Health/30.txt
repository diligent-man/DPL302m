new image james webb space telescope revealed surprising pair planet-like object orion nebula never detected before
orion nebula glowing cloud dust gas one brightest nebula night sky identifiable sword orion constellation
located light-year earth nebula ha long presented astronomer wealth celestial object study including planet-forming disk around young star brown dwarf object mass planet stars
astronomer used webb near-infrared camera called nircam capture mosaic orion nebula short long wavelength light revealing unprecedented detail unexpected discoveries
mccaughrean studied short-wavelength image orion nebula zoomed trapezium cluster young star-forming region thats million year old filled brim thousand new stars
addition star scientist spotted brown dwarf small kick-start nuclear fusion core become stars
hunt low-mass isolated object astronomer found something never seen pair planet-like object mass time mass jupiter appear defy fundamental astronomical theories
although massive planet jupiter roughly size slightly larger said pearson european space agency research fellow european space research technology centre netherlands
astronomer found pair jumbos two triple system wide orbit around one another
although exist pair object typically astronomical unit apart time distance earth sun
object temperature range degree fahrenheit degree celsius f c pearson said
gaseous object young astronomically speaking million year old
halfway life sun object orion day-old baby said mccaughrean senior adviser science exploration european space agency
theyre still quite luminous warm energy get created still allows glow see thing first place mccaughrean pearson written two research paper based discovery orion nebula using webb telescope
study submitted academic journal publication preliminary finding available preprint site called arxiv
many question jumbos remain including came first place
star form giant cloud gas dust collapse beneath gravitational forces
process continues disk gas dust swirl around star giving rise planets
existing theory explain jumbos formed theyre present orion nebula mccaughrean said
instance may consider jumbos like rogue planet object planetary mass freely travel space without orbiting stars
many rogue planet begin orbiting star ejected would hard explain pair kicked time remaining gravitationally connected other
scientist working theory model star planet formation decade none ever predicted would find pair super low mass object floating alone space seeing lot pearson said
main thing learn something fundamentally wrong either understanding planet formation star formation both
orion nebula favorite observational target astronomer larger sophisticated telescope become object revealed within nebula mccaughrean said
object looking really faint brightest infrared best chance detecting pearson said via email
jwst powerful infrared telescope ha ever built observation simply wouldnt possible telescope
observation nebula scheduled early could provide insight atmospheric composition jumbos pearson said
researcher also want uncover detail object including making precise measurement masses
meanwhile research focused different star-forming region could reveal whether jumbos elsewhere beyond orion nebula
unexpected lot future observation modelling going needed explain it
