these simple steps to add nutty goodness elevate the flavors in a recipe and boost the nutrition in your dish
nuts get rave reviews from nutritionists like me primarily because of their healthy fat profile
walnuts almonds pistachios and hazelnuts are rich in cholesterol lowering monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and contain lower amounts of cholesterol raising saturated fats
so do peanuts which are technically legumes
and that s not all
nuts contain dietary fiber plant based protein vitamin e and potassium calcium and magnesium
because they re chock full of these nutrients and the fats that support heart health the us food and drug administration allows packages of nuts to sport this qualified health claim scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that eating ounces per day of most nuts as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease while the government speak wording seems a bit wishy washy the fda claim is meant to encourage daily nut consumption to help prevent heart disease
here s how to eat to live longer new study says
nuts are nutrient dense foods filled with healthy fats that are linked to optimal health primarily heart health benefits said sharon palmer a registered dietitian nutritionist and author of the plant powered plan to beat diabetes eating just a handful of nuts a day lowers ldl bad cholesterol levels and benefits blood pressure and inflammation which can lead to better heart health
how many nuts do you need to nosh to gain heart health benefits one and half ounces equal about a handful
since hand sizes vary a more specific equivalent measurement is cup
just how many you count per serving depends on the nut
you ll get more tiny pistachios than chunky walnut halves for instance
haven t seen your favorite nut named yet when the fda originally published the qualified health claim several varieties of nuts including pecans macadamias and cashews were omitted because of their slightly higher concentrations of saturated fats
but further research determined that macadamia nuts are impressively high in monounsaturated fats so the fda approved use of the health claim in
pecans were added to the list too
what about cashews cashews have not been approved to use the fda health claim even though most of the saturated fat in cashews is from stearic acid a fatty acid thought to have no effect on blood cholesterol and studies have shown that eating cashews can even lower levels of harmful ldl cholesterol
the evidence that nuts are a healthful choice just keeps piling up
the terrific trio of protein fiber and healthy fats in nuts adds satiety to meals and snacks and helps you feel fuller longer
in people who eat healthy meals blow it on snacks study says
they re considered a tasty tool for weight management with studies showing that people who include nuts in their meal patterns tend to weigh less
there are even benefits for potential diabetes prevention cancer protection and brain health with nut consumption palmer said
some nuts have been linked to gut health improved fertility and reduced risk of alzheimer s disease
in the health and beauty category research shows that nutrients in almonds such as vitamin e selenium and zinc support skin health by reducing facial wrinkles and improving skin tone
no matter how inspired you get to sprinkle more nuts into your food life note that current advice recommends a handful not a full can
nuts are high in fat content so they re also high in calories
and to reap the most benefits it s key to make eating nuts a habit over the long haul
many healthy eating patterns such as the renowned mediterranean diet include nuts on a regular basis in the diet palmer said
these have been important parts of cultural diets since the beginning of time
each nut has its own nutrition story to tell
almonds a good source of calcium vitamin e and fiber content almonds also rank high in protein content with grams per ounce
peanuts technically legumes peanuts are a good source of fiber and serve up more protein than tree nuts with grams plant based protein per ounce
pecans they rank high in zinc iron and the b vitamin niacin content
pecans are second just behind almonds in vitamin e content
pistachios ranked highest among the nuts in potassium content and noted for supporting blood pressure control they match almonds at grams protein per ounce and are a good source of vitamin b and iron
walnuts an excellent source of plant based omega fatty acids walnuts are noted for reducing inflammation and a good source of vitamin b and magnesium
rather than picking one nut to be your go to perhaps mixing it up is the best way to ensure you re getting all the possible nutrients the nut world has to offer
so pick pecans one day and walnuts the next
or just grab a package of mixed nuts
to save money when buying nuts think small such as nut pieces and nut meal
the most expensive way to buy them is perfectly shelled such as whole almonds pecan halves and walnut halves
you can buy pecan pieces which sell for less per pound
nut meals not to be confused with nut flours are ground up nuts often a biproduct of the shelling process
they can be used as a coating for baked chicken saut ed fish or roasted vegetables
it s easy to snack on nuts as part of a healthy lifestyle but i also use nuts in many recipes
i add toasted pecan pieces to wild rice or brown rice dishes
pistachios are the base i use to make a basil and garlic pesto instead of pine nuts and they work as a dressing for pasta salads too
i also like to garnish cooked vegetables with nuts try steamed broccoli with almond slivers
to add satisfying crunch to snack time i sprinkle chopped mixed nuts on top of yogurt
need more ideas
use nuts instead of breadcrumbs to bread chicken and fish or go with half breadcrumbs and half finely chopped pecans pistachios walnuts or almonds said liz weiss blogger at liz s healthy table
when using a box mix to make pancakes or muffins add finely chopped nuts or nut meal to amp up the nutrition
