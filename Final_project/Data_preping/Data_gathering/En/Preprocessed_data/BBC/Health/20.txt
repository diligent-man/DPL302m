louis aronne s weight loss center in new york city the reactions to new medicines like wegovy and mounjaro can be extreme
people describe it as it s like a miracle like this has transformed my life said aronne director of the center for weight management and metabolic clinical research at weill cornell medicine
researchers link popular weight loss drugs to serious digestive problems for hundreds of thousands worldwide
his clinic works with people who have a significant amount of weight to lose or multiple health problems connected to weight he said not those who are pounds overweight for people in the former categories he said it s like we re running a miracle clinic
but the medicines in a class known as glp receptor agonists are so popular among all sets of people seeking weight loss that demand has outpaced drugmakers capacity to manufacture them
and while makers novo nordisk and eli lilly are racing to expand supply a looming us food and drug administration approval for lilly s type diabetes medicine mounjaro to treat obesity may put even more strain on the system
over the past three to four months i ve had patients tell me that they can t get it dr
jody dushay a clinical endocrinologist at beth israel deaconess medical center said of mounjaro
as she prescribes the drugs for both diabetes and weight loss i m aware of our supply literally on a day to day basis
neither ozempic nor mounjaro is approved for weight loss specifically the fda greenlit them for type diabetes in and respectively
but doctors commonly use them off label for weight loss
wegovy which was approved in for obesity contains the same key ingredient as ozempic called semaglutide while mounjaro uses a slightly different one tirzepatide
all three drugs have been on the fda shortages list at various dosages
novo nordisk which makes ozempic and wegovy has limited the availability of lower starting doses of wegovy as it prioritizes a continuous supply of the drug for people who already use it
the company s ceo recently told cnn that it would take years to catch up to demand
lilly and novo nordisk are investing billions of dollars to expand capacity
cnn exclusive prescriptions for popular diabetes and weight loss drugs soared but access is limited for some patients
lilly is building two plants in north carolina spending billion to try to double production of so called incretin drugs including tirzepatide which mimic metabolic hormones that affect insulin secretion and appetite by the end of
that s when it anticipates an fda decision on mounjaro for chronic weight management after clinical trials showed that it helped participants lose more than percent of their body weight over weeks
production is already online at one of the two factories in research triangle park in durham
the facility uses high speed automation driverless vehicles and robotic arms to build autoinjectors for mounjaro around filled syringes
the plant is also gearing up to do product formulation in which the active ingredient tirzepatide is mixed with other components to make the finished medicine and then poured into syringes
lilly said it s running the plant around the clock every day of the week to try to meet demand
still synthesis of the starting ingredient tirzepatide takes months said edgardo hernandez the company s president of manufacturing operations because it involves a series of chemical reactions to link together amino acids into a peptide as well as purification and quality control steps
it s a massive scale of what we re trying to do he said
we are aggressively moving to deploy capacity
mounjaro is on the fda s shortages list in the milligram dose the third highest available
hernandez said that s because the way people are using the medicine is different from what lilly had predicted
the starting dose is milligrams and every four weeks patients can increase the dosage until they have adequate control of their blood sugar according to mounjaro s prescribing information
doses go up to milligrams
we ve been learning all along hernandez said
we re using artificial intelligence and machine learning to be better at predicting how patients are titrating through doses
ozempic and wegovy maker just scratching the surface in meeting demand for weight loss drugs ceo says
for weight loss aronne said the results in lilly s trial were similar at the milligram and milligram doses
aronne helped run the study and consults for multiple companies working on medicines for obesity
you could imagine that people would stop at he said
a lot of people will tell you that they want to save some room in case i have to increase it later on
the medicines come with side effects most commonly gastrointestinal issues like nausea vomiting constipation and diarrhea making higher doses potentially less appealing
they ve also been linked to a potential risk for more severe effects like stomach paralysis
insurance coverage for the medicines can also be a challenge and without it they cost more than a month out of pocket
both the insurance issues and the supply issues have led to hard choices for clinicians like dushay who said she grapples with prescribing decisions while knowing there aren t enough of the medicines to go around
because of all these complexities it s just made every clinic session just become this layer of being really philosophical about things she said
you re thinking about everyone s situation in a way where there s just more subjectivity in terms of thinking about who needs these medications more
finding the medicines may be more difficult in areas with more wealthy people capable of paying out of pocket aronne said he noted that s been his experience with patients in manhattan
we see a lot of businessmen lawyers people like that he said
they could potentially afford these things and they go buy it so there s a lesser supply
and while mounjaro is already used off label for weight loss fda approval for that use could boost demand even more if experiences with ozempic and wegovy are any indication
prescription information from data provider iqvia shows that more than million people had prescriptions for ozempic in july in the us and an additional had prescriptions for wegovy
with the shortage some might think that we re not producing any products but we have one of the biggest products in the category that s growing by very large double digit percentage points novo nordisk ceo lars fruergaard jorgensen told cnn in august
so we re ramping up significantly and we ll be investing a lot in the future years to come

those investments are expected to see returns many times over investment firm bmo capital markets estimates that obesity drugs will bring in billion in annual revenue worldwide by
until supply ramps up though doctors like dushay find themselves working with patients to try to increase time between doses or lower the amount people take at once when they run into shortages
she said she s even had patients struggle to find the medications for long enough that they regain some of the weight they d lost
lilly said it s working as fast as possible to address the shortage
we re doing everything we can to stand up supply dan vondielingen head of the company s research triangle park site told cnn
it s truly a privilege to be able to make medicine that s life changing for our patients
