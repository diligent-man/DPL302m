Parents of young children are scrambling to find still scarce doses of the updated Covid vaccine which was recommended in mid September for everyone ages months and older
When they can find it some say they re running into additional barriers that prevent their children from getting the shot Appointment scheduling snafus age cutoffs at pharmacies insurance reimbursement confusion and guidelines that discourage mixing and matching different brands of vaccines for younger children have all created headaches for families
The frantic search comes as Covid hospitalizations among young children raised new concern Since June hospital admissions in people younger than have risen fivefold from to nearly in the week ending September according to data compiled by the American Academy of Pediatrics Hospitalization rates in adults rose about threefold over the same period Children under are at highest risk
She s a health policy expert She still had trouble getting her Covid vaccine
Kristin Kessler doesn t want her year old son Jackson to be one of them Jackson has asthma that s triggered by respiratory infections He had his initial shots to protect him from Covid but is due for an update Kessler said
He was hospitalized last year for a couple of days For we re not even sure what the respiratory virus was but something that just kind of pushed him over the edge said Kessler who lives in the Washington area
His pediatrician is part of a large medical group with several locations in the northern Virginia area but when Kessler called to ask if they had any Covid vaccines staffers told her they weren t going to offer it and advised her to go to the federal government s Vaccines gov site which offers a location finder for people searching for available shots
Pharmacies in her area will vaccinate children as young as and in store clinics will sometimes vaccinate kids as young as months but she said she scoured pharmacy and clinic websites with no luck
The closest appointments for kids Jackson s age are two to three hours away
If it comes down to that that s what I would do but I m trying to find something that s closer Kessler said
She and her husband both work full time Jackson goes to day care and every time he gets a cold she tracks his blood oxygen levels and counts his breaths to make sure he s OK
It s concerning that it s been such a struggle in that I have to put in so much effort just to try to find him a vaccine Kessler said
In the Minneapolis area Jennifer Coleman said her family is very Covid cautious after her husband had long Covid for a year following an infection early in the pandemic
Almost of adults and of kids have struggled with long Covid survey finds
Their pediatrician wasn t sure when or if the office would offer updated Covid vaccines so Coleman started searching elsewhere She was able to schedule an appointment for her teen next week but finding a shot for her year old has been much harder
There s just been no priority around the pediatric vaccines Coleman said And these are the kids that are in kind of viral Petri dishes that are their day cares and my daughter s day care did have a pretty large outbreak
During the health emergency the US Department of Health and Human Services gave pharmacists nationwide the ability to immunize children as young as Since it ended pharmacies in Minnesota can t vaccinate kids under age
We re completely locked out of all the pharmacies Coleman said
Coleman said she tried to get into several local children s hospitals that were having vaccination events but they all had Pfizer vaccines Her daughter previously had Moderna shots and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children under get the same product for all their vaccine doses So she s still looking
Honestly I think it s maddening Coleman said And we really are just trying to protect these kids from what we know could be very seriously damaging virus through the modern science that we should have accessible to them
It seems like poor planning that the rollout has been this way and unfortunately these kiddos have been on the receiving end of this
Adults saw some of the same scheduling and insurance issues when the updated Covid vaccines first rolled out last month but government and insurance officials say they ve largely resolved
For kids the list of things still slowing the rollout is lengthy
Free Covid tests are now available for order from the US government
First is cash flow The pediatrician s office is the medical home for kids where young children get most of their routine immunizations But pediatricians operate on tight margins and some say the economics of these vaccines don t work for them The updated Covid vaccines now cost about four to five times the average price that the government was paying for them according to the health policy think tank KFF
When the government was paying for the Covid vaccines the only thing doctors had to figure out was how to store them since the shots require ultra cold storage or refrigeration for up to a month But since commercialization when companies began selling the Covid vaccines on the open market some offices have been reluctant to buy them said Dr Jesse Hackell a pediatrician in Pomona New York
For the first time they re laying out money in advance to get the vaccine Hackell said
When we used to get it for free it was easy he said It s a tremendous burden on the pediatrician to order it in advance and to pay for it
These offices are also taking a risk he said because they don t know what the demand for the vaccine will be He s heard from some of his fellow pediatricians they won t offer the shots
Is it a cold flu or Covid A doctor helps sort it out
Covid vaccination rates have consistently lagged for children In May when the public health emergency ended less than of children under had received the bivalent booster and less than of children ages to had received it CDC data shows
The explanation for those low numbers is often that parents are hesitant to vaccinate their kids but Fatima Khan co founder of the nonprofit advocacy group Protect Their Futures thinks these numbers may also tell a story about access and how difficult it is to get young kids vaccinated
There are a lot of parents out there that want to do the right thing They want to protect their children And again it s the red tape that is just not allowing kids to get protection she said
Khan said it s especially frustrating to hear public health officials tout the vaccines and urge people to get them when so many parents are fighting to do just that
It would be good to really hear from our leaders about what is going on and not just sort of the platitudes of like Be patient It ll happen but really like explain to parents and doctors alike why this is so complicated and what can be done to fix it she said
Kaley Beins of Rockville Maryland has been scouring websites trying to get her toddler vaccinated At months Petra is too young to get her shot in a pharmacy
As Covid hospitalizations climb rates among seniors and children raise concern
Unfortunately our pediatrician reported they had issues with insurance reimbursement Beins said
Her doctor s office said it would carry the updated Covid vaccine for kids but only through its cash only travel clinic Patients could pay out of pocket if they wanted the vaccine and then file with their insurance companies for reimbursement on their own
Beins discussed it with her husband We talked about it we decided that we were going to pay this out of pocket for a vaccine They have a health care savings account and they figured they d pay for it that way
But when they went to schedule Petra s appointment they learned that the clinic has only Pfizer shots in stock Petra previously had Moderna and because of the CDC guidance not to mix and match they decided to wait
Beins next called the Maryland Department of Health She said she was transferred and transferred until she reached a dead end line that didn t take messages
She tried calling the CDC number on the Vaccines gov website and it gave her the name of three clinics near her that had kids vaccines in stock But when she called the clinics none of them had the pediatric doses and they didn t know why the CDC was telling people that they did
So she wrote a long venting post on Facebook about her travails and another member of the Protect Their Futures group shared a link to the CDC s Vaccine Administration Management System which can help people schedule appointments Beins says she found a health fair that was giving Moderna shots for kids She and several members of the group eagerly booked appointments
But when they tried to call to confirm they couldn t get anyone on the phone
Everyone s kind of chatting each other on Facebook saying hey have you heard anything Do they have it We don t really know There s a rumor that there s a refrigeration issue but we can t get any answers she said
Not wanting to risk missing a shot for her daughter she went anyway
It was about an hour s drive with my almost year old who does not like car rides Beins said We showed up at the health fair and they said there s not enough refrigeration on site to handle the Covid vaccines would I like a flu shot
She drove home disappointed and got an email from the CDC canceling the appointment at p m hours after the fair had ended
Supply and insurance issues snarl fall Covid vaccine campaign for some
Petra is registered for another clinic in Manassas Virginia on Tuesday When Beins got the confirmation email however there was another surprise It said the clinic would not vaccinate kids under age But when she called she got a different story It wouldn t be a problem to vaccinate Petra
We have no idea if we ll actually be able to get this vaccine Beins said but her husband is taking the day off work and driving her daughter there just in case
Coincidentally Beins is a toxicologist who works in public health She s supposed to know how all these systems work
If I can t figure out how to do this how does the administration expect parents to do this and actually have uptake of this vaccine
She has another fear that this abysmal rollout will lead to fewer vaccine resources for kids in the future
They re going to use these data to say that people don t want the vaccine for their kids when really the failures are too great for kids to get it
Access is a problem said Hackell the pediatrician
About half the kids in the United States get free shots through the CDC s Vaccines for Children program which many doctors participate in But Hackell said orders for those vaccines opened on a state by state basis
As Covid infections rise nursing homes are still waiting for vaccines
Some states also allowed ordering even before the vaccine was released whereas others didn t open up their ordering supply until just this week he said
Some pediatricians say they plan to carry the vaccine but they haven t received any doses and don t know when they will arrive
Hackell said he has some colleagues across the country who have gotten their allotment of free vaccines but others are still waiting
So that s a real problem and it s an equity problem as well because kids who depend on VFC are the ones who are covered by Medicaid or uninsured And so those kids can often have a tougher time accessing the vaccine Hackell said
CDC Director Dr Mandy Cohen said Friday at a briefing sponsored by the National Foundation of Infectious Diseases that adult doses had been prioritized over vaccines for kids
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team
We do know that our manufacturers and distributors were getting out the adult vaccines first So that was what was shipping in the first number of days and now they are shipping pediatric vaccine Cohen said
On Monday one vaccine manufacturer said they were filling orders as fast as they come in They stressed that while some orders go directly to individual purchasers others first go to large distributors who then must process them and send them out and those additional steps take time
All orders are being fulfilled as received and of orders are being shipped within days of an order being placed said Kit Longley a spokesperson for Pfizer
Longley said Monday that the drug manufacturer had shipped million doses of its Covid vaccine including more than million pediatric doses
Moderna the other manufacturer of Covid vaccines for children didn t respond to a request for comment
