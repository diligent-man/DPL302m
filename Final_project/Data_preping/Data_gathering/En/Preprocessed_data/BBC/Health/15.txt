for the first time adults and older are eligible to receive a vaccine against the respiratory syncytial virus or rsv
although many people may have not heard of rsv it s worth knowing that the us food and drug administration has approved two vaccines for this age group arexvy made by the drug company glaxosmithkline and abrysvo made by the company pfizer
the us centers for disease control and prevention has also given the green light to the vaccines following fda approvals
since this is the first time an rsv vaccine has been made widely available some older people may be wondering why it might be needed
is rsv a major problem in adults especially older adults how effective are these new vaccines how should it be timed in relation to the covid and influenza vaccines and is there a similar vaccine to protect young children
to help us with these questions i spoke with cnn wellness medical expert dr
leana wen who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the george washington university milken institute school of public health
she previously served as baltimore s health commissioner
cdc recommends first vaccine to protect infants from rsv
cnn is rsv a major cause for concern in adults
leana wen while rsv is often thought of as a disease affecting children this viral infection also poses threats to adults in particular to older individuals
in the united states an estimated adults and older are hospitalized each year because of rsv
tragically around to older adults annually die from this infection
a new analysis from the cdc shows that between february and may while older adults had fewer hospitalizations for rsv than covid or the flu patients with rsv had more serious outcomes including the need for intensive care and needing advanced respiratory support
as with other infections such as covid those most likely to experience ill effects are those who are immunocompromised and who have serious underlying medical conditions such as heart lung and kidney ailments
at the moment the rate of seniors being hospitalized for rsv is about out of according to cdc data
this is uncharacteristically high for this time of the year and in fact is about times higher compared with years before the covid pandemic
the total number of hospitalized adults due to rsv is still relatively low but to me the overall point is that this is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can cause real harm in vulnerable people
it s a major breakthrough that there are now vaccines that can help protect against severe illness due to this virus
cnn how effective are the new vaccines
wen the studies leading to the approval of the two new rsv vaccines are very promising
according to independent government analysis of company data the vaccine from glaxosmithkline is effective against medically attended lower respiratory tract disease while the vaccine from pfizer is effective
these are terrific results
we have to keep in mind the most important reason for getting vaccinated which is to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death
given the toll of rsv on vulnerable individuals this is a very good level of protection and people at risk for severe illness should discuss with their health care providers about obtaining the shot
parents of young children say kids are being left behind as updated covid vaccines roll out
cnn if someone gets the rsv shot now will protection last through the winter or do they need to get another shot later
wen the rsv shot has good durability
results thus far show that at eight to months after the vaccine the effectiveness of the pfizer vaccine is still around
after months the effectiveness of glaxosmithkline s is more than
it s possible that one rsv shot may last more than one season
in any case it is not necessary to get multiple shots within a single year
i also do not recommend that people who have decided to get the rsv vaccine to wait
rsv infections are rising now and you want to get some immune protection prior to being exposed to rsv
if you get the shot now the protection will last you throughout this season
cnn how should people choose between the two rsv vaccines
wen the two vaccines have comparable levels of effectiveness
i would get whichever one is readily available at your pharmacy or doctor s office
cnn how should the rsv shot be timed in relation to the covid and influenza vaccines
wen people can receive the single dose rsv vaccine at the same time as other shots
someone could go to the pharmacy and receive all three shots for flu rsv and covid at the same time
they could also receive them one at a time
it s important to remember that people most likely to have ill effects from one of these viruses are also most susceptible to the others so these are individuals who would most benefit from all three vaccines
is it a cold flu or covid a doctor helps sort it out
cnn can adults who are not yet get the rsv vaccines
wen only those and older are eligible at this time with the exception of pregnant people who are also able to receive the pfizer vaccine during week to of pregnancy in order to convey antibodies to their babies
other adults younger than who are not pregnant are not able to access this vaccine
cnn is there a similar vaccine to protect young children
wen there are two options for protecting babies and very young children
the first is the vaccine administered to pregnant people
the second is a preventive antibody that can be given for infants younger than months old who are born during or entering their first rsv season
this antibody may also be given to children up to months old entering their second rsv season if they meet certain criteria such as having a chronic lung disease or being severely immunocompromised
both the maternal vaccine and the preventive antibody have been approved by the fda and given the green light by the cdc
of course as with every other aspect of your medical care people who have further questions about the rsv vaccine should discuss it with their physician or other health care provider
correction a previous version of this story misstated the efficacy of glaxosmithkline s rsv vaccine against lower respiratory tract disease
