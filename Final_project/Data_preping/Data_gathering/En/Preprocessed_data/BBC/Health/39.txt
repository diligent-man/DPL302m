Editor’s note Before beginning any new exercise program consult your doctor Stop immediately if you experience pain
For many people the thought of sweating in a noisy gym full of strangers or out under a hot sun is unappealing If that sounds like you and you’re looking for a way to improve your health consider giving cozy cardio a try
Cozy cardio is a term popularized by social media influencer Hope Zuckerbrow who is based in Paradise Texas In her TikTok videos which have gained million likes she is often seen on a walking pad in her living room which softly glows from colored lights and candles As she strolls on the pad sometimes in pajamas and a fuzzy robe Zuckerbrow watches TV and sips her favorite protein coffee drink After a half hour or so she’s done
Before these cozy cardio workouts Zuckerbrow followed a workout plan filled with loud music to lose pounds But after regaining about half of that weight she didn’t want to return to an intense regimen to improve her health
I realized I needed to heal my relationship with exercise Zuckerbrow said Exercise wasn’t fun anymore and I was only moving to lose weight not to feel good or be healthy I wanted to spark joy when it came to movement
So she gathered her favorite items — those candles colored lights and protein coffee — and began a slow relaxing stroll on her walking pad early one morning The first TikTok video she posted of her new exercise routine garnered views and cozy cardio was born But is a slow short walk effective exercise
Getting that initial momentum is great said Dr David Sabgir a cardiologist at OhioHealth Physician Group in Columbus Ohio You can’t go from to right away Just getting those endorphins and adrenaline going will facilitate getting into a more regular routine and a more intense level of exercise
Indeed Zuckerbrow now walks faster and longer than she initially did progressing from or minute walks to or minute treks at a faster clip

Finding an accessible way for people to start engaging with physical activity is excellent agreed fitness specialist Nick Occhipinti an assistant professor of anatomy at Rutgers University in Newark New Jersey That’s partly because there’s an inverse relationship between step count and all cause mortality he said The more steps you take the less likely you are to die Occhipinti said
Replacing minutes a day of sedentary time with light intensity physical activity was associated with an reduction in all cause mortality and a reduction in cardiovascular mortality according to a January study Another study of low intensity walking published in February showed beneficial effects on blood pressure and heart rate suggesting it may be an appropriate form of exercise for hypertension management especially for those who are frail or have a chronic illness
While cozy cardio sessions are definitely better than no exercise at all they should ideally lead to more vigorous activity experts say Adults should be getting minutes of moderate intensity physical activity each week according to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans published by the US Department of Health and Human Services
If cozy cardio is your first step to building up to that higher intensity excellent Occhipinti said But if that’s all you’re doing and it’s your understanding that that’s enough that’s a little misguided
To progress to moderate intensity exercise Occhipinti suggested going outside and timing how long it takes you to walk a mile The next time you head out for a stroll try to beat that time Then continue trying to best your time each week Exercise doesn’t have to mean sweat dripping everywhere and your heart racing but you do have to get to the point where you’re working hard enough to elicit fitness adaptations he said
Shifting your workouts to the outdoors — at least some of the time — is ideal Sabgir said as the health benefits of being outdoors are phenomenal One study from January showed visiting nature three or four times a week was linked to lower use of medication for issues such as high blood pressure and asthma In addition if you grab some friends to work out with you you’ll reap even more benefits

Sabgir started the global program Walk with a Doc in to get people moving and address the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle Physicians lead their patients on outdoor treks in their own communities He and his peers soon realized the social connection component of these walks was nearly as valuable to the participants as the physical exercise
Medical literature has shown in the past few years that social connections reduce hospital admissions for respiratory disease in older adults Sabgir said adding that social isolation increases the risk of death from heart attacks and strokes Walking with friends is also a great distraction as it keeps your mind off any anxieties you have and makes the time pass more quickly
Zuckerbrow’s fitness and stamina continue to increase and trips to the gym have replaced some of her cozy cardio workouts Yet she has no plans to ditch them entirely I don’t see myself ever stopping cozy cardio Zuckerbrow said Those workouts feel like meditational moments and truly bring joy to my day
Rucking is an easy way to boost your walking routine
That’s absolutely fine Occhipinti said as physical fitness is a lifelong pursuit Just get started go slow and be patient he said Over time you will reap the benefits
Sabgir agreed that easing into a new routine can help lay the groundwork for longtime success
Just dip your toe in the water Sabgir said Do something That will empower you to more and more activity I can’t remember one patient who started with something super small and stayed super small
