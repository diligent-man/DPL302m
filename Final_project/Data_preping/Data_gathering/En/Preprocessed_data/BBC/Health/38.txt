It wasn t something I originally intended to do long term
Abstaining from alcohol for a couple of weeks or even a month was nothing new to me However it would only be a matter of time before the drinking ramped back up along with the anxiety and regret afterward that could often last for days
I knew the key to alleviating these issues How to no longer fill in the blanks with the worst ideas imaginable of what I might have done or what may have happened the night before But frankly I was in denial
Giving up drinking for an indefinite amount of time was too big a leap for me But in October I knew I needed to break the cycle
You may need a Sober October more than you think Experts explain how to do it right
After one too many occasions of waking up with a hazy memory of the night before I started my sober journey after seeing this CNN Wellness piece which coincidentally published on the day I was feeling particularly rough
I read it thoroughly and bought This Naked Mind Control Alcohol the book by Annie Grace mentioned in the story s second paragraph As it turned out I needed more than a Sober October
But without alcohol would I still be fun Would I lose friends either because they would no longer want to be friends with me or I d no longer want to be around them Socializing and dating especially within the LGBTQ community are so centered on drinking how would I navigate that I ve gone weeks and even longer than a month without drinking before I don t drink every day or heavily every time I do so do I need to abstain entirely
The answers to those questions are yes I would still be fun no I did not lose friends yes dating is a struggle regardless of drinking and for the last one yes I do need to abstain If you feel as though you need to quit drinking even temporarily I think it s worth trying
Within weeks of abstaining I realized what had led me to this point
How much you drink could have an influence on how your teen drinks study shows
I wasn t a heavy drinker in my teens or early s but my alcohol use slowly accelerated in my late s I think it was due to a mix of work events where free booze flowed and a higher disposable income to afford more drinks I loved it all wine cocktails spirits and cider They took the edge off and lifted my mood
I turned in the middle of the pandemic in and what was already on the rise went up on an even faster trajectory Staying at home meant I didn t have to be up early to commute to an office so drinking more after work wasn t the issue it once was
I was also one of the people fortunate enough to be employed throughout the pandemic so the disposable income I d acquired in my late s stretched even further My drinking was at an all time peak by late
I was so in love with the idea of drinking that I didn t realize how much I had used alcohol to self medicate through stressful situations It wasn t necessarily the number of drinks I was putting away but the alcohol percentage of what was in my glass that escalated

A couple of days after my decision to abstain I thought it was time to tell my friends and family There was initially surprise from some I drank but not enough to warrant quitting in their eyes Overall they ve been supportive and as mentioned I haven t lost friends If anything our relationships are stronger as I can now be sure they aren t based on alcohol
Want to drink less or stay sober Here's how to deal with the social pressure
A friend who had stopped drinking five years ago told me that the first couple of months would be the most difficult They were and I don t know how I would have gotten through them if it weren t for the copious amounts of video games that I played to keep my mind busy Thank goodness that s not a bad habit partaking in moderate video game play has been shown to improve mental health according to studies from the University of Oxford and Australasian Psychiatry
The struggle hasn t been limited to those first few months Navigating birthday parties and weddings can be still daunting especially when I don t know most people on the guest list Drinking gave me the courage to face awkward social engagements What I ve found is that I just get more comfortable as the night goes on with or without alcohol
Explaining to guys on a first date why I don t have a drink in my hand has received mixed results I can t be sure of this but I imagine it s why there haven t been some second dates
But there have been many instances where people have either forgotten or not realized that I haven t been drinking That has made me see that I don t need to explain or even mention that I don t drink At one birthday party a friend pointed to my glass and said What are you drinking A gin and tonic He ran away to the bar before I could answer It s just tonic water
Heavy drinkers really don t handle their liquor study says
The benefits are obvious I have a higher disposable income I m sleeping a lot better and I m more focused at work I ve gotten through birthdays weddings dates and Pride season all without a drop of alcohol something I could not have foreseen months ago There s also the freedom of not having to think about the next time I ll potentially embarrass myself by drinking
Sobriety hasn t solved all my issues We often hear about the life changing aspects of putting down alcohol but doing so also has shed light on the other work I need to do on myself
Stepping away from drinking can be scary and I have been asked how I stay focused I found the Sober October feature and Grace s book to be so powerful they ve been my only source of staying sober Dealing with it as publicly or privately as you want also makes it slightly easier Set up realistic rules and goals that work for you But do not be hard on yourself if these goals aren t met
Will I stay sober forever I don t know I m trying not to put too much pressure on myself I m not sure about the future but right now I m focusing all the good that s come from my decision to take care of myself And I m celebrating a year of sobriety
