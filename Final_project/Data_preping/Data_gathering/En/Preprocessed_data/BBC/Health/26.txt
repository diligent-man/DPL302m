as humans we ve left our mark on every place we ve been including other worlds
rover tracks crisscross the red surface of mars and iconic boot prints from the apollo era still dot the moon
closer to home footprints across the globe have revealed the presence of different species over time including dinosaurs kneeling in the mud and the tracks of unknown human ancestors
the impressions present an intimate reminder of a specific moment a time capsule of the paths taken by those who came before us
and for scientists preserved footprints can lead to unexpected journeys into the past that rewrite history
when the discovery of fossilized human footprints found in new mexico s white sands national park was first announced in the ancient find changed the timeline of early humans living in the americas
the footprints were estimated to have been pressed into the mud between and years ago based on dating of seeds from an aquatic plant preserved along with the tracks
some scientists questioned the age of the footprints but new research has provided findings that point to the same time frame
our ancestors arrived well before climate conditions would have made it impossible to reach north america according to the new study
scientists still debate when and how prehistoric people arrived in the americas and archaeological evidence has been hard to find
that s why the footprints represent such a crucial missing chapter in human history
bright minds behind scientific advances in chemistry physics and physiology or medicine were awarded nobel prizes this week
quantum dots may not sound familiar but the tiny particles uncovered by a trio of scientists are used in led lights and tv screens as well as by surgeons when removing cancer tissue
meanwhile short pulses of light which rely on lasers can measure changes in electrons
the technique created by three physicists gave humanity new tools for exploring the world of electrons inside atoms and molecules according to the nobel committee
katalin karik and drew weissman s work on mrna vaccines was critical during the covid pandemic contributing to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times the committee said
astronomers used the james webb space telescope to peer inside the glowing orion nebula and found something completely unexpected pairs of planetlike objects
the pairs dubbed jupiter mass binary objects or jumbos have masses between and times the mass of jupiter and appear to defy some fundamental astronomical theories
and scientists aren t sure how the jumbos formed or why they re inside the nebula
the main thing that we learn from this is that there is something fundamentally wrong with either our understanding of planet formation star formation or both said samuel g
pearson a research fellow at the european space agency
future observations with webb could shed more light on the composition of the objects potentially providing clues about their origin story
on october nasa is aiming to launch its first mission to explore psyche an intriguing metal world that exists in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter
astronomers believe the asteroid shaped like a lumpy potato could be the iron rich core of an early planetary building block or something else entirely and the namesake psyche spacecraft s observations could finally uncover the answer
meanwhile china has announced its future lunar exploration plans including a mission to return the first samples from the far side of the moon to earth
redonda a small island in the caribbean sea is a haven for wildlife
but invasive species nearly destroyed this once pristine paradise
first documented by christopher columbus in redonda was explored and then exploited for its resources in the s
along with humans came invasive species such as rats that preyed on native species and feral goats that decimated the island s plants
rats came to rule the island after it was abandoned at the outbreak of world war i without vegetation to hold it together the landmass began to crumble into the sea
environmental groups stepped in to help in removing invasive species and that was all it took for redonda to come back to life
