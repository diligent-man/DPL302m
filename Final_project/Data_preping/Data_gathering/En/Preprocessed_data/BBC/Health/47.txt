explore universe news fascinating discovery scientific advancement more
two pioneering scientist created technology behind life-saving covid- vaccine nobel prize medicine physiology
drew weissman university pennsylvania achieved breakthrough harnessing power genetic material known messenger rna mrna
discovery opened new chapter medicine paving way new vaccine infectious disease including flu treatment noninfectious disease cancer
five thing know karik weissmans game-changing research mrna vaccines
messenger rna mrna form nucleic acid tell cell based information contained dna
unlike dna act instruction manual life contained every cell mrna temporary piece genetic code create protein repair damage
dna thick recipe book rna handwritten copy individual recipe get scrunched thrown away use
scientist long known mrna wa previously thought unstable value therapeutic tool
karik weissmans key breakthrough wa finding way alter building block rna called nucleotide order make body produce immune response
robin shattock professor mucosal infection immunity imperial college london said pair seminal work understanding configure rna wa critical success highly effective mrna vaccine covid-
fundamental work using modified nucleotide building block rna avoid activation innate immune system key successful use future rna vaccine new rna based medicine shattock said
many vaccine use weakened dead version virus theyre targeting enough make person sick amount make immune system respond body produce antibody encounter real virus
experimental mrna cancer vaccine immunotherapy reduces risk melanoma returning preliminary study finds
another related technique employed protein subunit vaccine us purified piece virus order trigger immune response
however development type vaccine lengthy difficult modify quickly
messenger rna-based vaccine technology doesnt rely modified version virus produce immune response
us modified mrna tell body cell produce protein train immune system defend body particular disease
kariks fascination therapeutic potential mrna started wa grad school hungary never wavered despite multiple setback job loss doubt transatlantic move
conviction could used fight disease drew skepticism grant applied often rejected
karik adjunct professor neurosurgery penn perelman school medicine met weissman chance in
nobel committee said weissmans background immunology kariks expertise rna biochemistry meant two scientist complemented well
think important thing couldnt come result without u involved said weissman robert family professor vaccine research perelman school medicine video shared monday university pennsylvania
groundbreaking study wa published year covid- pandemic began
thomas perlmann secretary general nobel assembly medicine said back many roadblock overcome could use technology vaccine form
obstacle included manufacturing mrna large quantity refining delivery method mrna cells
however said seminal work meant mrna-based covid vaccine got flying start pandemic came along
advent mrna vaccine technology ha led safe strong protection covid-
opinion thought mrna vaccine would end pandemic think again
early study suggest mrna technology show promise treatment cancer including melanoma pancreatic cancer studied use vaccine seasonal flu respiratory syncytial virus rsv hiv
avenue ongoing mrna research include exploring new avenue treat autoimmune diseases
mrna technology also checked possible alternative gene therapy intractable condition sickle cell disease
