Union members have voted to restart industrial action at Chevron’s liquefied natural gas facilities in Australia threatening renewed strikes that could disrupt about of global LNG supply
The decision was announced Friday two weeks after the US company and the Offshore Alliance which represents two Australian labor unions said they had accepted new employment agreements proposed by Australia’s workplace relations tribunal ending a protracted standoff
Chevron have reneged on the commitments they gave the Fair Work Commission only two weeks ago to incorporate the commission’s recommendations into Enterprise Agreements covering workers at the Gorgon and Wheatstone Downstream facilities Brad Gandy a spokesperson for the union group said in a statement shared with CNN
In the past days the Offshore Alliance had been working with Chevron CVX to finalize the agreements the alliance said in the statement
However as part of that process lawyers acting for Chevron have been attempting to walk back some clauses previously settled it added
Neither Chevron nor the Offshore Alliance responded to requests for comment on which specific terms were once again in question
Chevron told CNN Monday that it had not received an official notice of planned industrial action
Chevron Australia has consistently and meaningfully engaged in an effort to finalize enterprise agreements a company spokesperson said adding that the deal had included competitive remuneration and conditions
We have accepted the recommendation of the Fair Work Commission which proposed terms to resolve outstanding claims that would form part of the proposed agreements and we continue to work with all parties
According to Felix Booth head of LNG at energy data provider Vortexa the threat to restart strikes can be seen as an attempt by unions to help them get the best terms possible in the final contract
At this stage the commission’s recommendations have to be translated into the legal terms … which can reignite differences between the parties he told CNN Monday
The strikes may go ahead but the gas market is more comfortable with this news as the two parties have a mechanism to continue work towards
The deals proposed by the Fair Work Commission contain substantial improvements in terms and conditions of employment including increased remuneration job security locked in rosters and career progression the Offshore Alliance said on Sept
Chevron responded at the time that it had accepted the recommendation to resolve all outstanding issues
Workers at the company’s Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities began walking off the job in early September over pay and other conditions of employment
The sites’ importance extends well beyond Australia If strikes stopped production at the facilities for a month about of global LNG supply would be lost according to Daniel Toleman a senior gas and LNG analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie
In Europe the threat of strikes in Australia had caused a series of spikes in natural gas prices since August
On Friday Dutch natural gas futures the European benchmark closed higher at € per megawatt hour but were still down by almost a third from a late August high
It’s too early to assume a big impact on the gas market said Alex Froley LNG analyst at commodities research firm ICIS referring to the vote to restart industrial action The action could still be called off he told CNN Friday noting that even recent strikes hadn’t shut production down completely at the two sites
After Russia — once Europe’s biggest source of natural gas — invaded Ukraine last year the continent scrambled to find new suppliers ramping up imports of pipeline gas from Norway and of LNG mostly from the United States and Qatar Europe’s success in filling the gap left by Moscow has helped bring prices down from a record high of around € per megawatt hour hit in August
However European prices remain above their long term average Moody’s noted in a report Thursday
Persistently high and volatile gas prices will erode European competitiveness which is a longer term risk the credit rating agency wrote Gas prices will remain higher in Europe than elsewhere making energy intensive sectors like chemicals less competitive
