we are pleased to welcome back our employees who participated in this week s strike kaiser permanente said in a statement issued saturday
with the current strike behind us as of am saturday our collective focus is a return to normal operations
that will be different in differing locations

we are deeply appreciative of our members for their patience for the last three days
the strike took place across california colorado washington and oregon

at issue the kaiser permanente coalition of unions said are concerns exacerbated by the pandemic related to unsafe staffing levels and pay that hasn t kept up with skyrocketing rent and gas prices
rocio chacon a striking kaiser worker on the union s negotiating committee told cnn that many employees cannot afford to live in the cities where they work due to the rising cost of living and some workers resort to sleeping in their cars
as we speak there are nurses that are sleeping in their cars because of two reasons
one they can t afford the cost of living here so they have to move two three hours away and then because of short staff they re working hours so they re tired chacon said on wednesday the first day of the strike
so their best choice is to be monday through friday in their cars
kaiser permanente has argued it is a leader in pay
during the ongoing contract negotiations the company has discussed with union employees across the board wage increases including possible raises between and in the next four years
the coalition has instead asked for roughly a increase in the first two years of a contract and a increase in the final two years
the coalition has argued that wage increases will help kaiser attract new staff to tackle a dangerous labor shortage

kaiser said it has agreed to do aggressive work to hire more staff members and said it has hired people in union represented jobs so far this year
some picketers have cautioned that a portion of those hires were internal employees who shifted roles
unlike traditional health care providers in the united states kaiser operates as an insurance plan and a provider of all care covered by that plan

i teared up and i cried
