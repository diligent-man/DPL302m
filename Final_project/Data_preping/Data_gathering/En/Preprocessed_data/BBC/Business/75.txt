there s a newer photo sharing app and it s not like other social media platforms
the app is called bereal
and while you may not have heard of it a lot of young people are signing up
its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than according to data from apptopia which tracks and analyzes performance
we joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how bereal works and what you need to know about it
bereal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time
it was launched in early by an entrepreneur in france but a majority of its users at least have signed up this calendar year
as its name suggests the focus is on authenticity
users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they re doing at that moment giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life
it has no filters and no edit buttons
so if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot that s what people will see
the result is a far cry from the polished overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms
the concept of bereal is simple
once you download the app you get a notification once a day that it s time to bereal that means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you re doing no matter how mundane
there s no set time the notification comes at random times of the day adding to the app s mystique
push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day the company said in a statement
it s a secret on how the time is chosen every day it s not random
that means the potential window into your life can open at any time
when it does the app invites you to take a photo of what you re up to at that moment
it takes a dual photo a selfie and one showing what s in front of you
bereal doesn t permit videos yet
the result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday unglamorous things lounging in pajamas doing homework riding the bus microwaving their dinner
with only one post a day there s no clutter of friends pictures to mindlessly scroll through
you can only see friends posts if you share a photo which eliminates lurkers
some people turn off their location for privacy reasons since the app works in real time
georgetown university student ben telerski is an avid social media user and joined the app in august
what i like about bereal is i am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes comments or being artificial
solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off says telerski a junior majoring in government
telerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms
i try to post as soon as i see the notification even if i am just sitting in bed or walking to class he says
i think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media
if someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced bereal is not the app to use
when you click on the once a day bereal notification your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two minute countdown
you have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what s in front of you
at the same time your rear facing camera snaps a selfie
the app will share both images
you can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you re ready
bereal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day
but it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted
in short it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity
bereal has tapped into marketing on college campuses
it recruits young users via its college ambassador program which allows students to host events that educate others about the app
telerski believes the app is popular because it s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online
i have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on gen z
i do not know if bereal is directly attempting to combat this problem but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal he says
bereal won t make you famous if you want to become an influencer you can stay on tiktok and instagram
bereal
morgan nott manages a tea shop in reno and is a newbie on the app
she started using it last week at a friend s suggestion
nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non airbrushed non idealized glimpse into other people s lives
it s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing
users aren t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms she says
it s something different
in a statement bereal says its goal is to create an alternative to addictive social networks that focus on amassing influence it says
bereal is your chance to show your friends who you really are the company says
bereal won t make you famous if you want to become an influencer you can stay on tiktok and instagram
the app doesn t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos
but some users may still try to curate their lives on the app
there is the potential to be just as artificial on bereal as people tend to be on other platforms telerski says
some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends he says
it is not in the spirit of bereal and entirely defeats the purpose he says
bereal should be full of pictures of people walking doing homework and sitting in bed watching netflix
the young people cnn spoke to have no plans to give up instagram tiktok and other social media apps
nott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on bereal and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well
telerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform
authenticity is determined by a person not an app he says
for those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence he says
think about what social media was originally intended for real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life
maybe we should get back to that
