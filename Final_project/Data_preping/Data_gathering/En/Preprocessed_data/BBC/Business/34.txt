pharmacy employees at some walgreens stores including pharmacists technicians and support staff are planning a walkout between october an organizer who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution from the chain confirmed to cnn
some employees plan to walk out for just one day while others expect to shutter their pharmacies for all three days
employees at more than of america s approximately walgreens stores across the united states have expressed interest and solidarity a walgreens pharmacy employee and walkout organizer said though fewer will likely end up participating

the planned action comes after pharmacy employees walked off the job at multiple cvs stores in the kansas city area last week
walgreens ceo steps down
the coordinated action at some walgreens stores is in response to what pharmacy employees call burdensome prescription and vaccination expectations levied on pharmacists from corporate management according to the organizer
as a result employees often find themselves falling behind and dealing with angry customers
the company sets performance expectations based on the number of team members each pharmacy should have said the pharmacy worker
however in reality staffing is much lower than that
at the same time the worker said they ve cut training hours for new technicians
we don t believe that walgreens is allowing us to give our patients safe care on a daily basis the organizer explained
walgreens isn t responding they re not fixing those things
a representative from walgreens said the company has increased training for new pharmacists but has put a pause on what it called non critical training during the busy immunization season
walgreens representatives also told cnn that there have never been corporate quotas and that all task based metrics for retail pharmacy staff as part of team members performance reviews were eliminated last year
the company said it has made million in incremental investments in its nationwide pharmacy team this fiscal year and has created dedicated positions to manage inventory and administrative tasks for pharmacists
still one pharmacy employee who said staff at their store will participate in the walkout on monday told cnn that they are expected and incentivized to administer more vaccines
i spend almost all of my day in the shot room and if i m not in the shot room i m filling prescriptions because we re so behind they said
there have been nights where i ve been on the verge of tears because of how hard it is they said
i had a patient give me a fist bump and tell me i was doing a good job and that meant so much to me
the patients are caring more about us than the employer is
walgreens unveils chicago store with only two aisles and most products kept out of sight
another pharmacist told cnn that he expects his pharmacy to close during the planned walkout period and that he s heard from walgreens pharmacists at other stores in his state who are interested in participating
we re going to do way more harm to people in more years of operating like this than we would with a three day walkout the pharmacist said
it s time to try something different
every year we get the same promises and every year we get the same band aid on the problem
in a statement to cnn walgreens acknowledged that pharmacy employees were overworked
the last few years have required an unprecedented effort from our team members and we share their pride in this work while recognizing it has been a very challenging time said fraser engerman a communications director at walgreens
we also understand the immense pressures felt across the us in retail pharmacy right now
we are engaged and listening to the concerns raised by some of our team members
walgreens is committed to ensuring that our entire pharmacy team has the support and resources necessary to continue to provide the best care to our patients while taking care of their own well being added engerman
we are making significant investments in pharmacist wages and hiring bonuses to attract retain talent in harder to staff locations
pharmacy employees of walgreens and cvs and pharmacist advocates told cnn that their work has always been difficult but the pandemic made things near impossible
employees describe severe and chronic understaffing low pay high vaccination quotas long stretches without bathroom breaks abusive management and violent customers
inspired by successful labor strikes across the country this year they re saying enough is enough and organizing walkouts as part of what some labor advocates are calling pharmageddon
in september cvs pharmacists shuttered as many as pharmacies in two walkouts over two weeks in the kansas city area in a planned protest prompting executives from the rhode island based retailer to meet with staff and assure that additional support and higher overtime pay were coming
pharmacists are doing exactly what they ve been trained to do which is evaluate the situation and take whatever action is necessary to ensure that they re providing the best patient care said michael hogue ceo of the american pharmacists association who traveled to kansas city to meet with cvs executives and walkout organizers this week
we have a widespread problem in the us of inadequate staffing in community based pharmacies
prem shah cvs s chief pharmacy officer and president of pharmacy and consumer wellness issued an internal memo reviewed by cnn apologizing to his pharmacy teams for failing to address the concerns in the region more quickly
another meeting with shah is planned for late next week but no time or location has been set a cvs walkout organizer told cnn
cvs representatives told cnn that no specific meeting has been arranged because executives don t see this as a one time meeting or update situation
it s a continuous two way dialogue to share how we re meeting the commitments we made to our teams and to continue to hear their direct feedback said amy thibault lead director of external communications for cvs pharmacy
we re committed to providing access to consistent safe high quality health care to the patients and communities we serve and are working with our pharmacists to directly address any concerns they may have thibault told cnn in a statement
we re focused on developing a sustainable scalable action plan that can be put in place in markets where support may be needed so we can continue delivering the high quality care our patients depend on
a lead organizer of the cvs walkouts in kansas city told cnn that if there is no meeting this week there could be another round of labor action
even a day without access to medication would be disastrous for americans said amanda applegate with the kansas pharmacists association
but making sure that you re getting those prescriptions out in a timely efficient and safe manner is why pharmacists are walking out she said
pharmacists aren t demanding huge pay increases and vacation days she added they re asking for more help to get their jobs done
this week more than kaiser permanente workers walked off the job citing similar problems and marking the largest health care worker strike in us history
pharmacist advocates believe that the walkouts will likely continue for some time
cvs and walgreens pharmacists are not currently represented by a union and these efforts have been coordinated by individual workers
however multiple sources told cnn that employees at cvs and walgreens have recently been in touch with union groups
while kansas city has been a tinderbox said applegate these walkouts could have happened anywhere
it s a hard job on a good day
it s an incredibly rewarding job but it s hard she said
and so the idea of pharmacists essentially being turned into atms in these environments encouraging volume over quality is why this is happening
