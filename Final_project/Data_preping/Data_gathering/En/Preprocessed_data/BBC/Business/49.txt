editor s note this is an updated version of a story that originally ran on july
after no ticket matched all numbers drawn in monday night s powerball lottery anyone feeling lucky has another chance to win the jackpot which now stands at a whopping billion at the wednesday drawing
to be sure here s nothing wrong with fantasizing about winning the grand prize or dropping to to buy lottery tickets or scratch offs on occasion
in fact americans spent nearly billion on lottery tickets last year according to the north american association of state and provincial lotteries
however given everyone s dreadfully poor odds of winning big you have a better chance of being struck by lightning spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars a year in hopes of becoming a fast millionaire is a little like setting your cash on fire
if your real goal is to improve your financial situation and enjoy your life more here are a few easy ways to do that with the same amount of money you d spend playing your numbers but with a guaranteed return
let s be real
if you re willing to spend hundreds of bucks on lottery tickets scratch offs and other games of chance you may not be psyched to redirect that money into a retirement fund since the payoff may be decades from now
if that s the case for you why not spend most of your lottery money on experiences you know you like doing now
simply enjoy the money
put it in a fun fund
to go out to a fancy dinner or go on a vacation said personal finance educator tiffany aliche founder of thebudgetnista com and the live richer academy
if that money is going to be gone anyway i d rather you have lovely experiences
let it be gone in a way that holistically enriches your life
if you re carrying credit card debt one of the best ways to leave yourself with more money is to pay off or at least substantially pay down your highest interest debt
and reality check all credit card debt is expensive today since rates are at record highs
so redirecting most of your lottery spending dollars toward that end may improve your life markedly by relieving you of some financial strain
you ll have more money to spend on what you enjoy aliche said
or even if it s not something you enjoy per se it can help you pay for what you need like housing
overall your odds of winning a powerball prize of any amount are in the lottery says
but the chances of winning the big jackpot are so low think in million why not put most of what you usually spend on the lottery into an online high yield savings account instead many of which are paying between and interest
before you play in an office lottery pool read this
think of it this way let s say you spend a week on lottery tickets a year
and all in maybe you win over the course of a year
that means you re out
if instead you had banked that at you d have more than on hand instead
high yield accounts at fdic insured online banks let you park money you can tap any time you need it
and when you see your balance grow through regular automated deposits you might grow fond of the habit
that in turn will put you in a better position financially whatever your goals
