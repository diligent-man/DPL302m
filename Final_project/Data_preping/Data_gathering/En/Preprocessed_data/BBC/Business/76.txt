Electric vehicles with their need for lots of expensive batteries have often trended towards luxury
Electric cars from Porsche Mercedes and Audi have all hit the market in recent years
BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i and now the new i a battery-powered take on the brand’s new most expensive sedan
While BMW is probably better known for its smaller Series and Series cars the Series is the brand’s showpiece for luxury and technology
The i is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday
With a starting price of the all-wheel-drive horsepower i xDrive will be able to go miles on a full charge which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air
It will also offer a V-powered gasoline version the i X-drive with the same horsepower output and a starting price that’s less
A gas-powered version with a -cylinder engine will have a starting price of
This new version also highlights BMW’s flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi
While those other luxury brands’ electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge
BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power
BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines
Instead these vehicles have been designed from the outset to be built with any of these drive systems
A major benefit of doing it this way BMW executives say is that it gives the company flexibility to easily produce more or fewer electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs
With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either the car maker also doesn’t risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets
Another benefit BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said is that customers needn’t choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car
They can just decide they want to buy a BMW Series then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version just as they might decide whether they want a V or a straight- engine
Either way customers get the same luxury car experience and design
The downside of a common engineering platform is that to enable both electric and gasoline power designers need compromises
Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels
Electric cars on the other hand can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels and while they don’t have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel they need a large relatively flat area typically on the bottom of the car for the batteries
The Mercedes EQS electric sedan for example has only a short hood that houses some electronic components and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space
Zipse insisted the Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source
The driving experience will be excellent he said as will interior comfort and technology
There is no car with a more spacious luxurious second row he said during a meeting with journalists
Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car
In full-size sedans there generally isn’t much more room if any in the front seats compared to smaller cars
The extra space usually goes to those in the back
As in many other high-end large cars the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats
BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors’ though The front passenger seat if it’s unoccupied can also move forward and fold down to allow more space
BMW Series buyers can get an optional -inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers
Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light the Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone’s own living room according to BMW
Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked
Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway
Inside there are few knobs and buttons
Instead buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard
The car’s headlights are obscured by dark coverings while above them turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars
As an option the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight
As another option the Series’ large kidney grille can be outlined in lights at night
For when the driver would rather not bother assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways
This technology similar to General Motors’ Super Cruise requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times
The Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app
It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course such as around pylons in a parking garage on its own a feature somewhat similar to Tesla’s Summon mode
A sophisticated head up display which displays data in the car’s windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world
The system can also display parking regulations in the area
Performance is a core part of BMW’s brand image
For decades BMW’s marketing tagline was The Ultimate Driving Machine Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker’s performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered
With the new Series the i shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V-powered i
There are no plans for a V-powered -series model in this generation of the car
A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns
Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react
BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by
Both of those iconic British brands are owned by BMW and plan to sell only electric vehicles by
