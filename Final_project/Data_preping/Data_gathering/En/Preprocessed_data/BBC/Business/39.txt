however caroline lucas a spokesperson for the union coalition said in a statement wednesday that frontline healthcare workers are awaiting a meaningful response from kaiser executives regarding some of our key priorities including safe staffing outsourcing protections for incumbent healthcare workers and fair wages to reduce turnover

ju anna isaiah a ward clerk transcriber for kaiser permanente who is on strike in los angeles told cnn she is often the only person manning her unit due to a lack of new hires
isaiah s role requires her to help coordinate patients rooms after they leave surgery including booking beds for patients in intensive care
sometimes our or operating room can be backed up if we can t get patients out of the or fast enough into the recovery unit she said
it s really bad for the front line health care workers when we re trying to work with the patients and get them to where they need but we don t have the staff
isaiah s complaints echo those of other kaiser workers on the picket line
the union has called current staffing levels at kaiser unsafe and patient wait times dangerous
james bell a radiology technologist described patients getting out of bed after waiting too long to get help from the limited staff on duty resulting in falls
some of those patients have come to him for x rays for those injuries

every health care provider in the nation has been facing staffing shortages and fighting burnout
during the great resignation in more than million people left their health care jobs across the country
up to two thirds of health care staff are saying they are burnt out and more than in are quitting a spokesperson for kaiser permanente said
kaiser also said it is doing aggressive work to hire more staff members
the company said it has hired people in union represented jobs so far this year
workers on the picket line argue that kaiser permanente would do a more effective job hiring staff if the organization increased pay and benefits
according to the coalition some negotiating progress was made before the strike began though management and the unions have not yet come together on wage increases
as of wednesday kaiser permanente offered wage increases of in the first three years of the new contract and in the final year to all unionized employees
the coalition has not accepted the offer asking for a increase in the first two years of the contract and a increase in the final two years
however kaiser has not agreed to increase minimum pay for unionized employees from per hour in some states to the union s demand of per hour
rocio chacon a striking kaiser worker who serves on the union s negotiating committee said many employees cannot afford to live in the cities where they work due to the rising cost of living and some workers resort to sleeping in their cars
as we speak there are nurses that are sleeping in their cars because of two reasons
one they can t afford cost of living here so they have to move two three hours away and then because of short staff they re working hours so they re tired chacon said
so their best choice is to be monday through friday in their cars
in a statement kaiser permanente said it is a leader in pay
we lead total compensation in every market where we operate and our proposals in bargaining would ensure we keep that position a spokesperson for kaiser permanente said in a statement
in some places like in southern california a kaiser permanente employee leaving for a similar job at another organization would on average face a plus percent pay cut and lower benefits
the unprecedented strike comes at a time of heightened labor activity across the united states with tens of thousands of workers across multiple industries taking to picket lines for better pay and benefits
in the wake of the pandemic health care workers in particular have been fighting for safer and more secure work environments
this is the first ever national strike effort at kaiser permanente
