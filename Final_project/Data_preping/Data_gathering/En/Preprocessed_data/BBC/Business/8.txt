from actors to autoworkers more than workers have participated in strikes in the united states this year according to cornell university s labor action tracker
are all of these workers missing from the us government s monthly jobs reports
the report produced by the bureau of labor statistics is a product of two different surveys
one asks a sample group of employers to report how many workers they employed based on their payroll records for the pay period that includes the th of the month
data from that survey is used to determine how many people were hired or laid off in a given month
uaw says it scored a major concession from gm and will not expand its big three strike friday
if the striking workers earned pay for any part of the reference period even one hour they are counted as employed cody parkinson an economist at the bls told cnn
striking workers are reflected as a subtraction from the employment level in the first monthly estimate when they are not working in the reference pay period
they are added back only when they return to work
that means that in the september jobs report united auto workers members on strike are counted as employed since the strike began on september which was during the reference week
but if the strike continues through the end of next week they will not be counted as employed in the october jobs report due next month unless they are on the payroll of a different employer
in contrast the impact of the sag aftra strike which began in july showed up in some of the data that was included in the september jobs report
employment in motion picture and sound recording industries continued to trend down and has declined by since may reflecting the impact of labor disputes the bls noted in the september jobs report
in the case of the writers guild of america strike which recently ended many of the union members were contract workers or freelancers
so you wouldn t be able to see the impact of strikes simply by looking at industry hiring data that comes from payroll data
however there s another survey used to construct the monthly jobs report that asks individuals if they worked in a given week
data from that survey is used to calculate the unemployment rate
since the survey captures almost all types of working arrangements contractors and freelancers on strike would impact the data
the fed cares a lot about jobs data but it may be getting mixed signals
the bls classifies someone as unemployed if they were not working but were available to work and actively looked for work in the prior weeks
if the answer to that is no they aren t considered part of the labor force even if they are part of a striking union
if someone was on strike but earned money working a different way like driving for uber during the reference period they d be counted as employed
finally a worker who was on strike for the entire reference period and did not have a job would be counted as employed but not at work due to a labor dispute parkinson said
