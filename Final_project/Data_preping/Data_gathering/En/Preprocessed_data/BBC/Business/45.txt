This time last week the prospects seemed to be growing dimmer that the September jobs report would land this Friday as planned
A government shutdown would have forced the Bureau of Labor Statistics to go dark and result in the blackout of critical economic data
But after a last-minute deal in Washington the key labor market data is now set to flow as it should
Whether it ultimately meets expectations is another question entirely Closely watched economic data released earlier this week indicate that Friday’s jobs report could come in hot or perhaps frigidly cold
US job openings unexpectedly grew in August
On Tuesday the latest tally on job openings unexpectedly bolted higher jolting markets in the process
A day later ADP’s national employment report showed that private-sector employers scaled back their hiring efforts far more than expected
Come Friday at am ET economists are forecasting that employers added jobs last month according to Refinitiv data
While that is a definite step back from the estimated jobs added in August it’s only slightly below pre-pandemic levels
From to the US added jobs per month on average
Economists also estimate that the unemployment rate will inch back down to from
The labor market still is solid Nela Richardson chief economist with payroll processor ADP told CNN in an interview
It’s slowing but there is no indication that it’s breaking
For much of the past months the unemployment rate has drifted between and a historically low range that stood in defiance to the barrage of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and expectations for increased joblessness
In August the unemployment rate unexpectedly jumped percentage points to
And while monthly data and the unemployment rate itself can be quite volatile a driver behind the increase was a welcome one an increase in labor force participation
The US economy continued to add jobs at a robust pace last month
How much of that was noise said Nick Bunker head of economic research for the Indeed Hiring Lab adding that if monthly job gains remain north of how many more people can that pull into the labor force
Labor force participation plummeted during the early stages of the pandemic when the economy started reopening consumer demand and businesses’ needs far outstripped available workers
Some of the labor force declines were due to increased early retirements deaths and long-Covid health issues in addition to low immigration lack of access to childcare and increased caregiving responsibilities
Additionally as the pandemic laid bare workplace concerns such as low pay and safe working conditions as well as highlighted the fleeting nature of life the Great Reshuffling took hold as Americans switched jobs or careers to achieve better work-life balance
During the past year more people have returned to the labor force
The overall labor force participation rate rose to in August BLS data shows
That’s the highest it’s been since the onset of the pandemic
How much higher it can climb is unknown Even before Covid was in play labor force participation was trending downward largely due to the massive Baby Boomer generation aging out of the workforce
Is there an immaculate rebalancing and can job openings drop and can labor force participation rise at the same time Bunker asked noting that the latter likely doesn’t have enough power to fight back against the extremely powerful force of demographics
The Fed cares a lot about jobs data — but it may be getting mixed signals
Additionally Bunker said he’s keeping a close eye on wage growth trends that have been showing a deceleration
Things are no longer ‘frothy’ as they were in and he said
We’re in a moderation not a deterioration
To that end economists also will be looking closely at the revisions made
Federal data is fluid and frequently subject to change as more detailed and accurate information becomes readily available
The Labor Department’s monthly jobs report is based upon survey responses from employers across a wide swath of industries
Those initial estimates are then revised twice more
For eight consecutive months however the gains have been revised downward
Many are interpreting this streak of downward revisions as a sign that we could be at an inflection point and that the labor market could be weakening even more rapidly than the official data suggests said Julia Pollak senior economist with ZipRecruiter
While Friday’s report will deliver a host of critical info about the nation’s job market one of the biggest stories in labor might not be fully on display
There are more than United Auto Workers union members on strike at Detroit’s Big Three automakers of Ford General Motors and Stellantis and more than members have been laid off or furloughed to date
While some of the impacts are starting to be seen at local workforce centers and in state unemployment claims the effects of the UAW strike will be largely muted in Friday’s jobs report economists say
The UAW strike started on September which is at the tail end of the reference periods for both of the surveys that make up the monthly employment report
The reference periods for the household and establishment surveys are generally the calendar week that includes the th day of the month and the pay period that includes the th day of the month respectively
Autoworkers strike expands again against GM and Ford
Workers who worked or received pay for that pay period even if it’s just for minutes are counted as employed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
We won’t see the direct impact probably until the October jobs report Bunker told CNN
Separately the SAG-AFTRA strike involving actors should not have a noticeable impact on the information sector as striking employees were already counted as unemployed in the August jobs report noted Lydia Boussour EY’s senior economist
Overall there were only net new workers on strike in September according to the latest BLS strike report she said
Still the UAW strike could have ripple effects on employment outside of the Big Three as other companies within or ancillary to the auto industry could lay off workers as a result of slowing or canceled orders
However while relatively undetectable in the upcoming jobs report the effects of the strikes are already showing up in key government data
The jobless claims report issued last week showed a spike in unemployment in Michigan for the week ended September
That’s expected to grow when last week’s data is released on Thursday morning
University of Michigan economist Don Grimes estimated that Michigan could lose up to jobs by the end of the week and that UAW-related job loss nationwide could grow to people he told the Detroit Free Press
The effects of the UAW strike did appear to show up in Challenger Gray Christmas’ monthly job cuts report which was released Thursday morning
In September US-based employers announced job cuts of which or nearly were attributed to labor dispute as a cause
The total announced layoffs last month were below those announced in August and are up from September according to the Challenger report
Last year and were historically low years for layoffs as the US labor market surged to backfill the more than million jobs lost at the outset of the pandemic
US consumer prices continued to rise last month — but the Fed probably won't raise rates
Despite the pullback the job cut announcements made so far this year are nearly triple that of the same period last year and are the highest they have been for data through September going back to excluding
Employers are grappling with inflation rate increases labor issues and consumer demand as we enter the fourth quarter said Andrew Challenger senior vice president of the outplacement firm in a statement
First-time claims for unemployment a proxy for layoffs have remained low in recent months and continued to do so last week
The number of Americans filing for first-time jobless benefits held steady last week near yearly low levels the Department of Labor reported Thursday
Initial claims for unemployment insurance considered a proxy for layoffs were for the week ended September
That’s down claims from the previous week’s revised total of claims
The weekly filings were roughly in line with economists’ estimates of initial claims according to Refinitiv estimates
Weekly jobless claims which are highly volatile and frequently revised remain below historical and pre-pandemic averages exemplifying the strength of the job market
In the decade before the pandemic weekly claims for unemployment benefits averaged and in they averaged Labor Department data shows
Continuing claims which are filed by people who have received unemployment benefits for more than one week were million for the week ended September
That’s down claims from the prior week’s downwardly revised total of million
Economists were expecting million continuing claims according to Refinitiv
