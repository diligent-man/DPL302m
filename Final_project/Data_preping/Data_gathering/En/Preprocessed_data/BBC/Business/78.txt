with extremely cold temperatures gripping much of the united states travelers may be wondering how their planes are made safe for flying
the short answer along with regular deicing of planes before take off airlines put their aircraft through rigorous testing in some of the coldest places on the planet before they are ever pressed into service
cnn has previously followed a team of airbus engineers mechanics and test pilots
their mission was to see how their test plane a long range a xwb withstood extreme cold
the airbus team left the warmth and comfort of their toulouse france base to perform various extreme weather trials on the test plane in frigid iqaluit the capital of canada s eastern arctic territory of nunavut
the ground and in air tests included operating the a xwb in temperatures reaching down to fahrenheit degrees celsius thrust reversed tests with snow and a local flight test
all new plane models must be tested in extreme environmental conditions from freezing to intense heat
coming to an extreme place means we can break everything airbus head of flight operations pedro dias told local reporters
extreme cold affects various parts of an aircraft in different ways
metals such as steel and aluminum contract at different rates
lubricants may lose their viscosity creating friction and wear issues for moving parts
meanwhile plastic and rubber parts could become brittle
the cold weather tests in canada came only days after the msn test plane completed high altitude test in bolivia
next stop was qatar for hot weather testing
for years iqaluit located on baffin island has marketed itself as a premier cold weather test site
airbus has tested there since the s while the airport has also hosted other civilian and military aircraft makers such as boeing dassault and eurocopter to perform similar trials
but cold weather test sites also appear in unlikely places
four million parts countries how an airbus a comes together
in april boeing chose mckinley climatic laboratory in florida as the location for extreme weather testing on its dreamliner
in a test chamber the aircraft was given a cold soak and exposed to temperatures as low as degrees fahrenheit degrees celsius for hours
later it had to endure temperatures as high as degrees fahrenheit degrees celsius also for hours
these tests help us establish that our customers will get airplanes that work for them in all of the climates in which they operate around the globe and in all seasons randy tinseth vice president of marketing at boeing commercial airplanes said in a news release
but extreme weather trials are also affected by unpredictability of mother nature
initially scheduled for five days airbus tests in iqaluit were cut short not because of an impending winter blizzard but because of a balmy temperature of degrees celsius too warm for the cold weather testing
