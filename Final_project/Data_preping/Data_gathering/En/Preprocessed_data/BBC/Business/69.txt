marty baron the renowned executive editor of the washington post who led the newspaper during eight tumultuous years in american politics and media published his anticipated memoir this week offering readers an urgent exploration of the nature of power in the st century
in the book titled collision of power trump bezos and the washington post baron recounts his time and challenges leading the legendary newspaper under the ownership of billionaire jeff bezos and while under sustained assault from then president donald trump
baron s book comes at a perilous moment for american democracy and the news media tasked with covering its erosion
on wednesday baron participated in a q a with cnn on the consequential issues the industry faces
below is the conversation printed in full
do you believe that news organizations broadly speaking are meeting the moment in terms of covering the chaos that the republican party is inflicting on america
i think the coverage of the latest chaos has been very good based on what i ve read
it portrays the republican party as chaos central which it is
the party is proving to be ungovernable and that is wreaking havoc on the country as a whole
the bigger issue is trump
i d like to see substantially more coverage of what a second trump administration would do upon taking office
who would be put in cabinet posts who would be put in charge of regulatory agencies
no doubt trump would embark on an immediate campaign of vengeance
plans are already in the works
what would that mean for the fbi doj the courts the press really for all the institutional pillars of our democracy some stories have been produced though not enough in my view
those sorts of stories would serve the public better than yet another interview with trump himself
look the party that now levels evidence free charges of weaponization of government openly boasts of how it would weaponize government against its perceived enemies
are newsrooms being clear eyed enough with their audiences about the reality of the gop in or do you believe that language used in stories gets watered down and journalists are still too often falling into the both sides trap in their efforts to appear neutral
i wouldn t want to generalize
some stories are admirably accurate clear and forthright in their language
others are not
the important thing though is that the stories make absolutely clear what s true and what s false giving those proper weight and that we show the public the evidence
if news organizations believe donald trump is a threat to democracy and the country s framework of government should they remain totally neutral in covering his candidacy
there s evidence aplenty that trump is an aspiring authoritarian
he has talked openly about suspending the constitution
he has talked openly about using the military to suppress legitimate protests
he has suggested that someone like mark milley should be executed
he has called for prosecuting nbc for treason
he continues to use language that excuses and is likely to incite violence against his political opponents
he has called for shutting down the government as a way to end federal prosecutions directed at him
these are unmistakable signals of the sort of presidency he intends to have and the coverage needs to make that clear
that s just being accurate based on a mountain of evidence which again we need to show in full
how would you describe fox news do you believe it should be treated as a serious news organization or a propaganda arm of the gop
well it s a media outlet though diminishingly a news organization
there s certainly little serious news coverage
it has routinely spread baseless even bizarre conspiracy theories
i know you ve argued for at least calling it right wing and i d say that s an entirely sound recommendation or saying that it s tightly aligned with the republican party
the defamation suit by dominion voting certainly documented just how close the relationship is even beyond what was already known
what do you believe is the toughest challenge running a major newsroom in
covering the nation s radioactive politics fairly honestly honorably and rigorously but also aggressively and unflinchingly without becoming partisans and engaging in performative outrage
the gop is a mess and trump s agenda and that of his close allies and enablers is a threat to democracy
but the democratic party has its own issues and there are plenty of democratic politicians who deserve close scrutiny
robert menendez is the latest standout example
how do you think news organizations should approach ai
generative ai poses huge risks but also offers some intriguing opportunities
i think we re all familiar with the risks especially when ai pulls so called information out of the ether
the result is what are typically called hallucinations more appropriately they should be called fabrications
but there are ways to introduce some efficiencies in newsroom operations with the careful use of generative ai
reporters and editors are burdened with all sorts of tasks they didn t have to perform in a previous era search and social friendly headlines photo selection metadata alerts multiple versions of stories throughout the day and the list goes on
the use of ai that draws upon a news organization s own archival content and fresh reporting by its own staff can potentially help immensely in time management for reporters and editors
do you think that newsrooms and journalists should remain on twitter x especially given that owner elon musk has smeared most major media outlets and made the website a haven for conspiracy theories and hate speech
i m not an active user and i certainly wouldn t pay to be verified
and as is well known i feel journalists should exercise great care and restraint in their social media posts
i wouldn t advocate abandoning twitter x altogether
it can still be useful
but i think it s advisable for journalists to moderate their use of it for all sorts of reasons with only one of them being the ever more odious drift in its content and leadership
