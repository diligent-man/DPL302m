Gen Xers are now in their s and s and account for about a fifth of the US population As the next generation in line to retire behind the Baby Boomers their experience may be a cautionary tale for those coming up behind them
A recent report from the National Institute on Retirement Security suggests that many Gen Xers simply aren t building enough savings to maintain their standard of living when they retire
The data pretty clearly indicates that the system we have in place now will not provide adequate income for many workers said Tyler Bond NIRS research director and coauthor of The Forgotten Generation Generation X Approaches Retirement
The system Bond refers to is the mostly do it yourself model of saving for retirement that came of age when Gen Xers did They were the first generation to enter the labor market after the shift from employer run defined benefit pension plans to k style defined contribution accounts
Traditional pension plans are pretty rare But here's who still has them and how they work
While the oldest Gen X adults are more likely than younger ones to have at least some pension income to supplement their own savings and Social Security benefits in retirement most will not
Specifically only of working Gen X adults are in a defined benefit pension plan according to the NIRS report which analyzed data from the federal Survey of Income and Program Participation
As for savings in workplace retirement plans and IRAs the bottom half of Gen X earners have only a few thousand dollars saved authors of the NIRS report wrote And the median amount that Gen X households have in retirement savings meaning half have less half have more is just
Income is the single biggest factor in determining who has built savings and who has not Retirement savings for Generation X is highly concentrated among the highest earners the report notes
Nevertheless the average Gen X retirement savings balance nearly for individuals and for households suggests that many higher earners may not be saving enough if those savings are intended to be one s main source of income in retirement That is a likely scenario for many since most people won t have a pension and Social Security benefits for high earners whose career average earnings range roughly between and in Social Security s model is intended to replace only between a quarter to a third of one s income if one retires at full retirement age which is for Gen Xers
Keep in mind too that Social Security benefits for some might ultimately be reduced since lawmakers have yet to address the program s long term solvency Current projections suggest that if no action is taken Social Security will only be able to pay of promised benefits by which is when Gen Xers will have begun retiring
While higher earners across all groups do better than lower earners looking specifically through the lens of race and ethnicity among employed Gen Xers Black and Hispanic workers have the lowest savings accumulations and are the least likely to have access to and participate in employer sponsored retirement plans
The average retirement account balance is for Black workers and for Hispanic workers while their medians are and zero respectively according to the report By contrast the averages are for White workers and for Asian workers and their medians are and respectively
Across the board however most Gen Xers regardless of race gender marital status or income are failing to meet retirement savings targets the report notes
Interest rates are high These are the best places to park your cash
Setting benchmark targets can be tricky since each person s circumstance is different and may change over the years for better or worse But one broad recommendation suggests that by age one should have saved two to four times one s household income three to six times by age and four and a half to eight times by
How much any individual should have saved by retirement depends on many factors including what age they retire their marital status where and how they plan to live whether they will have a steady monthly paycheck from a pension how much they can expect from Social Security and how much may come from other potential income sources in retirement such as part time work or a rental property
If you are a Gen Xer concerned that you won t have enough in retirement there are some things you can do today along with some benefits available now and coming online in a few years that may help
Assess where you stand Figure out what likely sources of income and income producing assets will be available to you in retirement For instance you can request a benefits estimate here to determine what Social Security may pay you based on your earnings to date Your k provider such as Fidelity Vanguard or T Rowe Price likely has calculators online to help you assess if you re on track to have adequate savings in retirement
Determine what changes you can make Whether it is saving more planning to retire later and or postpone taking your Social Security benefits to age to get a larger monthly check now is a good time to figure what levers you can pull to improve your financial situation in the future
If you can afford it you may get helpful guidance too from a fee only certified financial planner or a financial adviser who has a stated fiduciary responsibility to serve your interests only and who is not paid a commission to put clients money in specific investment products Or check to see if your employer has an employee assistance program EAP that offers free or subsidized financial coaching
Stay informed about new programs and benefits Nineteen states and counting have introduced new programs to make saving easier for workers and the self employed who don t have access to a workplace retirement plan Most take the form of an auto IRA contribution model which provides an easy tax advantaged way to save and invest for retirement through automatic deductions from their paycheck The rules differ by state but some allow employers to make contributions to their employees accounts
Many employers will soon have to advertise salary thanks to two new laws
Two recently enacted federal laws meanwhile are intended to help working adults save more and get access to workplace retirement plans They are the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement SECURE Act of and SECURE which was enacted last year
One provision that may be especially helpful to Gen Xers who work part time many of whom are women is a requirement that employers must grant a part time worker access to the company retirement plan if that employee worked at least hours per year for two consecutive years
Also changes to an existing Saver s Credit may help lower income Gen Xers The Saver s Credit will become a Saver s Match beginning in and significantly it will become refundable meaning a tax filer will not have to have a tax liability in order to claim the match the NIRS report notes The Saver s Match will equal percent of a tax filer s retirement plan contribution up to a maximum match of and the match will be deposited directly into the filer s retirement plan account
