the average us mortgage rate hit this week the highest level in years
but the rate you may be able to secure from a lender could be very different
it could either be a good bit higher than the current average or lower
it all depends on the financial attributes and risks that you present lenders as a borrower
while average rates in the range that homebuyers secured over the past few years are not coming back any time soon mortgage rates also aren t expected to rival the sky high rates of the s which surged to almost amid inflation
but your rate may vary from the published average weekly rates
here s what goes into determining it
your mortgage rate is based on a calculation the lender makes on how likely you are as a borrower to pay them back
it s an approach called risk based pricing that determines how much you ll have to pay the lender for the loan
the lower risk you present the lower your mortgage rate will be
among some fairly well known positive attributes
this is one of the biggest determinants to lowering your mortgage rate
borrowers who are able pay of a mortgage also known as a mortgage with a loan to value of are considered to be lower risk borrowers because they immediately have more skin in the game
borrowers whose down payment is less than are likely to pay a higher rate
more remote workers are willing to move in order to find affordable housing
the applications examined by freddie mac to determine its average weekly mortgage rate are limited to conforming loans with a down payment so they are automatically going to be lower rates than a wider population of borrowers who put down less

the typical down payment for a repeat buyer likely using equity from a home sold was higher at
if any of the other measures mentioned above are deemed to be weak the mortgage applicant can expect to pay a higher rate
also as borrowers move down in fico scores those considered sub prime by the industry often due to having limited or no credit history are viewed as more risky and can expect to be charged a higher mortgage rate if they are approved to borrow at all
a recent analysis of mortgages from showed that mortgage application denials increased over the past year largely because of insufficient income
younger buyers may have too short of an employment history or work history that is too uneven to qualify for lower rates
you don t have to settle for the first offer you receive
if you think you can do better shop around and get quotes from a variety of lenders like a bank a credit union or an online lender
another way people who are quoted a certain mortgage rate can lower it is by buying down the rate with discount points
this is akin to prepaying your interest
home affordability is the worst it has been since
typically each point is equal to of the borrower s mortgage cost
paying point brings the rate down by about
a borrower with a loan can buy down a mortgage rate to for
by reducing the mortgage rate upfront the monthly costs will be smaller for the life of the loan
also while it doesn t necessarily reduce your interest rate putting more money down will reduce the overall size of your loan and that can reduce your monthly payments

the law also prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants who ve received income from a public assistance program or because an applicant has exercised any right under the consumer credit protection act
beyond that there are some added protections for consumers that are intended to provide transparency about a lender s credit decisions due to the fair credit reporting act
homeowners are tapping into their home equity to get cash
according to the law the risk based pricing rule requires lenders to notify consumers if they are getting worse terms based on information in their credit report
companies and lenders do this in various ways
many provide disclosures to all customers that decisions based on a person s credit report impact the terms and rate offered
in addition if a lender denies a loan application based on information in a consumer report the lender must provide an adverse action notice to the consumer to explain the reason for the denial
a borrower can then know what area of their financial profile that needs improvement so they might be approved the next time
