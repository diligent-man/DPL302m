that s according to a new survey from human resources consulting firm mercer
the survey was taken by more than of its clients who are employers of varying sizes across industries
based on their replies mercer said compensation budgets for merit increases are expected to grow by an average of in down from this year
merit increases are the pay bumps related to your prior year s performance
many employers will soon have to advertise salary thanks to two new laws
meanwhile budgets for total salary increases for non union employees are expected to go up by on average down from this year
these include both merit increases and base pay increases due to promotions and other reasons such as minimum wage adjustments or off cycle raises which may be offered to do things like retain someone if a competitor tries to hire them away
