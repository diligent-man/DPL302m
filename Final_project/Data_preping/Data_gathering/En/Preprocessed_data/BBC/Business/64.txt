attorneys representing conspiracy theorist mike lindell and his company mypillow in a defamation lawsuits brought by dominion voting systems and smartmatic have asked to withdraw from both cases after lindell allegedly racked up millions in unpaid legal fees
in a court filings minnesota based parker daniels kibort said both lindell and mypillow have not paid the firm for its work on the case and won t be able to pay future fees and costs
on october the law firm was informed by defendants that they are not able to get caught up with or make any payment on the large amount they owe in arrears nor pay for anywhere near the estimated expense of continuing to defend against the lawsuits going forward including either the legal fees or litigation costs the filing stated
in an interview with cnn on thursday lindell acknowledged he has not paid the attorneys for the last two or three months adding that he did not know who would next represent him in the case
but lindell was adamant that he would not settle with dominion or smartmatic another election technology company suing him for defamation
not in a million years he said
dominion the election technology company that has been the subject of debunked right wing conspiracy theories about voting fraud in the election sued mypillow and lindell in for billion over his repeated allegations that dominion rigged its machines to hand joe biden a victory over donald trump
smartmatic similarly sued lindell for defamation alleging that he lied about the firm s role in the election for his own financial gain
mypillow a prolific advertiser on the right wing cable channel fox news which also promoted the false election conspiracy theories began losing money following dominion s lawsuit to such an extent that mypillow is unable to pay their legal bills today lindell told cnn
lindell and mypillow who were notified of their attorneys intent to withdraw on thursday said they would not oppose the move and understand the need to withdraw due to the lack of funds the court filing shows
the court must grant the attorneys motion to withdraw before they can formally drop lindell and mypillow as clients
attorneys for dominion did not have a position regarding the motion when it was filed the court filing shows
dominion and smartmatic did not immediately respond to a cnn request for comment
speaking on steve bannon s war room program on thursday lindell blamed his financial troubles on attacks on mypillow that had been devastating to the company s credit
i can t pay the lawyers

there s no money left to pay them he said
i don t know where that leaves us
