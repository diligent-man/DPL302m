In the world’s first passenger train went into service in northern England
It heralded the start of a railway age that transformed the country’s economy by slashing journey times boosting trade routes and connecting major cities
Fast-forward two centuries and the United Kingdom has just abandoned its plan — years in the making — for a high-speed railway network connecting London with the north of England
That puts the UK at a serious disadvantage compared with most of the world’s other advanced economies many of which enjoy the benefits — financial and environmental — of high-speed rail
Britain makes drastic cuts to giant HS rail project
The decision by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to halt High Speed Two HS in its tracks because of spiraling costs is just the latest example of Britain’s economic decline and it confirms a painful reality the country can apparently no longer spend big on the kind of projects that Germany France and Italy never mind China or Japan are still able to deliver
My great-great-grandfather was one of the drivers on Flying Scotsman — at the time the fastest steam train in the world — during a record-breaking trip in from London to Edinburgh so I feel oddly saddened by the decision to cancel plans to build the Birmingham-to-Manchester high-speed line
The leg to Leeds had already been scrapped
Granted there will be some compensation for northern towns and cities that will miss out on the jobs the mammoth building project would have brought not to mention the business investment that speedier passenger and freight train travel would have attracted
Sunak said £ billion billion in savings would be redirected to new transport projects in the English midlands the north of the UK and elsewhere
Our plan will drive far more growth and opportunity here in the north than a faster train to London ever would he said Wednesday
But a thriving economy may not have had to choose between the two and the new projects will take years to develop let alone deliver
Some of the alternatives Sunak highlighted were predicated on the delivery of HS said Henrietta Bailey CEO of Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce
The UK economy is bigger than we thought
Sunak’s latest reverse-course on a strategic initiative — a year ago he was committed to HS — has managed to unite business leaders labor unions and some of his political allies including former Conservative prime ministers in condemnation of the decision
They have also warned of a loss of credibility with investors
This is the biggest and most damaging U-turn in the history of UK infrastructure the High Speed Rail Group which represents companies such as Siemens Hitachi and Bombardier said in a statement
Every other major European country has managed to build a high-speed rail network recognizing it’s a vital part of a modern society and economy for years to come
We’d like to think Britain still could too
British manufacturers are mourning the loss of income they could have earned from the project and future business opportunities
The decision … sends a hugely disappointing message about our commitment to completing major infrastructure projects in the UK said Stephen Phipson chief executive of Make UK which represents manufacturing firms
Mark Allen chief executive of property group Landsec said the root of the issue was less about the specifics of what HS will or won’t bring to the economy
It’s more what that says about our ability or lack of ability as a country to deliver major infrastructure projects
Sunak has worked hard to restore the UK’s credibility since it was trashed this time last year when his predecessor — Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister Liz Truss — crashed the pound and UK government bonds
Investors threw her plan for huge unfunded tax cuts back in her face
Now he’s having his own date with reality
After the UK Treasury poured money into the economy to prop up businesses and households through the pandemic and the energy crisis — giveaways that Sunak oversaw as finance minister — its cupboard is bare
Since the pandemic struck in March UK government debt has surged by to almost £ trillion trillion exceeding of national income for the first time since the early s
And the nature of that debt is piling on the agony Almost a quarter of it is tied to inflation
As prices shot up last year so did repayments
Why inflation makes Britain's debt the costliest among rich economies
Britain spends more to service its debt than any other developed economy as a percentage of government revenue and borrowing costs are increasing again
The yield on -year government bonds or gilts hit its highest level in years this week higher even than during Truss’s tenure
The UK remains trapped in what its fiscal watchdog described earlier this year as a very risky era for the public finances
With crumbling public services from health to education desperate for more cash and an election looming Sunak blinked taking the machete to billions in costs when a scalpel would no longer do
The country must hope that his latest policy reversal doesn’t deter investors and further undermine a struggling UK economy perpetuating a doom-loop of weak growth and underinvestment
James Mason chief executive of the chamber of commerce for West and North Yorkshire said a decade of promises that would have delivered life-changing infrastructure upgrades had been canceled at a stroke
We are now left with the same Victorian rail network that will simply not have the capacity to deal with demand over the coming decades
