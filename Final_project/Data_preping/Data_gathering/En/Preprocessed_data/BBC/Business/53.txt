the system bond refers to is the mostly do it yourself model of saving for retirement that came of age when gen xers did
they were the first generation to enter the labor market after the shift from employer run defined benefit pension plans to k style defined contribution accounts

but here s who still has them and how they work
while the oldest gen x adults are more likely than younger ones to have at least some pension income to supplement their own savings and social security benefits in retirement most will not
specifically only of working gen x adults are in a defined benefit pension plan according to the nirs report which analyzed data from the federal survey of income and program participation
as for savings in workplace retirement plans and iras the bottom half of gen x earners have only a few thousand dollars saved authors of the nirs report wrote
and the median amount that gen x households have in retirement savings meaning half have less half have more is just
income is the single biggest factor in determining who has built savings and who has not
retirement savings for generation x is highly concentrated among the highest earners the report notes
nevertheless the average gen x retirement savings balance nearly for individuals and for households suggests that many higher earners may not be saving enough if those savings are intended to be one s main source of income in retirement
that is a likely scenario for many since most people won t have a pension and social security benefits for high earners whose career average earnings range roughly between and in social security s model is intended to replace only between a quarter to a third of one s income if one retires at full retirement age which is for gen xers
keep in mind too that social security benefits for some might ultimately be reduced since lawmakers have yet to address the program s long term solvency
current projections suggest that if no action is taken social security will only be able to pay of promised benefits by which is when gen xers will have begun retiring
while higher earners across all groups do better than lower earners looking specifically through the lens of race and ethnicity among employed gen xers black and hispanic workers have the lowest savings accumulations and are the least likely to have access to and participate in employer sponsored retirement plans
the average retirement account balance is for black workers and for hispanic workers while their medians are and zero respectively according to the report
by contrast the averages are for white workers and for asian workers and their medians are and respectively

setting benchmark targets can be tricky since each person s circumstance is different and may change over the years for better or worse
but one broad recommendation suggests that by age one should have saved two to four times one s household income three to six times by age and four and a half to eight times by
how much any individual should have saved by retirement depends on many factors including what age they retire their marital status where and how they plan to live whether they will have a steady monthly paycheck from a pension how much they can expect from social security and how much may come from other potential income sources in retirement such as part time work or a rental property
