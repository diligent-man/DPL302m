latest market news
after spiking to alarming levels just last week oil prices are suddenly in free fall mode
the dramatic reversal should bring relief to drivers and nervous central bankers very soon
us oil prices plunged by to a barrel on wednesday marking the biggest one day decline in a year
crude dropped even further thursday sinking as low as a barrel a five week low
this is quite the u turn even for the notoriously boom to bust oil market
as recently as last week us crude briefly touched a barrel and wall street banks were predicting or higher amid saudi arabia and russia s aggressive supply cuts
now gas prices are already starting to retreat and experts predict sharper drops to come
the national average for regular gas dipped to a gallon on thursday according to aaa
that s cents below the peak set last month when gas prices experienced an unusual post labor day jump
oil surges above a barrel for the first time in a year as stockpiles shrink
gas prices will tumble to nearly a gallon nationally over the next few weeks andy lipow president of consulting firm lipow oil associates told cnn
tom kloza global head of energy analysis at the oil price information service told cnn he expects an even bigger tumble to as low as a gallon by halloween
pointing to sinking wholesale prices kloza said retail prices should drop each day by between cents and cents a gallon going forward
people at cocktail parties will finally be talking about gas prices in a good way kloza said in a phone interview
no doubt it s welcome news for the consumer portion of the economy
such a drop in gas prices would mark a significant break for consumers exhausted by the high cost of living and soaring borrowing costs
it would also come as a relief to officials inside the white house and federal reserve who nervously watched the recent jump in oil prices and considered the damage it could do to consumer confidence and inflation
indeed the recent jump in gasoline prices almost single handedly caused inflation to heat up last month
gas price disinflation is probably going to be the story for the rest of the year kloza said
joe brusuelas chief economist at rsm wrote in a report on wednesday that the drop in oil and gasoline prices will help convince the fed to keep interest rates steady at its next meeting which concludes on november
so why did oil prices go from spiking to plunging
some argue that oil bulls including hedge funds had become excessively bullish
egged on by saudi arabia s supply cuts they piled in to make bets that prices would go higher and higher even though fundamentals didn t justify it
a lot of speculative pressure is being let out of the tires said matt smith lead oil analyst for the americas at kpler
it was stretched taut like a rubber band hence a couple of bearish triggers caused price to snap back in short sharp fashion smith said
america s emergency oil reserve is at a year low and that could inflate oil prices goldman sachs says
the latest trigger was a government report released wednesday that showed gasoline inventories unexpectedly soared last week
that in turn raised concerns about weakening demand for gasoline
kloza dismissed as premature the argument that the weekly government data revealed an ominous plunge in demand that signals underlying weakness in the economy
he said gasoline demand is roughly where it was last year and stressed the weekly numbers can be volatile
of course it s worth noting that the situation in the oil market can change in the blink of an eye as the past week demonstrates
there s always a risk that more aggressive steps by opec to cut supply or disruptions caused by russia s war in ukraine could cause oil and gasoline prices to move higher again
kloza said he is expecting prices at the pump to rebound early next year as demand from drivers returns and refineries struggle to keep up
enjoy the next four or five months kloza said and then be prepared for the roller coaster to go back up next spring
