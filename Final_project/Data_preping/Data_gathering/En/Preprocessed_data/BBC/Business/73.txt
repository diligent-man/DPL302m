it s proposal season and engagements are on the rise
so are factory made diamond sales
not that you d know the difference
man made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones
the only noticeable difference is the price tag
the result is really stunning said edahn golan an independent diamond industry analyst
he said march data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped compared to last year while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined in the same period
going back by another month to february the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more to compared to a year earlier while the number fell by for natural diamond engagement rings
the big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab grown diamonds in engagement rings he said
too late
it s actually happening
why are consumers flocking to man made diamonds cost is the most obvious reason
the average retail price of the most popular one carat round man made diamond for an engagement ring in march was golan said
this is substantially less as much as cheaper than a natural diamond of the same size cut and clarity as the man made diamond which would cost he said
plus the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone
weddings are booming again
they re bigger and more expensive than ever
a lab diamond is a real diamond but maybe it took a few weeks to make it said golan
natural diamonds were formed over million to three billion years and there isn t an infinite supply of them
this makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive and prices are likely to rise as russia s invasion of ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds
the sanctions directly target alrosa partly owned by the russian government which the us government identified as the world s largest diamond mining company accounting for of global diamond output
key supply of diamonds caught up in russia sanctions
man made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them said dan moran a third generation diamond expert and owner of la based fine jeweler concierge diamonds
moran said the typical buyer of man made diamonds is typically younger than and very budget conscious
mined diamonds have a controversial history that s tied to the use of child labor in some african diamond mines as well as sales of illegally traded conflict diamonds that fund conflict in war torn areas
among millennials and gen z their eco conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non traditional engagement rings according to a report from wedding planning website the knot
although its slice is growing the market share for man made diamonds remains relatively small
currently about of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man made diamonds up from in said golan
some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man made diamonds mainstream
in the world s largest jewelry company pandora
pandy made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab created diamonds in its jewelry
pandora said it s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it
signet
sig the largest jewelry company in the united states which owns zales kay jewelers and jared chains called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its march earnings call with analysts
calling it a fast growing category in its jewelry portfolio signet ceo virginia drosos told analysts that lab created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year
the company said it has expanded its man made bridal jewelry selection in both its zales and kay jewelers stores in response to the increased demand
fine jewelry brand charles and colvard which makes lab created diamonds said consumers don t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing they also want to feel good about it
as the momentum for conscious consumerism grows the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn t surprising said don o connell president and ceo of charles colvard
consumers want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they re conflict free
they re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values
lab grown diamond brand vrai said the pandemic too has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues
it said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits as well as the companies and industries they are supporting
there is however one important consideration for anyone buying lab created diamonds man made diamonds have little resale value
so while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety someone with a trained eye can said golan
once a stone is identified as a factory diamond even though you paid a lot less for it you also won t get much for it
but the value of a ring isn t just monetary
as a professional in the industry i am asked all the time by people about what i think about a ring they have said moran of concierge jewelers
i always say if you love it be happy with it
an engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love
