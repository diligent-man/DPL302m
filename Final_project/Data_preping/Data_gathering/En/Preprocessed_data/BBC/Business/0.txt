six months after the grassroots amazon labor union scored a historic victory by becoming the first to unionize one of the tech giant s us facilities it now appears to be grappling with setbacks and delays
workers at a california amazon facility withdrew their petition late last week to unionize with the alu just days after the labor group failed to win enough votes to unionize an amazon facility in upstate new york
kayla blado a spokesperson for the national labor relations board confirmed to cnn business on tuesday that the petition for a union election at the ont facility in moreno valley california had been withdrawn
blado added that the petitioner does not have to provide a reason to the nlrb for doing so
the move to withdraw comes roughly two weeks after the petition was submitted per the nlrb s docket of the case
amazon workers vote against forming union in upstate new york dealing setback to grassroots labor group
in an email to cnn business alu president chris smalls played down the significance of the withdrawn petition
the withdrawal isn t nothing to worry about he said
we will be refilling within the next few weeks just as we did with our jfk campaign smalls added referring to the name of the unionized facility in staten island new york
smalls did not offer a reason for the decision to withdraw and potentially refile the petition
since the watershed union win at jfk the alu hasn t seen success with organizing efforts at other amazon facilities
in addition to the amazon workers near albany voting against joining the union last week the alu also failed to win enough votes to unionize a smaller amazon outpost in staten island
moreover amazon has refused to recognize or meet with the union at jfk and continues to challenge the union s election win
labor experts say the saga reveals how difficult it is to organize a union under current labor laws
amazon has long maintained that it prefers working with employees directly versus through a union
after the workers near albany voted against forming a union an amazon spokesperson said the company is glad to see they chose to keep the direct relationship with amazon as we think that this is the best arrangement for both our employees and customers
despite the uphill battle the union faces smalls previously told cnn business that he sees the increase in organizing efforts at amazon facilities across the country as its own victory
the expansion of the alu is definitely historical by itself smalls said
he added that the group has been fielding an explosion of interest from amazon workers across the country since the alu s original win in staten island in april
