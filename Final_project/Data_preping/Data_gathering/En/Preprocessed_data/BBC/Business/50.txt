another said it s only a matter of time before there are as many women as men occupying the top roles
pew compared responses from men and women and from respondents identifying as democrats or republicans
most women and most democrats regardless of gender said there are too few women in business leadership
among all those who said this a large majority said ideally there should be the same number of women and men in these roles
another said more women than men would be ideal and another said it would be ideal to have more women but still not as many women as men
between the major political parties democrats were more likely than republicans to see multiple factors as major obstacles for women seeking top leadership positions in business
but gender overrode political affiliation when it came to citing views on why more women aren t at the top in the business world
