general motors will produce a fully electric chevrolet corvette gm president mark reuss announced in a linkedin post monday morning
reuss didn t say when the electric corvette would come but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon
we will offer an electrified corvette as early as next year he wrote
an accompanying video the company posted to twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid corvette and in another first showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered
all corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear wheel drive only
while reuss s post implies a hybrid corvette will be based on the current generation of the car it s not clear if the all electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model
