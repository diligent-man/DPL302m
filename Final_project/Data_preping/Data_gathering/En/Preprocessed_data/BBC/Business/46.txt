The bond market is back in the doldrums after a promising start to
The US economy and labor market have shown few signs of cracking even after the Federal Reserve’s punishing campaign to tame inflation sent interest rates to their highest level in years
The surprisingly strong economy has led investors to worry that the Fed will keep rates higher for longer which in turn drove US Treasury yields higher
The spike in yields has soured investors’ mood on Wall Street over the past few months after what had been a strong first half of the year for stocks
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index on Tuesday gave up the last of its gains and is now roughly flat for the year
The SP and Nasdaq Composite indexes are still positive for the year but have each fallen about over the past three months
As stocks have declined and bond yields have soared bond prices have tanked causing pain for investors who bet that the Fed would curtail its rate-hiking campaign earlier this year
The iShares Core US Aggregate Bond exchange-traded fund which tracks the performance of US investment-grade bonds is on pace to end lower
If it ends lower for the year that would mark the first time the fund has seen three consecutive annual declines
Investors really came into this year positioned for a recession said Noah Wise senior fixed income portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments
But the economy has stayed strong and expectations that it will accelerate next year as rates stay higher for longer has spurred the surge in yields says Matt Miskin co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management
Rising yields reflect investor confidence in the economy’s growth
Analysts expect growth in earnings year-over-year in according to FactSet
Miskin says expectations that corporate earnings will bounce back to that extent may be overly hopeful
A lagged impact in higher rates is going to lead to weaker growth in the quarters ahead he said
The Fed last month signaled that it will likely raise rates once more this year and keep them elevated through accelerating the surge in yields
Treasury yields rose to their highest level in over a decade earlier this week before edging lower on a cooldown in employment data on Wednesday
A flurry of new government debt issuance has also inundated the bond market pushing prices downward
The US Treasury said in July that it expects to borrow roughly trillion during the third quarter ended in September the largest debt issuance during a third quarter
Bond prices cratered in after the Fed began drastically raising near-zero rates to tame runaway inflation
As new bonds were issued at higher rates the value of old ones fell since they gave holders smaller interest payments and thus lower returns on their investment
That triggered a steep selloff in bonds
US Treasury bond prices jumped earlier this year after the collapse of several regional lenders led traders to bet that the Fed would soon ease its aggressive pace of interest rate hikes
Investors also sought out the safety of virtually risk-free government debt as fears of possible bank contagion swept markets
Wise says that despite the bond market’s seeming optimism about the economy he doesn’t believe a recession is off the table
He expects bonds to become attractive again next year if the economy deteriorates and investors seek less risky assets with high payoff
Next year you’re going to have to think about fundamentals that are going to support a larger allocation to fixed income Wise said
In their opening statements to a newly sworn-in jury in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday lawyers laid out previews of their cases offering two divergent narratives for the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire
Assistant US Attorney Nathan Rehn painted a picture of a villainous greedy businessman whose boundless appetite for wealth and power led him to steal billions of dollars in customer funds reports my colleague Allison Morrow
He had wealth he had power he had influence Rehn said
But all of that — all of it — was built on lies
Rehn reiterated the government’s accusations that Bankman-Fried known as SBF used his crypto exchange FTX as his own personal piggy bank using the money he took from customers to enrich himself and his family buy luxury beachfront property in the Bahamas and funnel millions into US political campaigns
The US government has charged Bankman-Fried with multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy following the implosion of his crypto-trading platform last year
There’s nothing particularly new about Google’s latest-generation Pixel smartphone hardware
That’s why the company is pushing hard to tout its AI-powered new software which Google says was built specifically for the first phone of the generative AI era reports my colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly
At a press event in New York City Google GOOG showed off the new Pixel and Pixel Pro devices which largely look the same as the year prior albeit with more rounded edges
But inside its new G Tensor chip unlocks an AI-powered world aimed at simplifying your life from asking the device to summarize news articles and websites to using Google Assistant to field phone calls and tweaking photos to move or resize objects
The -inch Pixel and the -inch Pixel Pro comes with a brighter display new camera system and longer-lasting battery life
The Pixel is available in three colors — hazel rose and obsidian — and starts at about less than the baseline iPhone with the same amount of storage
That’s about more than last year’s Pixel
Meanwhile the Pixel Pro — which touts a polished aluminum frame and a matte back glass this year — now has the ability to take better low-light photos and sharper selfies
It starts at — the same price as the iPhone Pro — and is available in three colors bay porcelain and obsidian
