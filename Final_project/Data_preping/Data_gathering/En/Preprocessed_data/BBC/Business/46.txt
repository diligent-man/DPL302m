the bond market is back in the doldrums after a promising start to
the us economy and labor market have shown few signs of cracking even after the federal reserve s punishing campaign to tame inflation sent interest rates to their highest level in years
the surprisingly strong economy has led investors to worry that the fed will keep rates higher for longer which in turn drove us treasury yields higher
the spike in yields has soured investors mood on wall street over the past few months after what had been a strong first half of the year for stocks
the dow jones industrial average index on tuesday gave up the last of its gains and is now roughly flat for the year
the s p and nasdaq composite indexes are still positive for the year but have each fallen about over the past three months
as stocks have declined and bond yields have soared bond prices have tanked causing pain for investors who bet that the fed would curtail its rate hiking campaign earlier this year
