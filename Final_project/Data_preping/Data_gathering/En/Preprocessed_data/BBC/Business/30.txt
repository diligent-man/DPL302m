the federal reserve has a complicated decision to make during its next policy meeting which is only a few weeks away
all fed officials agree that inflation needs to be defeated in a timely fashion but they disagree on whether the central bank has already done enough
some officials think the fed must raise interest rates more to tame inflation while others think the rate tightening that s been done will continue to further ease rising prices
it takes around a year for the fed s actions to be felt across the economy
san francisco fed president mary daly said last week that if we continue to see a cooling labor market and inflation heading back to our target we can hold interest rates steady and let the effects of policy continue to work meanwhile fed governor michelle bowman said recently that she continues to expect that further rate increases will likely be needed to return inflation to in a timely way
to put it simply fed officials are divided because the economy s future is riddled with many uncertainties
it s just not clear whether inflation will slow further as employers continue to hire at a solid clip or whether the bond market s sell off will constrain the economy just enough to pull inflation down
also how much the resumption of student loan repayments this month will ultimately weigh on spending is unknown given the biden administration has recently approved some debt relief
so fed officials are divided but it doesn t really matter
divergent opinions at the fed is simply a feature of the central bank during pivotal junctures such as right now
it generally should be seen as a good thing that they have different opinions
that s arguably a design feature of the committee that there are varying views that get aired otherwise there s a risk of group think wrote michael feroli chief us economist at jpmorgan in a statement to cnn
fed officials are still people and as the saying goes opinions are like bellybuttons in that everyone s got one
the federal open market committee the fed committee that sets monetary policy has reached unanimous policy decisions nearly every meeting this entire rate hiking cycle that began in march
it s also not that surprising that the decisions have been unanimous
the fed started from so far behind the curve that catching up was an obvious decision
now that we are getting closer to the end is when we see more differences open up feroli said
fed officials in that committee with voting power have the option to dissent but it s only happened twice this cycle
the last dissent was from former kansas city fed president esther george more than a year ago
that s when a division could matter if multiple officials dissent
but that s extremely unlikely even right now
a dissent just means someone is violently opposed to the decision that the group is making
you have to have a very high degree of conviction to do that ed al hussainy columbia threadneedle investments senior interest rates and currency analyst told cnn
both sides have very valid arguments and one camp is trying to convince people in the other camp he said
al hussainy added that even if one official dissents it won t mean much jpmorgan s feroli said that historically more than one dissent was a signal of a heavily divided committee
i think that s probably still the case and i would be surprised if we saw more than one dissent in the near future feroli added
it s also worth noting that voting members at the fomc change at the start of each year
in total there are voting members on the fomc
seven of those votes will always come from the members of the board of governors at the fed which includes fed chair jerome powell
the president of the new york fed currently john williams always votes at meetings
the remaining votes come from four of the other regional fed banks
this year s voters which are dallas fed president lorie logan chicago fed president austan goolsbee philadelphia fed president patrick harker and minneapolis fed president neel kashkari will be rotated out next year
logan and kashkari are considered hawks or ones who back a tougher stance on fighting inflation and the other two are doves or ones who fret causing unnecessary economic damage through additional fed tightening
next year s voters are the presidents of the fed banks in cleveland richmond atlanta and san francisco
the atlanta fed s raphael bostic and the san francisco fed s daly would be the two most dovish fed presidents with voting power in
cnn s elisabeth buchwald contributed to this report
the federal reserve may be in a quandry over interest rates but it seems to have enough of an argument to continue to hold them steady
us hiring accelerated last month with employers adding a robust jobs
that s at odds with fed officials goal of cooling the job market to bring inflation to the central bank s target and should mean that one last rate hike is coming at the fed s two day policy meeting coming up in just a few weeks
however the recent sell off in government bonds means that the us financial system will become more burdensome for american families and businesses which could itself cool the economy
the yield on the year us treasury bond rose above this week for the first time since on the expectation that the fed will keep rates higher for longer
friday s blockbuster jobs report pushed yields even higher
us treasuries are the benchmark used to price debt so higher yields mean higher rates on everything from car loans to the cost of mergers and acquisitions
raising rates even further could put americans in an even tougher financial spot
so the fed has a tough decision to make the bond market rout could cool the economy enough for the fed to hold rates steady
or the fed could view the job market s resilience as a threat to inflation s defeat requiring another rate hike
but there is also a strong case for a pause and a majority of investors agrees
by friday afternoon markets saw a roughly chance that the fed will decide to hold rate steady again at its october november meeting according to the cme fedwatch tool
here s the case for another pause higher treasury yields and tougher bank lending standards will continue to constrain the economy taking more steam out of inflation but rates might stay higher for long due to the resilience of some underlying inflationary pressures particularly in the services sector
