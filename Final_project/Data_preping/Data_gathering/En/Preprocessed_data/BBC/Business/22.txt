This month marks the first time in more than three years that federal student loan borrowers will be required to make monthly repayments
The Trump and Biden administrations enacted and then expanded a pandemic related pause for about million borrowers by freezing their accounts and restricting interest accumulation But Congress ruled as part of the debt ceiling package that it passed in June that the relief program can no longer be extended Payments resumed on October for the first time since March
Before the pandemic the federal government was collecting about billion in payments each month A recent report from the Wall Street Journal estimated that the restart could pull more than billion from consumers’ wallets this year alone
Before the Bell spoke with Betsy Mayotte president and founder of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors to talk about what that could mean for the economy
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity
Before the Bell When exactly do student loan payments resume
Betsy Mayotte Not everybody has the same due date of the month Some people have to pay their loans back on the first of the month and some people have to pay on the th So whenever your actual due date is it will be when your first payment is due in October Some people have already had payments due
So how many Americans will have to resume these monthly payments by the end of October
The last time I checked there were more than million federal student loan borrowers A small percentage of those weren’t eligible for the Covid waiver But for everybody else unless they’re currently in school here we go All good things must come to an end
What kind of impact does this have on the health of the American consumer
People are watching this for sure If someone’s monthly payment was affordable before Covid it might not be anymore Things are more expensive than they were Housing cars even lettuce all cost more than they did the last time payments were due
On the flip side the White House introduced a new payment plan called SAVE which stands to reduce a lot of borrowers’ payments That could wash out the difference in the cost of goods versus being able to get a lower monthly payment But I have heard from borrowers that say ‘well there goes my Netflix subscription’ or ‘there goes my weekly movie date’ It’s definitely going to impact some consumer spending But it’s going to be a long time until we actually see what the impact is
What else have you heard about the potential economic impact of loans resuming
The primary sentiment I’m hearing is that people feel overwhelmed and anxious About of the questions we’ve been getting from student loan borrowers over the last couple of months are about figuring out which payment plan works best With federal student loans we almost have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to the sheer number of different repayment plans there are Borrowers feel overwhelmed trying to make sure they pick the right one This is money we’re talking about and it’s a debt that could potentially have a long term effect on their finances It’s just ‘My God what plan do I pick’
I’m also hearing from people who have done the math and use the tools that are out there and looked at what their payment options are and still find that it’s not affordable for them especially people that live in high cost of living areas like California New York and Massachusetts I hear a lot from them saying that they still can’t afford the lowest payment because their rent is too high or because they also have private student loans which don’t have lower payment options
They can’t afford the loans and don’t know what to do
The cost of college has risen dramatically and can now be a year Does something have to change or will debt levels keep rising
You hit the nail on the head I’ve been in this industry for over years and this administration has arguably done more for these especially vulnerable borrowers than any other has done but it doesn’t fix the problem Because the problem is the cost of higher education What makes me a little nuts is that with all this discussion about whether there should be student loan forgiveness or whether this new lower payment option is too generous and not fair to the US taxpayer there hasn’t been any discussion about the cost of education
That’s the policy discussion that has to be had in order to permanently fix the student debt crisis And I’ll take that a step further If we could get the states to reinvest in higher education that would lower the price of state schools which are what economists might consider the anchor price schools If you can bring the price of the state schools down the other schools are going to have to follow just from a competition standpoint
If a private nonprofit university costs a year and a state school is a year it becomes harder for a private university’s tuition to pass the laugh test But if a state school is above that private tuition doesn’t seem so outrageous
Here’s one other thing that’s going to get me taken off of the Christmas card list I think it’s time for schools to have some skin in the game When it comes to student debt if they’re producing degrees that don’t have the return on investment to pay back the debt that the students have to take on the burden shouldn’t fall on US taxpayers and on the borrowers The schools should have to pay as well

Pharmacists technicians and support staff are planning walkouts from Monday through Wednesday an organizer who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution confirmed to CNN Employees at more than of America’s approximately Walgreens stores across the United States have expressed interest and solidarity the organizer said

In a statement to CNN Walgreens acknowledged that pharmacy employees were overworked
The last few years have required an unprecedented effort from our team members and we share their pride in this work — while recognizing it has been a very challenging time said Fraser Engerman a communications director at Walgreens We also understand the immense pressures felt across the US in retail pharmacy right now We are engaged and listening to the concerns raised by some of our team members
