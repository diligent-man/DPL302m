Kenneth Branagh has found a nice rhythm in his Hercule Poirot mysteries serving as director producer and star A Haunting in Venice his third go round with writer Michael Green derives its main wrinkle from the vaguely supernatural tone a just in time for Halloween adornment that might add a small commercial boost to a formula otherwise as neatly manicured as the great detective’s moustache

Branagh might go a little overboard on those flourishes but he again creates a nice showcase for his international cast among them Jude Hill the young star of the director’s deeply personal Belfastas the precocious son of the doctor Jamie Dornan again playing Hill’s dad responsible for treating the late girl
While there’s a decidedly old fashioned quality to these movies Branagh has managed to both retrofit Christie the actual novel is titled Hallowe’en Party for the st century capitalize on the international locales and make the Poirot character with his abundant and amusing tics and quirks his own
Whether that means his version of Poirot will be back again A Haunting in Venice continues a brand of breezy entertainment that suggests whatever the detective’s goals retirement doesn’t appear to be in the cards
