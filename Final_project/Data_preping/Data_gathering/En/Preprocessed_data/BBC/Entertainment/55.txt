given the rarity of big bold sci fi concepts without a after the title it s a bit of shame to return a tepid verdict on the creator director co writer gareth edwards attempt to build a stirring drama around a war ravaged future pitting humankind against artificial intelligence
while the film traffics in thoughtful ideas as well as spectacle it doesn t complete the vital emotional connections between its head and its heart
humanizing ai hardly represents a new concept and the leap forward with most of the movie unfolding not quite years from now operates on roughly the same speculative road blade runner traveled more effectively in also contemplating fundamental questions about what could make a machine essentially human
the sly and manipulative trick here involves dressing up that artificial person in the form of an adorable child nicknamed alfie newcomer madeleine yuna voyles who carries the unfortunate weight of the world and the potential key to the aforementioned war on its slim and tiny shoulders
as a bonus the human who stumbles into the task of protecting that mysterious child former special forces agent joshua john david washington is nursing an almost unimaginable wound having lost his pregnant wife gemma chan to the prosecution of the war left sleepwalking through life when he s grudgingly recruited back to the fight
the origins of the conflict get rapidly explained at the outset a devastating event in los angeles described as an attack by ai upon humanity
the west has responded by banning ai whereas the people of new asia still embrace it leading to war as the west seeks to eradicate the threat beyond its shores
still the west s sky borne weapon of mass destruction called nomad could be endangered by an answer developed in new asia one capable of neutralizing the technology
that prospect turns the ai child into a prize sought by both sides and leaves joshua caught between his growing bond with the kid and the military commander allison janney underemployed here who enlisted him
having directed rogue one a star wars story edwards who shares script credit with chris weitz brings considerable visual flair and massive imax worthy scale to the action sequences and general design creating a credibly futuristic world where the ai characters or at least some of them are identifiable by the whirring holes in the side of their heads
all that serves as an elaborate backdrop though to joshua processing his grief and his perilous travels with alfie which face a dizzying barrage of impediments as they build toward the seemingly inevitably test of the child s destiny
that relationship like our understanding of the ai community must also unfold on the fly which can make the creator a tad impenetrable at times particularly in the early going
ultimately the movie boils down to buying into the feeling that develops between man and machine always a tough bond to sell and one that as constructed doesn t entirely pay off here even with the cherubic face of its tiny co star
again credit edwards with attempting to tackle what at its core represents a character driven story wrapped in a big sci fi bow one that happily doesn t feel like it s trying to create some new franchise to spawn sequels and sell plush toys
on that level the creator feels intelligent artificial or otherwise
it s just not enough to make the movie fully spring to life in the way its creator intended
