the morning show has the look and polish of a smart prestige tv show which makes its detours into stupid situations and implausible corners more frustrating
the third season of the apple tv drama again weaves real world events into its narrative but this starrily cast serial would fare better if it stuck to soap opera style fantasy instead of positioning itself as a succession wannabe
like that hbo series and showtime s billions mercurial billionaires factor prominently into the latest plot that drives the story this season
here billionaire fever arrives in the form of paul marks played by jon hamm who between this and good omens has a near full streaming plate a rocket flying mogul who network honcho cory ellison billy crudup excellent as always is desperately trying to woo as a buyer for uba leveraging his high powered anchors alex levy jennifer aniston and bradley jackson reese witherspoon to advance that campaign
the jockeying around the acquisition deal turns out to be the most fertile and satisfying plot in a season that plunges into the high stakes world of big business including the fallout from an email hack that risks exposing all sorts of embarrassing company secrets
that plot echoes what happened at sony in and provides a credible fictional version of what transpires behind the scenes during a public relations nightmare
if only the series could maintain those kinds of highlights
instead the writing consistently takes misguided turns into various controversial story lines including the jan
insurrection with bradley getting caught up in those events flashing back to the early days of covid and plunging into the supreme court s decision overturning roe v
while those events should provide ripe fodder for dramatic storytelling the series keeps handling them in over the top ways
on abortion for example it strains credulity for one of the anchors to be na ve enough to publicly post inflammatory political material about the supreme court and then act surprised when that becomes an issue
the network also continues to produce plenty of awkward at work relationships with big personalities and even bigger feelings including bradley s romance with laura peterson julianna margulies and a new and potentially complicated entanglement for alex
in a way the morning show served its purpose out of the starting gate simply by attracting aniston and witherspoon who double as producers demonstrating that apple s then fledgling streaming service could play in the big leagues in terms of a list talent
the result though has been a handsome series with a beyond good cast that doesn t consistently rise to that level with its inside view of tv news and the corporations that oversee it
while that milieu produced memorable movies of yore like network and broadcast news it s been challenging for series with aaron sorkin s the newsroom exhibiting savvy about the mechanics of news while getting bogged down by its relationships before succession knocked it out of the park
we can t fight every battle alex says at one point which is ironic since the show derives some of its appeal from simultaneously fighting battles on so many different fronts
the issue isn t about the fights the morning show chooses
but to join top tier dramas as opposed to just a breezy diversion it needs to be smarter about fighting the battles that it does
the morning show begins its third season september on apple tv
