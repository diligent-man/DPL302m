When it comes to horror there s really no substitute for atmosphere and the murky doorways and long dark hallways that come with old European buildings in the s Enter The Nun II a slick if familiar addition to the very fertile Conjuring universe that by deftly expanding on the hit appears destined to become another cinematic habit
Set four years after the events of the original that introduced demon fighting nun Sister Irene Taissa Farmiga and the handy Maurice Jonas Bloquet much of the action takes place around a French boarding school where the demon nun Valak Bonnie Aarons reprises her glowering role has resurfaced
The grisly pre opening title death of a priest alerts the Vatican that the evil Sister Irene had thwarted has arisen again evil tends to do that when box office success demands it and she reluctantly agrees to the assignment She s unexpectedly joined by a headstrong young nun played by Euphoria and Missing s Storm Reid who turns out to be a plucky if somewhat underemployed sidekick
Directed by Michael Chaves a veteran of these films with The Conjuring The Devil Made Me Do It and The Curse of La Llorona from a screenplay credited to a trio of writers The Nun II doesn t trifle with the formula which relies heavily on jump out at you scares vivid nightmares and spooky spectral visions
Although the story goes through some late contortions to present Irene a plausible means of fighting back these movies generally don t hold together particularly well down the home stretch when the mayhem begins in earnest Then again by that point they don t really need to having already delivered the requisite thrills
Aside from providing steady employment for the Farmiga sisters with Vera a mainstay of The Conjuring series these movies illustrate both horror s enduring power relative to other theatrical genres and how expanding the palette in terms of geography and chronology can add a sprinkle of freshness to basic haunted house constructions with a story that easily might have featured Vincent Price in decades past
While the credits contain a small bonus scene The Nun II needn t remind us that its work might not be done Because even if the film s finish closes this chapter it s hardly a reach to assume that when dealing with a cog in a money making machine this isn t so much goodbye as merely good night Irene
The Nun II premieres September in US theaters It s rated R
