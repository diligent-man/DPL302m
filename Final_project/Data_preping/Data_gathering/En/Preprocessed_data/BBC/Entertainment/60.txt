enter the nun ii a slick if familiar addition to the very fertile conjuring universe that by deftly expanding on the hit appears destined to become another cinematic habit
set four years after the events of the original that introduced demon fighting nun sister irene taissa farmiga and the handy maurice jonas bloquet much of the action takes place around a french boarding school where the demon nun valak bonnie aarons reprises her glowering role has resurfaced

she s unexpectedly joined by a headstrong young nun played by euphoria and missing s storm reid who turns out to be a plucky if somewhat underemployed sidekick
directed by michael chaves a veteran of these films with the conjuring the devil made me do it and the curse of la llorona from a screenplay credited to a trio of writers the nun ii doesn t trifle with the formula which relies heavily on jump out at you scares vivid nightmares and spooky spectral visions

because even if the film s finish closes this chapter it s hardly a reach to assume that when dealing with a cog in a money making machine this isn t so much goodbye as merely good night irene
