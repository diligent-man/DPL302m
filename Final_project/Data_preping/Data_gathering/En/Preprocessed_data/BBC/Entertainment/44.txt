for several years a mysterious spherical structure has been rising on the skyline of this desert playground teasing visitors in recent months with its wraparound led screen transforming the giant orb into a planet a basketball or most distractingly a blinking eyeball
now finally we get to go inside
sphere the billion venture being billed as the entertainment venue of the future made its public debut this weekend with two concerts by u
does sphere live up to the hype are the interior visuals as eye popping as the ones outside is u the beloved irish band now in the latter stage of their career the right act to christen this arena the size of a small planet
yes yes and yes with a few caveats
describing the sphere concert experience is a challenge because there s nothing quite like it
the effect is a little like being in a giant planetarium a juiced up imax theater or maybe vr without the headset
built by madison square garden entertainment sphere is being billed as the world s largest spherical structure
at feet tall and feet wide the partially hollow arena could fit the entire statue of liberty base to torch comfortably inside
its cavernous bowl shaped theater contains a stage at the bottom level flanked by what is reportedly the world s largest and highest resolution led screen
the screen wraps up and around the audience members and depending on the location of your seat it can fill your entire field of vision
in today s multimedia entertainment world overused buzzwords like immersive get thrown around a lot
but sphere s vast screen and pristine sound truly earn that label
i interviewed a handful of audience members after the show and they all raved about the venue
it s an overwhelming experience visually it was mind boggling said dave zittig who traveled with his wife tracy from salt lake city for saturday night s show
and they picked the right band to open it with
we ve been to concerts around the world and this is the coolest venue we ve been to
the venue s inaugural offering is called u uv achtung baby live at sphere a series of concerts built around the irish band s landmark album achtung baby and running through mid december
most of the shows are sold out despite prices of for the best seats
the show launched friday night with an avalanche of buzz and a red carpet premiere attended by paul mccartney oprah snoop dogg jeff bezos and dozens of other celebrities some of them probably wondering how they can book their own sphere gigs
friday brings the premiere of postcard from earth a film by darren aronofsky that promises to take full advantage of sphere s enormous screen by offering viewers a yes immersive tour of the planet
and more concerts will be coming in although no artists have been announced
someone is probably already courting taylor swift
visitors can walk through alleys and across parking lots to reach sphere just east of the strip although the easiest way is through a pedestrian walkway from the venetian resort a partner in the venture
once inside you ll encounter a high ceilinged atrium with hanging sculptural mobiles and long escalators leading to the upper levels
but the real draw is the theater and its wraparound led canvas which boasts million video pixels
that sounds like a lot
the screen is impressive and so dominant that it sometimes overwhelms the live performers
at times i didn t know where to look at the band playing live before me or at the dazzling visuals going on everywhere else
your idea of the ideal seat will depend on how much you want to see the artist up close
the and levels are at eye level with the center of the massive screen while seats in the lowest level will be closer to the stage but may have you craning your neck to look up
and be warned some seats in the rear of the lowest section have obstructed views
the venerable band bono the edge adam clayton and guest drummer bram van den berg filling in for larry mullen jr who is recovering from surgery sounded as passionate as ever moving nimbly from propulsive rockers even better than the real thing to tender ballads one and beyond
u retains a huge loyal following writes grandiose songs and has long pushed the boundaries of technology notably on their zoo tv tour making them a natural fit for a pioneering venue like sphere
the band performed on a simple stage built like a turntable with the four musicians mostly rooted in the circular platter although bono roamed around the fringes
almost every song came with animations and live footage on the enormous screen
bono seemed to embrace the sphere s trippy visuals saying this whole place feels like a distortion pedal for the mind
the wraparound screen conjured both scale and intimacy as when bono the edge and other band members appeared in foot high video images projected above the stage
sphere s producers promised state of the art sound thanks to thousands of speakers embedded throughout the venue and it did not disappoint
at some concerts the sound is so muddy you can t decipher the performers stage patter but bono s words were crisp and clear and the band s volume never felt strenuous or weak
i go to a lot of concerts and i usually wear earplugs but i didn t need them for this one said rob rich who flew in from chicago with a buddy for the show
it was so immersive he added there s that word again
i ve seen u eight times
and this is the standard now
midway through the show the band departed from achtung baby to do an acoustic set of songs from rattle and hum the visuals became simpler and the stripped down songs yielded some of the night s best moments a reminder that while bells and whistles are nice great live music is enough on its own
saturday s show was only sphere s second public event and they are still working out some bugs
the band started about a half an hour late bono blamed technical issues and at one point the led screen seemed to malfunction freezing on one image for a few minutes over multiple songs
but more often the visuals were spectacular
at one point during the fly the screen created a dramatic optical illusion that the venue s ceiling was descending towards the audience
for tryin to throw your arms around the world a real life rope was lowered from the ceiling and connected to a virtual balloon high overhead
and where the streets have no name brought a sweeping time lapse video of the nevada desert complete with the sun migrating across the sky overhead
for a few minutes it felt like we were outside
the curmudgeon in me has some skepticism about sphere
tickets are not cheap
its mammoth interior screen threatened to swallow up the band who looked pretty tiny from the venue s upper levels
and the audience s energy at times seemed strangely muted as if people were too enraptured by the visuals to actually cheer the performers
but the kid in me was totally enthralled
sphere is an expensive gamble and it remains to be seen whether other artists can make such creative use of its unique space
but the venue is off to a promising start
if they can keep it up we may be witnessing the future of live performance
