loki didn t deliver unqualified magic but the disney series was weird and inventive enough to cast a spell over fans while introducing controversial actor jonathan majors mysterious villain into the marvel universe
returning after majors theatrical debut in the less than scintillating ant man sequel the second season of loki feels more assured and focused if still decidedly out there all while toting around its fair share of baggage
it was a bit of a jolt when loki concluded on a cliffhanger in leaving the story of loki tom hiddleston and his new posse at the time variance authority unfinished
while trying to explain what s at stake requires a whole lot of time suffice it to say the complications associated with alternate branches of reality continue leaving loki and mobius owen wilson frantically seeking to avoid a temporal meltdown that would be very very bad
as they endeavor to save the tva the pair acquire some new allies in this second season perhaps foremost among them ke huy quan fresh off his oscar for everything everywhere all at once as an eccentric mr
fix it type
there s also the matter of finding sylvie sophia di martino the revenge minded variant who might hold the key to staving off the feared implosion
as for the baggage the aforementioned majors does return in a role related to his kang persona which has been earmarked as the antagonistic linchpin of marvel s next phase of movies
unfortunately ant man and the wasp quantumania got that arc off to a rather unsatisfying start and off camera issues surrounding the actor who faces misdemeanor assault charges in a case still working its way through the courts have clouded his future involvement
broadly speaking loki derives a great deal of its pleasure from things that have little to do with advancing the larger plot beginning with watching hiddleston and wilson playfully banter as if this were a time traveling buddy cop show
there s also an intriguing internal battle going on between hiddleston s suave charisma which explains the off the charts fan response and the character s notorious god of mischief nature which originally saw him battling thor and then the avengers
if nothing else give marvel credit for extracting this much mileage from a character who wound up on the very wrong end of a fight with thanos way back in
that said the multiverse concept and associated emphasis on alternative timelines occasionally rendering death a mere inconvenience can have a slightly numbing effect by fostering the impression that what happens doesn t seem as if it truly matters while running the risk of demanding graduate level classes just to keep track of the endless possibilities
loki tacitly acknowledges as much in one of the later episodes previewed as the title character tells someone i promise you this will make sense
based on what s gone before it there s not a whole lot of certainly the second season of loki will deliver on that pledge
thankfully its namesake provides the kind of good company that makes it fun just getting there even when it feels as if it s getting nowhere
