when considering the simple pleasures of the john wick movies character development and dense back story would rate somewhere below the bottom of the list
the world of streaming however favors the long winded a factor much in evidence in the continental from the world of john wick a handsomely produced but unnecessary prequel peacock miniseries with a keanu reeves shaped donut hole
set in the s the three part project the time commitment that suggests is a bit misleading since each chapter running well over an hour derives its biggest kick from the very savvily selected period song score nicely setting the mood of a gritty shadowy new york during the disco years
frankly those songs like donna summer s i feel love do as much as the wick style fight sequences to make the continental worth a visit if not a full stay
the highest hurdle likely involves the plot which focuses on the history of the hotel haven for assassins the mysterious organization known as the high table and hotel proprietor winston scott ian mcshane in the movies played here by colin woodell
this younger version of winston is essentially minding his own business trying to make it as an entrepreneur when his battle hardened brother frankie ben robson steals something from the high table prompting an extended densely choreographed fight of the punch shoot twice variety
desperate to find frankie the high table and the continental s owner cormac played by mel gibson abducts him
gibson gives the show its one bit of identifiable star power with the tradeoff being his strangely accented over the top performance is distractingly bad
facing such formidable adversaries winston needs allies
he gradually finds them but all the story driven shenanigans involved in assembling them feel a little too much like killing time before getting to the next action sequence which let s face it is the main attraction
indeed there s not much sense the wider wick world holds that much fascination and while the show does produce some intriguing characters perhaps the best being yen nhung kate whose first impulse in almost every dangerous situation is to punch her way out of it john wick s supporting players including the recognizable names such as charon the late lance reddick in the four movies and ayomide adegun here don t amass enough screen time to stoke much demand for an origin story
a fight with a contortionist does add a novel twist to things literally and the decision to deploy the hotel s weirdos to pursue winston along with an homage to the matrix offers a sense of the show s playful almost eccentric edge
premium tv standards also apply to the language violence and sex the last a pastime for which the movies understandably haven t had much time
yet despite no shortage of action the continental finally feels short on firepower
granted for a streaming service like peacock which will spread the show over three successive weeks just the chance to draft off the john wick name is surely a no brainer even if this period piece is a relatively big ticket item
after checking out the accommodations though whatever curiosity and novelty that might the continental have held soon fades making the prospect of booking future reservations one that peacock for the time being should likely put on hold
the continental from the world of john wick premieres september on peacock
