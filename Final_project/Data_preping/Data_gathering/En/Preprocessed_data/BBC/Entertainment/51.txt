Country music has been going through a reckoning of late and Maren Morris is here to say she’s done with sides of the genre that she finds toxic
The Texas born singer released a duo of new songs and music videos on Friday titled The Tree and Get The Hell Out Of Here under an EP called The Bridge
The songs offer a look into Morris’s feelings on the state of country music today as she sings in The Tree about how she’s taking an axe to the tree The rot at the roots is the root of the problem But you wanna blame it on me I hung around longer than anyone should
The music videos for the two songs share a narrative thread and both take place in a fake and stale looking community of dollhouse sized homes and businesses making up a small town that goes through various states of destruction
There is even a sign identifying the location as a perfect small town from sunrise to sundown seemingly a reference to Jason Aldean’s polarizing song Try That in a Small Town and Morris’s earlier public dispute with him as well as other placards including one that says Go Woke Go Broke
In Get The Hell Out Of Here Morris sings I do the best I can But the more I hang around here The less I give a damn which seems to hint that she is planning an exodus of sorts from the genre of country as a whole
Other telling lyrics in The Tree show how Morris is done screaming the truth to a liar Spent ten thousand hours trying to fight it with Flowers When the tree was already on fire
In an interview published on Friday Morris told the LA Times of country music I thought I’d like to burn it to the ground and start over But it’s burning itself down without my help
As for what’s next for the Grammy winner it just might be something more pop infused if her collaborator on Get The Hell Out Of Here is any indication She recorded that track with producer Jack Antonoff known for creating pop magic with Taylor Swift Morris and Antonoff are currently working on a new LP according to the publication
