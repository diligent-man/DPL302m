after three superbly savage seasons the boys has graduated to the spinoffs stage first with the animated shorts diabolical and now gen v a supes in college series that s every bit as nasty in mostly good ways as the flagship series
cleverly drafting off the anchor show this coming of age superhero satire in some ways feels like what the new mutants should have been
as usual with the boys the premiere roars out of the starting gate offering a horrific demonstration of the dangers of uncontrolled powers and puberty
that toxic combination informs the back story of marie moreau jaz sinclair whose strange ability involves wielding her own blood as a weapon becoming the latest student at superhero training ground godolkin university or god u
for short
understandably reserved marie quickly falls in with the cool kids on campus a group led by the appropriately named golden boy patrick schwarzenegger who appears to be on the fast track to not only graduate at the top of his class but earn coveted entry into the super group known as the seven whose real unsavory natures are well known to viewers of the boys
still all is not as it seems at godolkin unleashing a shocking series of events and underlying mystery as what or who was responsible
that thrusts marie into sort of detective mode without being entirely sure who she can trust other than her roommate emma lizze broadway whose ability to shrink ant man style is both played for broad laughs and a source of rather pointed social commentary
indeed if there s one underlying thread to the wider the boys universe beyond the corrupting aspects of power it s the commoditization of superpowers where everything is seen as a means of feeding the financial interests of vought the corporation that transforms babies into superheroes and just as often monsters
at the college that leaves all sorts of ways to potentially cash in on one s powers whether it s crimefighting or entertainment with the bosses at vought acting as if there s scant difference between the two
saving the world or starring in reality tv hey it s all showbiz kids
setting this all around a college dorm is as deliciously fraught with possibilities as that sounds although gen v occasionally bogs down a bit on its riverdale with superpowers soap opera elements
fortunately over the six episodes previewed the first season will run eight there s enough momentum with shifting alliances and relationships to pull viewers along
plus the producers know their audience well enough to pepper the dialogue with clever pop culture riffs indulging in detours like debating the merits of waterworld
the boys world surely isn t intended for the faint of heart but there s method to its madness and an underlying warning about greed run amok and parents letting their babies be turned into medical experiments their values warped by the promise of riches at the end of that rainbow
of all the big ticket franchises launched by newer streaming services including amazon s massive bet on the bland the lord of the rings the rings of power the boys has to be among the most valuable and gen v only provides further evidence of its fertile commercial potential
like the adults in this ruthless environment the kids might be extraordinary but they re not all right
that formula might not quite equal the boys at its best but for those who sink their teeth into it gen v passes its admission test with flying colors
gen v premieres september on amazon s prime video
