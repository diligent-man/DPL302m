just after releasing a new album drake announced he plans to step away from the spotlight for an extended period of time to focus on his health
the artist was a guest on the table for one on siriusxm s sound friday morning where he said i probably won t make music for a little bit
i need to focus on my health first and foremost
nothing crazy but just like you know i want people to be healthy in life drake explained
he added that the issues were related to his stomach
i need to focus on my health and i need to get right and i m going to do that drake said
so i m a lock the door in the studio for a little bit
i don t even know what a little bit is maybe a year
the rapper also released the video for his new song am in charlotte off his new album for all the dogs his year old son adonis opens the video by explaining a piece of artwork he drew
all right
adonis tell me about your beautiful piece of artwork that you sold me drake tells him at the start of the video
adonis explains so it s the same story
so the goat was running away from the other monsters
and the other animals
and a flower blocking the way
so the flowers of fire
the racing car was maybe helping the goat
and there was this some stairs who s like a jail stairs
and there was one person who was on top
and he got killed by the stick by the track
ok so it s almost like a little story drake asks
yes adonis replies
drake asks about the letters on the drawing saying and what is sbw so it s not a word but i just wanted to write sbw adonis says
you like those letters and daddy s name is next to the goat
does that mean that daddy s the goat drake asks
so it s daddy goat adonis says
daddy goat
that makes perfect sense to me
and do you want to talk about how much how much money you got for your beautiful drawing drake asks
oh please adonis says
