five decades after oscar winning actor ellen burstyn lived a mother s nightmare in the exorcist she has reprised her role as chris macneil in the exorcist believer
now burstyn says shes busier than ever
her memorable career credits range from starring roles like her sitcom in the s with megan mullally playing her daughter to scene stealing supporting turns in dozens of titles including that now infamous second role in s tv movie mrs
harris which nonetheless earned her an emmy nod
here s a look at just a few of burstyn s indelible performances in film and television
already a seasoned theater and television actor who had only a handful of film credits to her name burstyn s portrayal of a bored and bitter housewife and mother in peter bogdanovich s searing drama about smalltown texas life cemented her status as a stellar presence on the big screen and scored her her first nomination for an academy award for best supporting actress
as unprecedented now as it was then this william friedkin directed classic became the most acclaimed horror film of all time a title it arguably still holds
a large part of that of course comes from the performances
in burstyn talked about the way she prepared for her role of a mother to a demonically possessed girl saying how she was careful to make sure the audience identified with the character
you always want the audience to feel what you re feeling she reflected
that authenticity makes what happens later in the movie all the more compelling and horrifying
unsurprisingly the film earned her a second oscar nod her first for best lead actress
in her oscar winning role in martin scorsese s drama burstyn exhibits a matter of factness and realism as a single mother just trying to make ends meet while also realize her dream to be a singer
as she and her son travel from place to place in search of a home bustyn s ability to vacillate from playfulness to dogged determination to sheer terror when a beau harvey keitel explodes in a rage at her is a showcase for her talents
this sex farce opposite alan alda was somewhat of a departure for burstyn
the movie follows a pair married to other people who meet once a year for a passionate and ongoing affair and showed a more demure and even flirty side to the performer
it also earned her a fourth oscar nomination
as terrifying as the exorcist was nothing could prepare moviegoers for the horrors of darren aronofsky s twisted requiem which showed the agony and destruction caused by drug and substance abuse
burstyn s performance as a pill addled woman with a fast failing grip on reality remains almost absurd in how extreme it becomes matching only the insanity happening all around her in this mindbending and tragic opus
this miniseries saw burstyn as the martini swilling trash mouthed mother to a former first lady and current secretary of state sigourney weaver mired in scandal
the formidable pair s repartee is thoroughly enjoyable to watch and the role serves as a wonderful example of burstyn s prolific work on television earning her one of two primetime emmys
an odd and poignant movie starring blake lively as a seemingly immortal woman who watches everyone age around her the age of adaline packs some surprisingly touching moments when lively s titular character sees her daughter slowly turn into an older woman played by burstyn
the duo maintain an authentic mother daughter connection that remains one of the highlights of the film
