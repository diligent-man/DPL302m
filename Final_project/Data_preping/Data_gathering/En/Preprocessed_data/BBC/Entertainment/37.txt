a half century after the original helped rewrite the rules of horror and launched a thousand imitators the exorcist believer tries picking up that mantle with the lure of year old ellen burstyn reprising her role
the nostalgia factor elevates an otherwise slow building film that maintains an eerie creepiness before fumbling through a slightly muddled climactic act
it s hard to overstate how shocking the original the exorcist was in based on william peter blatty s novel about demonic possession changing among other things how a lot of people look at pea soup
a trio of widely spaced sequels one prequel endless cable specials and countless knockoffs have followed further evidence that when a title is this iconic it s hard to keep a good demon down
that seems to be the plan with believer which hails from horror factory blumhouse and director david gordon green who oversaw the recent halloween trilogy
yet franchising this property presents a formidable challenge since the exorcist derived its fear factor from an understated dread every time someone approached the stairs to the possessed girl s room unlike the jump at you scares and ostentatious gore that have become the status quo in the intervening decades
believer essentially tries to wed those two slightly disparate impules which leaves the film in a sort of in between land in terms of expectations of modern horror and honoring its roots
the same goes for burstyn s extended cameo as the frantic dad victor leslie odom jr grudgingly reaches out to her chris macneil who it turns out wrote a book detailing her ordeal
victor is raising year old angela lydia jewett alone having lost her mother when the girl was born
the two seem happy enough which doesn t prevent angela from venturing into the woods with her friend katherine olivia o neill engaging in a ritual that might help her contact her late mom
the girls disappear for a time and everyone s relieved when they turn up at least before their behavior becomes increasingly odd then disturbing
the film s at its best during that stretch as katherine s parents jennifer nettles and norbert leo butz turn to their church for guidance while victor fields unsolicited advice from his concerned neighbor the handmaid tale s ann dowd
jewett and o neill also do yeoman work in flashing glimpses of evil making them even scarier than the average teenager
frankly if the movie stayed within that key it would be more effective even if that meant sacrificing hard core horror fans
the finishing kick though tries to segue into more conventional horror and gets lost in the pyrotechnics providing a stark demonstration of the adage less is more
between the burstyn boost small touches like incorporating the spine tingling original music tubular bells and the uneasy first half the exorcist believer still proves a moderately worthy heir though the intention to develop this into another trilogy a la halloween leaves ample skepticism about whether there s enough meat on the bone to slice away at it any further
the most comforting aspect of the exorcist after all was the prospect in the quiet wake of all that pain and sacrifice of an amnesiac regan and her mom getting on with their lives
while believer ultimately hangs on the notion of faith the only thing worse than having too little of it potentially is having too much of it
