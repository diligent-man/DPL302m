She was the best Anderson said of Vogel Since then I just felt without Alexis it’s just better for me not to wear makeup
The toned down look Anderson said is freeing and fun and a little rebellious too
Because I did notice that there were all these people doing big makeup looks and it’s just like me to go against the grain and do the opposite what everyone’s doing she said I think we all start looking a little funny when we get older And I’m kind of laughing at myself when I look at the mirror I go ‘Wow this is really…what’s happening to me’ It’s a journey
Anderson has been back in the limelight with a new book documentary and several fashion shoots including with Hugo Boss and Tommy Hilfiger
