actress julia ormond is suing disgraced former film producer harvey weinstein for battery and sexual assault she says occurred in according to a copy of the complaint obtained by cnn
ormond is also suing the once weinstein owned miramax as well the walt disney company which purchased miramax in for negligence and hollywood talent agency caa creative artists agency who represented the actress for negligence and breach of fiduciary trust
a majority stake of caa was recently purchased by the art mis investment firm
in the complaint first reported by variety ormond alleges that in december she and weinstein were supposed to have a business dinner to discuss a project
however at the dinner weinstein refused to discuss business matters saying he would only discuss the project back at the apartment miramax had provided for ormond as part of their first look deal with her once at the apartment weinstein stripped naked and forced her to perform oral sex on him
harvey weinstein categorically denies the allegations made against him by julia ormond and he is prepared to vehemently defend himself a representative for weinstein told cnn in a statement
this is yet another example of a complaint filed against mr
weinstein after the passing of decades and he is confident that the evidence will not support ms
ormond s claims
the complaint also alleges that miramax or disney could have properly supervised weinstein and not retained him while knowing that he was a danger to the women he encountered at work
ormond claims in the lawsuit that when she recounted what happened her then agents at caa bryan lourd and kevin huvane who are now co chairmen of the powerful hollywood talent group suggested that if she reported weinstein to the authorities she would not be believed and he would seriously damage her career
still worse not long after weinstein s assault on ormond and her reporting of the assault to them caa lost interest in representing her and her career suffered dramatically
cnn has reached out to representatives for miramax the walt disney company and caa along with lourd and huvane who are not directly named as defendants in the lawsuit for comment
caa takes all allegations of sexual assault and abuse seriously and has compassion for ms
ormond and the experience she described in her complaint a caa spokesperson told deadline wednesday night
however the claims that ms
ormond has levied against the agency are completely without merit
ormond shared a statement with cnn on wednesday
after living for decades with the painful memories of my experiences at the hands of harvey weinstein i am humbled and grateful to all those who have risked speaking out ormond said
their courage and the adult survivors act has provided me a window of opportunity and way to shed light on how powerful people and institutions like my talent agents at caa miramax and disney enabled and provided cover for weinstein to assault me and countless others
