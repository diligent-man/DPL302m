Roy Wood Jr who some believed would succeed Trevor Noah as host of The Daily Show has announced he’s leaving the talk show
The correspondent for The Daily Show first shared the news in an interview with NPR’s television critic Eric Deggans
After eight amazing years on The Daily Show where I’ve been able to pursue my comedic and political curiosities with some of the best writers producers crew and correspondents anyone could hope for I’ve made the decision to move on Wood told CNN in a statement I’m grateful to Trevor Noah Paramount and especially Comedy Central for giving me the runway to also produce three one hour stand up specials for letting me host two award winning podcasts letting me write shoot my own comedy pilot write a film and much much more
I look forward to finding other ways to collaborate with them down the road he added Until then I am excited to nurture new ideas and see what the future holds for me in the shifting sands of late night television scripted comedy and whatever else the comedy gods may have in store for me in and beyond
Noah left his job as host after seven years in December A parade of guest hosts have filled in since his departure
It appears that Wood is leaving the show on good terms
Roy Wood Jr is a comedic genius and beloved teammate a spokesperson for The Daily Show said in a statement to CNN His insights and hilarity helped us make sense of the election the pandemic and countless hours of Fox News We thank him for his time with us and can’t wait to see what he does next
Wood spoke with CNN not long after Noah announced his departure He shared his admiration for Noah and joked that when a replacement host was announced he and the other correspondents would probably be the last to know
I think at the end of the day ‘The Daily Show’ has had three hosts and it’s been good and it’s gonna have a fourth host Wood told CNN at the time It’s gonna be good whoever the hell is in the chair then
Wood served this year as the entertainer at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner
