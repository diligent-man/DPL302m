the unexpected success of squid game gave a green light to bringing more south korean dramas to the us with paramount establishing a partnership with seoul based cj enm to do so
the latest fruit of that relationship bargain isn t as compulsively watchable as squid game but echoes it in one key respect darkly reflecting a society where life is cheap and the class divide can be fatal
in that sense both shows have something in common with other high profile south korean productions among them the oscar winning film parasite in which a family of struggling grifters preyed upon and manipulated a wealthy one
as npr reported when squid game took off this strain of drama had its roots in an economic crisis south korea experienced in the late s that devastated its middle class
if there s a common theme to all of these it s desperation and the lengths to which one will go to survive even if that comes at the expense of others
like squid game which netflix will soon exploit further with a game show inspired by the series bargain takes that question to unsettling extremes with an extra twist of distastefulness for good measure
the story begins in a hotel room where hyung soo jin sun kyu has come to meet joo young jun jong seo delivering a standout performance for an arranged paid sexual encounter
having gone to a remote location hyung soo peppers the young woman with questions about her age and virginity
he s right to be suspicious but it s in the wrong ways since joo young is part of an elaborate ring that lures men to the hotel then drugs them and auctions off their organs
yet before hyung soo can be reduced to eyes kidneys and other vital organs what appears to be a devastating earthquake strikes seriously damaging the facility and throwing everything into chaos as those trapped inside must suddenly forge alliances some quite unexpected and awkward in hopes of getting out
as if that weren t enough and frankly it is since the story gradually begins to fly off the rails after the strong start much of the action unfolds in the form of long continuous tracking shots fueling the sensation of anarchy and confusion
along the way crumbs dribble out about how various characters wound up in this predicament with the disclaimer joo young has already shown herself to be an accomplished liar in terms of taking her at her word
adapted from a short film bargain begins to take too many strange and unnecessary detours but it s still oddly compelling and grimly humorous
at the very least you re unlikely to see much that s like it in ways both good and bad
one of the blessings of streaming has been expanded shelf space for programming produced all over the globe acquired as much for financial reasons it s generally less expensive than homegrown fare as an effort to broaden cultural horizons
yet as squid game demonstrated there s increasingly an audience that won t be scared away by subtitles as they once might have been if the story delivers
bargain isn t perfect but it is interesting and wildly unpredictable while further highlighting the intriguing work coming out of south korea
for those who got caught up in squid game the six episode commitment isn t a bad bargain
