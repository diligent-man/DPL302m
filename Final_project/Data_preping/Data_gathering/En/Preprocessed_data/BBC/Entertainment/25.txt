acclaimed director sofia coppola is giving viewers another peek at her upcoming biopic priscilla which takes the focus off the king of rock n roll and shines a light on his iconic wife priscilla presley
a new trailer released on tuesday shows the beginnings of the union between priscilla beaulieu cailee spaeny and elvis presley jacob elordi a pairing that was mired in controversy due to the pair s age gap something priscilla has addressed herself
elvis is already at the height of his fame in the clip and what follows are snippets showing him courting priscilla with the young girl adrift among a crowd of screaming fans as elvis greets her in uniform
in a voice over priscilla s father asks why my daughter when the legendary crooner could have his pick of anyone
well sir i happen to be very fond of your daughter elordi s elvis replies
as the pair grow closer priscilla s unassuming style changes to something more attention getting with bigger and bigger hair until elvis suggests in one scene for her to sport black hair and more eye makeup
i don t know if i like it a done up priscilla whispers to a room full of men elvis among them
the trailer hints that some of the couple s many tribulations will be addressed including issues regarding fidelity and drug use
curiously the soundtrack for the trailer does not feature any of elvis s music as coppola reportedly was denied access by his estate
this however isn t felt as acutely since the focus of the story seemingly remains on priscilla who is shown holding their baby girl lisa marie presley and in another scene decked out in a grandiose bridal gown for the pair s iconic wedding
lisa marie presley died in january at the age of from complications from prior weight loss surgery
the last shot reveals her in a car waiting for the gates of what looks to be graceland to open as she s heard in voice over saying i want a life of my own
priscilla presley now has been back in the spotlight over the last year
she was present at many promotional events and awards shows for baz luhrmann s biopic elvis from last year which primarily focused on the late singer and boasted an oscar nominated performance from austin butler
priscilla will be in theaters on november
