one of the most recognizable people in the world david beckham has a well trodden story a former england soccer captain married to a spice girl and now the owner of major league soccer club inter miami
brand beckham swept the world in the s and s propelling david and victoria beckham to an international stardom reserved for those who transcend the bounds of their celebrity careers and become pop culture icons of their era
it seems impossible to learn any more about beckham but there are several revelations contained in the eponymous netflix documentary released on wednesday directed by succession star fisher stevens who sketches a complex portrait of the soccer star
while already independently famous the marriage between posh and becks catapulted both of them into another sphere of celebrity uniting the worlds of soccer pop culture music and later fashion
but as it turns out victoria beckham is not into football and never will be she says in the documentary despite marrying one of the sport s most recognizable figures
both of them recall their first meeting and the early days of their fledgling relationship meeting in car parks and kissing in cars in an attempt to keep it a secret
it s less seedy than it sounds victoria quips
she gave her number to her future husband written on a plane ticket after attending a manchester united game with fellow spice girl mel c
but the image of a blissful marriage cracked in april when the now defunct british newspaper news of the world printed allegations that beckham had had an affair after his transfer to real madrid
while the couple don t directly address the content of the allegations in the documentary they each speak about the impact that it and the media coverage had on their marriage
i don t know how we got through it in all honesty beckham said haltingly in the documentary
victoria is everything to me
to see her hurt was incredibly difficult what we had was worth fighting for
for her part victoria says that it was the hardest period in their marriage because it felt like the world was against us and we were against each other
for all the magical moments that beckham enjoyed on the soccer field there was one incident that threatened to overshadow his career when he was given a red card for tripping diego simeone during england s round of match against argentina in the world cup
england went on to lose that match on penalties and crashed out of the world cup unleashing a tidal wave of abuse towards beckham
it was public bullying on another level victoria said saying that it left her husband clinically depressed and broken
beckham s friend and business partner david gardner said he remembers people spitting at and barging into the soccer player in the street or banging on their car windows at traffic lights
the abuse beckham said left him feeling very vulnerable and alone during that time but that he finds it hard to talk through what i went through because it was so extreme the whole country hated me
he added that he still beats himself up about the red card years later
after retiring from football beckham has become a co owner of inter miami and found some other ways to occupy his time too including beekeeping and cooking
the series begins with him beekeeping harvesting honey from a hive of bees that flows into an old jam jar
beckham jokes that it should be called golden bees an apparent allusion to his one time nickname golden balls while his wife he says with a wry smile thinks it should be called db sticky stuff lego is another of his hobbies he tells documentary director fisher stevens
coming full circle the four part documentary ends with him cooking with his family in a sunroom a place where he potters around on a saturday spending the day grilling while watching football on his ipad
sometimes professional commitments impacted on important moments in beckham s family life
one example is when he had to break the news to his wife that the birth of their third son cruz would clash with his photoshoot with pop icons beyonc and jennifer lopez
i was like seriously i am about to burst
i m on bed rest
are you kidding me victoria says years later in the documentary
you ve got a damn photoshoot with jennifer lopez who is gorgeous and not about to have a baby
so i had my c section and i remember lying there don t feel at my most gorgeous let s just say
on the front pages of the newspapers victoria remembers was a photo of beckham standing between beyonc and lopez with the headline what would posh say
let me tell you what posh would say she says in the documentary
