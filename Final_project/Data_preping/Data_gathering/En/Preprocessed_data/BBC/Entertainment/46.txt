whether you re gearing up for the next season of hbo s house of the dragon prequel waiting desperately for george r r
martin to publish the next a song of ice and fire installment or rewatching the original series just to feel the pain all over again you can never know too much about game of thrones
well maybe you can
a little refresher on the history can t hurt though
the drama patricide incest betrayal nudity and draconology of the game of thrones books and tv series spans more than years
no don t think too hard about what years are in the fantasy realm of westeros
be thankful there s a point of reference at all because it s about to get complex

how the date system works
the star wars timeline is confusing
here s when the mandalorian ahsoka and more take place
a song of ice and fire time is split into two eras bc and ac or before conquest and after conquest the conquest in question here is aegon s conquest or the moment when the famed targaryen family they of the platinum hair and big dragons become a major player in westeros the fictional anglo inspired realm where most of the game of thrones action takes place
pretty much everything that happens in the game of thrones and house of the dragon series takes place in the ac era so we ll stick to that
all kinds of important lore happens before this era and the histories in the show and the books are so thick that there are inevitably some little in world discrepancies
just use this timeline as a general guide okay there is only so much time one can devote to fantastical history before it becomes madness
the targaryens the ancestors of daenerys jon snow and practically everyone on house of the dragon invade westeros and become its ruling family setting up the capital city of king s landing
that s where the baratheons and lannisters ruled from for nearly the whole game of thrones series ac house of the dragon season
this is where house of the dragon season leaves off
the dance of the dragons is the name for a civil war between factions of house targaryen over who their rightful ruler should be
it is a big part of westerosi history and is set to be the main action in house of the dragon season
no spoilers but a lot of people die
we still haven t gotten to the main game of thrones action but more than a westerosi century after the bloody dance of the dragons targaryens are still in power major got players are being born and events that influence the whole series start to play out
aerys ii was the mad king who was eventually slain by jaime lannister and marked the end of the unbroken centuries during which targaryens ruled westeros
another crucial moment in westerosi history this is when robert baratheon wrests power from the targaryens
also around this time rhaegar targaryen daenerys brother secretly marries lyanna stark who gives birth to jon snow and then dies rip again setting up one of the biggest and ickiest secrets of the series
finally years after house of the dragon season begins we get to the main action
from here on out each year roughly corresponds to a season of the show
funny how these things happen
ac game of thrones season asoiaf book a clash of kings
ac game of thrones season asoiaf book a storm of swords
no that is not a typo
starting this season the timing of the show starts to pull away significantly from the timing of the books
some events from different books overlap in the same season and some events in the same book are more spread out
take it up with george r r
martin
the action of this season supposedly aligns with the sixth asoiaf book the winds of winter hard to tell since we are still waiting for its release
