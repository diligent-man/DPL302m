As far as Stevie Nicks is concerned Fleetwood Mac is no more
The singer talked to Vulture about the life and death of her best friend and bandmate Christine McVie who died in November at the age of following a brief illness
Nicks told the publication that the last time the band toured together their An Evening with Fleetwood Mac ran from to they had a really great time and it was a huge tour and there was a possibility they would do it again
But when Christine died I felt like you can’t replace her Nicks said
Without her what is it You know what I mean
Nicks continued She was like my soul mate my musical soul mate and my best friend that I spent more time with than any of my other best friends outside of Fleetwood Mac
When I think about Taylor Swift’s song ‘You’re on Your Own Kid’ and the line ‘you always have been’ it was like that was Christine and I NIcks said of her fellow singer songwriter
We were on our own in that band
Who am I going to look over to on the right and have them not be there behind that Hammond organ she added
When she died I figured we really can’t go any further with this
McVie wrote andor performed several of Fleetwood Mac’s hits including Don’t Stop Over My Head You Make Loving Fun and Say You Love Me
