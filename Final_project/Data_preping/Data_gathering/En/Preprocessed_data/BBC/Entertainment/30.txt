in the year history of hip hop there have never been two stars whose lives and deaths have been more examined than tupac shakur and christopher wallace the rapper known professionally as the notorious b i g
or biggie smalls
both men are as beloved and missed now as they were almost years ago when they were killed shakur in september in las vegas and wallace in march in los angeles
we lost two giants senselessly rapper fat joe told cnn
that s what bothers me when it comes to biggie and pac
we lost two giants over nothing
their deaths are now being revisited after duane keith davis known as keffe d was arrested last month for the death of shakur years after the rapper was shot as he was leaving a boxing match on the las vegas strip
body camera of davis arrest shows him referring to the murder as the biggest case in las vegas history
but shakur s death reverberated well beyond the borders of nevada and foreshadowed that of wallace
the question now is when or if an arrest will be made in connection to the death of wallace
the murders of the two influential rappers who started as friends and later became rivals have always been culturally connected because of both the time period and the circumstances
it was almost like the death of tupac was the first movie and then biggie was the sequel p
frank williams who produced the television special who shot biggie and tupac told cnn
the two biggest deaths in the history of hip hop
both men came from impoverished backgrounds were raised by single mothers whom they cherished and honored via the music that made them famous
each had run ins with the law earlier in their lives before being heralded as artistic superstars who were untouchable when it came to their craft
the pair were also at the center of the east coast vs
west coast rap beef in the s after shakur a west coast based artist became convinced that wallace who was from brooklyn helped set him up to be shot five times in a manhattan recording studio in
wallace denied any involvement and was never charged in connection to the crime
ultimately both were victims of fatal drive by shootings while out with others for a night of partying
there is even a connection between the investigations into their deaths
now retired los angeles police department detective greg kading interviewed davis in as a person of interest in the death of wallace as davis had been present at a party at the peterson automotive museum in los angeles which wallace had left just before he was shot
in a transcript of a clark county grand jury proceeding from last month retired las vegas metropolitan police detective clifford mogg said that investigators theorized shakur s murder and wallace s were related
mogg didn t specify what their theory was but testified davis was not involved
another person who was in la the night wallace died was cheo hodari coker
while he s gone on to work in film and television with credits including netflix s luke cage back then coker was a journalist on assignment to talk to wallace for what would turn out to be the rapper s final interview
coker said he was supposed to be in the entourage traveling with wallace when he was killed but the rapper failed to call him back to connect
shakur s and wallace s deaths are linked by both history and emotion coker said and have come to reverberate all the more in the years that have passed
not just dead murdered
and i think that sometimes in our celebration of the music and of them that does get lost over the years coker said
these were deliberate deaths on somebody s behalf and that stings so much
particularly as all of us who have been around this are now in our fifties and we understand how much life you have lost when you die at and
those unfulfilled futures are especially haunting to coker who said his final conversation with wallace focused on his childhood and aspirations that may be surprising to those who viewed him only through his rhymes
basically the life that he described was being a soccer dad in atlanta coker said
he just wanted to give his daughter away at her wedding play with his kids and he wanted to build a house in atlanta
shakur was also a man who was multifaceted
williams who as a journalist covered shakur s murder for the los angeles times and wallace s for the source magazine recalled a latino grandmother calling in to a los angeles radio station after the death of shakur to talk about how much his song dear mama meant to her
yet he was the same man who sported a thug life tattoo on his stomach and was one of the reigning stars of hardcore rap
tupac reached people on an emotional and spiritual level williams said
he d go from his single wonda why they call u b ch to dear mama which was talking about the human experience
that was the kind of stuff he talked about which is a far cry from the image that you have of him
biggie on a lyrical storytelling level is probably one of the best he said of wallace
i think he was a superstar and was beloved for his music and his craftsmanship as a writer and artist
they both were gifts at that time
coker is hopeful that with the renewed spotlight on shakur s death there will be movement on wallace s case
cnn has reached out to the los angeles police department for comment on wallace s murder investigation
i m hoping that with pressure comes revelation coker said
revelation and perhaps eventually some measure of justice for his loved ones
those close to wallace and shakur are still waiting
we re in a constant state of grief and remorse and pain because we have to relive it and relive what happened mopreme shakur shakur s stepbrother told cnn last week
we have been through decades of pain
