In the light of what s happened in Israel and Gaza a song about non violence seems somewhat ridiculous even laughable but our prayers have always been for peace and for non violence Bono told the Las Vegas audience But our hearts and our anger you know where that s pointed So sing with us and those beautiful kids at that music festival
Israeli officials counted at least bodies near the site of the festival where earlier footage showed carefree partygoers from Israel and overseas dancing in the desert soon after sunrise on Saturday
Some survivors are among more than hostages that the militant group Hamas claims to be holding in Gaza according to friends and family members who have seen them in videos shared on social platforms
It was a festival of music and peace Bono told the audience A festival of music and peace Can you imagine

Early morning October th he sang The sun is rising in the desert sky Stars of David they took your life But they could not take your pride
