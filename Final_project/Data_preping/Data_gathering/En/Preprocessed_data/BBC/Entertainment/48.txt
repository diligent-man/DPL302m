nostalgia only goes so far with the super models a four part apple tv docuseries as glossy as a high end fashion magazine of yore and often as slim as one from the internet age
naomi campbell cindy crawford linda evangelista and christy turlington burns lead this strut down memory lane punctuated by occasional highlights but ultimately more celebratory than revelatory
focusing on four marquee models who came of age in the s certainly has potential and the bond that the women share both then and now brings an underlying warmth to the overall journey
the subject matter however ends up being fractured not only among their individual stories but those surrounding a shifting business covering too much ground in a way that takes its access to this exclusive sorority and yields something that s often not much more than skin deep
the first chapter dutifully deals with how and where each of the four were noticed and broke into modeling in campbell s case without her mother s knowledge
crawford s younger brother had died of leukemia while evangelista had steadfastly pursued a modeling career from an early age
their maturation into the business highlights the power of magazines at the time and the importance of being on the cover of vogue
yet these models established their individual brands before referring to people as such was well fashionable with donatella versace calling them the first influencers of fashion
in the process those who became known as super models created a pop culture footprint like few before them taking control over their careers and images in a way that transcended fashion while amassing the wealth fame and occasionally messy relationships that went with it
that influence included branching out into other media commercials and videos yes but also ventures like crawford s show for mtv in its early days as well as bringing their star quality to the runway with designer isaac mizrahi amusingly recalling his conservative then something mother saying after one of the shows i would have sex with naomi campbell
still directors roger ross williams and larissa bills have almost too much material to wrestle into shape from evangelista s heath struggles and marriage to elite models executive g rald marie to campbell s grief after the murder of gianni versace her substance abuse issues and later her helping contemporaries with their own
the appearance in george michael s freedom video nicely encapsulates the apex of their moment but of course the world didn t stand still as times and styles changed from grunge to a wave of european supermodels and the waif look embodied by kate moss
we thought maybe you d have a five year career says crawford who recently reprised her pepsi look for the one margarita music video marveling at how this quartet has evolved and endured
at its best the super models paints an empowering portrait of how these women gained and exercised clout shaking up their industry while getting slapped with labels like difficult in response
that s certainly a story worth telling
yet the project likely would have possessed more impact had that thread been followed as more of a direct line instead of obscuring the focus with all those admittedly occasionally fun digressions and detours
