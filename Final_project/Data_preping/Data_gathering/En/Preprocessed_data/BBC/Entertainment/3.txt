fat joe is hosting the bet hip hop awards for the second year in a row
he couldn t be more thrilled especially given that this year marks the th anniversary of hip hop
hosting for the th anniversary is beyond an honor he told cnn
any year that i host the bet hip hop awards i m like a kid in the candy store
he said the ceremony which was filmed in atlanta georgia last week and airs tuesday is a big one as it honors the artists producers and djs that have helped make the genre great
it also marks the th anniversary of his debut studio album represent which fat joe is keeping low key
i don t really celebrate so much the anniversaries because i m always just in real time he said
so i don t really think about the past
i just move forward and try to push the legacy as forward in as real time as possible
that means celebrating both the newer artists as well as those who have come before
while some have complained that the more recent artists are not as talented as some of the older ones fat joe doesn t play that game
he recalled being a teen an attending a panel when one of the rap legends on that panel was critical of an up and coming rap group
i was like man this guy s a hater
i can t believe he s a hater the rapper recalled
and i said if i become successful i ll never be that guy
now that he is that successful fat joe said he tries always to be supportive of those coming up in the rap game
whether i like the music or i don t i always encourage the youth to do better to keep rocking to uplift the hip hop community to hire more people take care of their kids he said
that s what i m about
i don t really throw shade on the youth rather than complain that today s hip hop is not like that of yesteryear fat joe said he focuses on continuing to grow as a artist and even as a host for the awards show
with age comes wisdom and so you learn how to move differently you learn how to make music differently
you learn how to talk about different things he said
my whole life has been a work in progress
whether it may be as an artist as a stage performer as a host or having tv shows all my life has just been practice makes perfect
the bet hip hop awards will air on oct
