we still have books to write songs to sing and a special friendship to keep us in each other s lives forever

it was very unexpected
it s funny because we know all the same people
we have all the same friends and we ve been in the same rooms before but we ve never connected so it was interesting metz said at the time
we really got a chance to know each other because you can t get to smooching too soon when you re social distance dating
it s helpful guys
