you re out for a hike on a glorious fall day
suddenly you spot a bear
and the bear has spotted you too
would you know what to do next
beth pratt sure would
she was once on the old gardiner road trail in yellowstone national park enjoying her run in wild nature
her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers
i stopped
it stood on its hind legs and looked at me
i knew that wasn t a threatening gesture she told cnn travel
i m not kidding it waved its paw at me as if to say just go on your way and went back to eating
and i walked slowly away and put some distance between us and the encounter ended fine
when it comes to dealing with bears pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us though
she is the california regional executive director for the national wildlife federation a job she s had for more than years
she worked in yellowstone for several years and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there
finally she lives on the border of yosemite national park and bears will pass through her yard including this one seen in the footage above in late september
you can hear the enthusiasm in pratt s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear human encounters are delightful not dangerous
a wild bear is a beautiful sight to see
it s incredible to see them in the wild
i never had a bad experience with bears
what i try to get people to feel is respect not fear for bears
the animal usually wants to avoid the encounters
bear attacks are rare pratt and us national park service websites point out but they do happen
two people died in a suspected grizzly bear attack in canada s banff national park in late september
an adult grizzly bear that had killed a woman this past summer was euthanized in early september after breaking into a home through a kitchen window with her cub
a man in his s was killed by a bear in arizona as he sat at his campsite in june
two collegiate wrestlers were mauled by a grizzly bear near cody wyoming in october they had serious injuries but survived
a year old hunter was seriously injured by a bear in france in november
all illustrate the point that rare doesn t equal never
while it pays to be diligent at any time autumn is a particularly good season to bone up on bear facts and safety when many bears are in a phase known as hyperphagia pratt said
it s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation
she noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters
not bears
they eat everything ants
roadkill
flowers
and unfortunately human food that s not secured
our food is very attractive to them it s easy calories

combine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded and you have a recipe for potential trouble
if more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix there s more potential for encounters and conflict
it does concern me a little bit pratt said
the key is being prepared and that s where pratt and others in the know come in
the best strategy is to never get in harm s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear
trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter
that s just looking for trouble
the us national park service site points out each bear and each encounter is different but there are general guidelines useful in most situations
first of all keep your distance if you happen upon a bear
don t approach it and give it plenty of room to walk away from you
yellowstone tells you to stay at least yards feet or meters away shenandoah national park in virginia suggests feet meters for its black bears
you can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and end up paying a fine
other tips
talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human
walk with a group we re smellier and noisier in packs and stay on designated trails
if you have a small child or dog pick it up
don t put yourself between cubs and their mother
avoid direct eye contact and move away slowly sideways if possible
pratt said don t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs it s not considered an aggressive move
almost all encounters are peaceful pratt said
many times people never knew they were even close to a bear as in this youtube video that shows two people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear
if a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction you have important decisions to make and fast
first thing is stand your ground with bears
with either grizzlies a subspecies of brown bears or black bears please don t run
bears can outrun anybody pratt said
don t climb a tree either
they can also climb trees better than you
new jersey department of environmental protection division of fish and wildlife where the black bear population is growing also has some tips
make loud noises by yelling banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away
make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms
if you re with other people stay together
pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations depending on the bear species and the situation
you re now in the rarest of situations you ve attracted a bear s attention
it didn t move off
it s started coming at you aggressively and fast
you think you re about to be attacked
what s next
one very crucial thing is to make a quick id of the kind of bear because your strategy is going to be different depending on the type of bear
if it s a black bear the nps and pratt have a clear message do not run
do not play dead
you want to stand your ground with black bears
look as intimidating as possible pratt said
throw things not at it but near it
make that black bear intimidated by you
let it know you are a big person
pick something up yell at it
if it attacks fight back aim for the face
if you re dealing with a grizzly that won t back off and an attack is imminent you re advised to do the opposite
you should play dead
act as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly
play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack pratt said
tuck and cover
get into a fetal position
wrap your hands around your neck
lay on your stomach
once you do that percent of the time the grizzly will move on
i was up to my waist down a hippo s throat he survived and here s his advice
nps elaborates remain still until the bear leaves the area
fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks
however if the attack persists fight back vigorously
fighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort your hail mary pass as pratt called it when all other options are out
an exception to this rule if you re camping in a tent and are attacked that bear likely sees you as food
nps and pratt say this is a time to fight
first off know your area and read up on the bears there
in north america grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do
in the lower they are in washington montana idaho and wyoming
and then in alaska too
they also cover large parts of western canada
black bears have more territory
they can be found in as many as us states much of canada and even parts of northern mexico the national wildlife federation says
so say you re in quebec the appalachians the ozarks california or even parts of florida that s going to be a black bear
but if you re in yellowstone or glacier national park for instance that could be a black bear or a grizzly
that s when it s crucial to know how to make a quick visual id
you can t go by the color of the fur
black bears can be black brown cinnamon blond blue gray or white according to bear org
one of the best ways to tell the difference pratt said is to look for a hump at the shoulders
grizzlies have them
black bears don t
she also said the face shapes are different
black bear faces look a little more cuddly to me a little rounder with a straight nose
a grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape
this nps webpage has more helpful ways to tell the differences
fun facts eight bear species can be found all over the world from tropical sri lanka to the frigid reaches of russia norway and canada
and european websites such as bear watching slovenia give many of the same safety tips as north americans get
some people like to carry bear spray and or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country
pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild
nps has a helpful video and tips on using spray to ward off bears
she s more cautious about bringing firearms with you especially if you re inexperienced
taking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough
you need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety

human fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed patterson said

pratt emphasized it s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures
the bears are just being bears
we are way more of a threat to them
bear attacks are so rare
and fatalities are even rarer she said
the bears lives are more at threat than ours in encounters
i want people to have magical wonderful experiences in the wild
i want people to feel ok about having these encounters
