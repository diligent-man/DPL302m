the flight seemed too good to be true
when martina jones got the text with the details she scrutinized them for several minutes
it was a round trip flight departing from either washington d c
or new york city flying to nairobi kenya
of course this was a great deal i wanted to take advantage of it martina tells cnn travel today
but it was also very weird i thought it might be a scam
it was november the day after martina s th birthday
the flight was scheduled for the following march
after weighing up the options and doing some research martina decided to bite the bullet and buy the ticket
then she sent the deal round her various group chats encouraging more of her friends to sign up
martina fell in love with travel during her stint studying abroad in london
after graduating college she taught english in south korea and then backpacked around southeast asia
i m a traveler through and through says martina
it gives me life
in several years into her new jersey based sales job martina was feeling a little disillusioned and bored by work
but she kept herself motivated by counting down the days until her next trip
across the hudson river in new york city leslie johnson also received a text from a friend with the nairobi flight details
like martina leslie was skeptical the price seemed too good to be true
and to get the deal you had to follow a series of random links it really did seem like a potential con
but the friend who d forwarded the deal to leslie was a seasoned flyer
they d found the details via a travel group for black travelers
leslie who traveled a bit here and there but not too crazy just enough to get one or two passport stamps a year trusted their judgment so decided to go for it
his confirmation email didn t arrive for a couple days
leslie spent that waiting period still slightly convinced he d been scammed
finally the details came through
then i knew it was good leslie recalls
march rolled around
the first leg of the flight from the us to amsterdam was uneventful
in amsterdam martina attempted to amend her booking so she could sit with her friends she was traveling with five others and they were all at the back of the plane while she was sitting on her own at the front
the gate agent advised martina to ask her fellow passengers if they d mind moving
but when martina asked no one would budge so she settled down to her textbooks instead martina was studying for the gmat a business school admissions test and figured she could use the long flight time to get in some study
by chance leslie was also separated from his friend on this leg of the flight
and by coincidence he was seated directly in front of martina
he was immediately struck by martina and intrigued by her
he d also studied for the gmat in the past so once the airplane had taken off from schiphol airport leslie plucked up the courage to speak to martina using the test and the textbook as an entryway
from there the conversation never let up
we talked the entire flight says martina
we had a really good conversation
we talked the entire flight
we had a really good conversation
martina jones johnson
throughout the hours long chat martina remained sat in her seat while leslie knelt backwards on his looking back at her
there was a seat next to martina but leslie didn t want to overstep any boundaries by inviting himself to sit there
as the aircraft made its way south leslie and martina spoke about jobs travel their interests and their lives and realized they lived a seven minute drive from each other on opposite sides of the hudson river
almost every key topic was covered but the two danced around the topic of their respective relationship statuses
in the back of my head i m thinking if he s single we re going to date but i didn t know if he was single recalls martina
before they landed in nairobi martina asked leslie for his phone number but in the context of networking
leslie had been talking about a friend who worked in tv production and martina was interested in getting into that world
and then we went our separate ways she says
while nothing obviously romantic had happened martina disembarked the plane with that same feeling of certainty we re going to be together
there was something in the way they spoke to each other
something about the way they looked at each other
but most of all it was the ease martina felt in his company
a couple of her friends spotted the connection too
oh he s cute
i saw you said one of them nudging martina as they disembarked the plane
over the next week martina and leslie enjoyed their respective adventures in and around nairobi
they both thought about one another from time to time but mostly focused on enjoying their travels
then on the very last day or his last day i was staying a day longer we ended up at the same restaurant says martina
it was a seafood restaurant martina s favorite but far from leslie s first choice
he hates seafood and when his friend suggested it he d considered vetoing the idea but then decided he didn t want to be that person
so he ended up against the odds at a restaurant where he couldn t eat almost anything on the menu
and then he spotted martina and he forgot all about the food
she saw him too
they didn t meet each other s gaze
instead they both stole glances when they thought the other wasn t looking
i was excited to see him says martina
but i was also playing it very cool
leslie got up several times and walked by martina s table hoping she might spot him and speak to him
i went to the restroom
didn t think she caught my attention
so i end up going back like two or three more times and still didn t make any kind of eye contact with her he says
but then coincidentally leslie and martina both ended up leaving the restaurant at the same time
the restaurant was in a hotel so the two ended up standing in the lobby together both with their friends in tow chatting for a bit
it was says martina a little awkward
but she still left with that same thought if he s single we re going to have a moment
it s weird because it was just a matter of fact feeling says martina today
it wasn t necessarily like oh i just met this guy i m so excited it was just a very calm matter of fact we just had a great conversation
he seems like a great person
and if he s single that s it
we re going to date
leslie was single
just before he flew to nairobi he d deleted the dating apps he d been using off and on for the past couple of years
i live in new york city he thought
there s no way i can t meet someone in person
on past travels he d daydreamed about meeting someone at the airplane gate or boarding the airplane and catching someone s eye
but he d never thought it would actually happen
and when it did actually happen it just felt natural
everything just kind of seemed like it was meant to be or just was happening for a reason says leslie
everything just kind of seemed like it was meant to be or just was happening for a reason
leslie johnson
a few days later once martina and leslie were both home in the us martina sent him a text
how s jet lag treating you she wrote
from there they messaged back and forth for a day or two comparing what they d each got up to in nairobi
then leslie invited martina to dinner
he picked out a south african restaurant in midtown
martina lived right on the edge of new jersey and could usually get into new york city within minutes
but that day the traffic was terrible
in stationary traffic martina sat behind the wheel fretting leslie would think she d stood him up and just leave
she called him to explain and apologize
leslie told her not to worry
he wasn t going anywhere
an hour and a half later martina arrived
when she walked up i remember thinking she was even cuter than i remembered says leslie
when we first met i believe her hair was straight
and at that time it was really curly and i was like oh this is really cute
martina and leslie settled quickly back into the easy conversation they d enjoyed on the plane
and then at the end of the night they realized they were both flying out of newark airport the next day
the easter weekend was approaching and they were both traveling to visit their families martina was heading back to ohio and leslie to michigan
so the very next day we met up at the airport before our flight says martina
i always say our second date was at the airport
over the next few days martina and leslie texted non stop
three dates turned into four and then five and then they quickly lost count
we were constantly in touch says leslie
it was very easy says martina
there were no gray areas
we liked each other and we hung out we spent time together
a month or so later leslie went to san francisco for a work trip and martina joined him for part of the time
it was their first trip together and was shortly followed by their second a weekend away with martina s friends at a beach house in delaware
martina was also busy planning her next big adventure a trip to costa rica in november to coincide with her th birthday
she d invited her closest friends to join her
only weeks after meeting leslie she invited him too
the trip was still months away and the relationship was still new
it was a little intimidating but leslie tried not to worry about this
he knew he wanted things to work out and wanted to be there
i m an overthinker he says
and the more i overthink the more i stop making moves
i told myself not to overthink this
there were a couple of bumps in the road by the summer martina was getting frustrated at leslie s hesitation to label the relationship
this conversation came to a head in july three months or so after they d got together
but after this their first proper argument martina and leslie confirmed that yes they were in a relationship
and yes they both wanted to see where it went next
and yes they couldn t wait
she broke up with her boyfriend and moved in with a man she d known for weeks
here s what happened next
travel quickly became a cornerstone of leslie and martina s relationship
we really enjoyed each other and we traveled a lot says leslie
so that was cool for both of us to have someone to travel with
martina was the more adventurous of the two so she encouraged leslie to get outside of his comfort zone
the couple realized they traveled well together with good synergy as they put it
in a lot of different ways it just all seemed to work just seemed like the perfect situation
perfect match for us says leslie
around a year and a half after their airplane meeting in december leslie and martina traveled to london together
it was a city that meant a lot to both of them martina studied there while leslie has family in the uk
leslie figured london was the perfect location for a proposal
leslie and martina had spoken about marriage and both saw it as the next step so the proposal wouldn t be a surprise but leslie wanted to surprise martina in the moment
he enlisted the help of his london based cousins asking if they could also get a bunch of their friends on board
leslie arranged that he and martina would walk by tower bridge a famous london landmark just as night fell
once there they d be approached by a series of seemingly random strangers who were actually friends of his cousins on a mission
each stranger handed martina a rose and a piece of paper with a letter printed on it
the first two interactions just seemed random and martina assumed the strangers were trying to get her to buy the roses
then people started coming thick and fast and soon the letters spelled out a question will you marry me
and once the last person came i got on my knee and asked her says leslie
martina was both overwhelmed and delighted
i was so so happy
it was an incredible feeling
it was just amazing she says
and what made it even more special to me is that it was in london
london is where i got my first passport stamp and really opened up my mind and my heart and is where i truly fell in love with travel
so then to go back to the very first place where it started and now i m getting proposed to by the man that i met on a plane it was really special
martina and leslie say their wedding day in columbus ohio was really beautiful the theme was love at first flight with this slogan emblazoned on the invites and the menus and the couple gave guests luggage tags as party favors
martina jones became martina jones johnson
a whirlwind romance began in a brussels chocolate shop
it turned into a love story spanning nearly years
cut to today and travel remains a big part of martina and leslie s lives
they chronicle their adventures on their instagram account that couple who travels aiming to inspire others to follow in their footsteps
i m so appreciative of the community that we ve built and the opportunities that we re able to have from it says martina
martina and leslie s account includes destination guides flight reviews and recommendations of black owned businesses as well as photographs of the couple on their incredible adventures across the globe
i do love being a representation of a healthy black relationship says martina
i think more people need to see that
this is important to martina and leslie not only in the context of instagram
martina recalls a recent group trip where she and leslie found themselves entirely in the company of older white couples
these people aren t around young black couples
but we just loved each other we just had such a good time with each other sharing our different experiences and bonding over travel she says
and that s what it s all about
i think that s how the world gets better
love is what kills hate and it s what makes fears go away when you have those relationships with people
i love to travel
i traveled and i met the love of my life
so find that thing that you love and you don t know what breadcrumbs that will lead you to
martina jones johnson
looking back on the not actually a scam flight and their fortuitous meeting leads leslie to conclude you just never know what s out there
i met someone who lived not too far away from me but i met them on a plane thousands or whatever miles away from home he says
as for martina she finds herself reflecting on something her best friend said to her long before leslie came into her life
do what you love and it will lead you to everything else
for martina this turned out to be true
i love to travel
i traveled and i met the love of my life
so find that thing that you love and you don t know what breadcrumbs that will lead you to
it might lead you to the love of your life
it might lead you to your purpose you just don t know but we all have unique desires and things that we are passionate about says martina
don t ignore it
don t wait for someone else to go with you
just do what you love and see what happens
