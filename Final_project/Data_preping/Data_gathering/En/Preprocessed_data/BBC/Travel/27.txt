editor s note monthly ticket is a cnn travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world
in september we re celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world s biggest longest and most expensive attractions and destinations
in today s modern age it might be fair to assume that science has decisively answered some of the bigger questions regarding the natural world or at least those dependent upon sheer physical measurements
but one seemingly straightforward conclusion has continued to confound just what is the longest river in the world
indeed in science is still grappling with the answer
the title of world s longest river is officially bestowed upon africa s nile by authoritative sources like encyclopedia britannica and guinness world records
but an upcoming amazon river expedition by a team of international explorers and researchers traveling via rafts horseback and solar paneled boats is readying to contest that designation
the nile is like a worm and the amazon is an anaconda year old brazilian expedition leader yuri sanada a seasoned explorer and film producer recounts of his colleague s metaphorical take on the amazon s volume which carries four times more water than any other river
so there s no comparison we have the biggest river
but the longest we will see
the planned five month long expedition due to set off in april aims to voyage the amazon s full length using modern river mapping satellite technology to scientifically prove once and for all that the amazon is not just the world s most voluminous river but its longest
notably the amazon is not one singular stretch of water but rather part of a greater river system spanning much of northern south america
not dissimilar to the branches of a tree its network includes multiple sources and tributaries
the length dispute largely stems from the issue of where the amazon begins
while britannica and others have traditionally measured the river as starting from the headwaters of the apurimac river in southern peru american neuroscientist turned river expeditionist james rocky contos claims to have discovered a more distant river source the mantaro river in northern peru while researching whitewater rafting routes in the country
i was aware that the most distant source of the amazon was considered to be the apurimac but when i was gathering all information maps hydrographs etc
in preparation for my trip to peru i realized that another river appeared to be longer contos says
two strangers met on the river nile
they ve been married for years
he further verified this information with topographic maps satellite imagery and gps measurements while kayaking there which he published research on in
the discovery of the new source adds kilometers miles to the length of the amazon compared to the previously considered source he says
sanada says contos s findings offer the expedition team an excuse to be there explaining that while mapping the river is its ostensible goal the expedition has greater aims of more fully documenting and shining a global spotlight on the amazon rainforest region s rich biodiversity and the need for the worldwide community to work together to help conserve it
the planned kilometer mile spring expedition route will span the amazon river s course through peru colombia and brazil starting at its newly purported source at the mantaro deep in the peruvian andes
the mantaro s white waters will be navigated on a rafting expedition with contos at the helm once the mantaro meets the ene river the voyage s longer segment will begin aboard a trio of custom built solar and pedal powered boats that will follow the remainder of the amazon out to the atlantic ocean on the brazilian coast
sanada says that in early there will be a secondary expedition starting at the apurimac river in peru the traditionally accepted source of the amazon which will allow for a second set of measurements
this segment will reportedly be accompanied by french explorer celine cousteau granddaughter of famed oceanographer jacques cousteau via horseback ride along the riverbanks
sanada is currently overseeing a team of roughly collaborators on the project from across the americas and europe
the expedition has already secured some prestigious partnerships support from the explorers club an imax deal for a related film production and an assignment to produce a new amazon river map for harvard university
sanada says the expedition will also host a rotating cast of international scientific researchers including from partner universities in brazil peru colombia the us and other countries who will join at different stages with aims of bringing sustainable technology to traditional amazonian communities
these projects will teach them how to treat the water techniques on how to build better houses with natural materials bring electric energy from renewable sources waste treatment electromobility transportation and more he explains
it s going to really change the life of people there
the hybrid solar and pedal powered expedition boats themselves are meant to demonstrate an affordable efficient and pollution reducing alternative to the gas powered motorboats currently in use by the local communities
developed in partnership with a local brazilian university the vessels are being constructed with locally sourced bioresin and natural fibers as well as motors made from d printers
following the expedition boat motors will be donated locally in what sanada calls part of the legacy of the expedition
however despite these optimistic goals this is not a journey without peril
in this kind of expedition a lot of things can go wrong sanada says citing the potential for boats to collapse and wilderness risks the jungle contains jaguars anacondas poisonous frogs and more
the most dangerous part though sanada says is the human interaction he notes every time the team comes across somebody in the wilderness they ll have to wonder are they drug lords are they enemies or just a friendly tribe trying to invite you to have dinner with them
accordingly the expedition team is working with local authorities to secure armed escorts through areas known for illegal mining and drug trafficking the boat cabins are also being outfitted with bullet and arrow proof fibers
and sanada is placing deep trust in his team
i have local guides from the amazon from peru people who really know about the land and know about how to survive there he says
sanada feels the risks are well worth it
you cannot stop because of risk
we are doing this for science
we are bringing this legacy for the amazon he says
he says it s a privilege to be among only roughly explorers and the first south american who have historically attempted to travel the river s full length
ultimately however sanada concedes that the expedition may not reach a conclusive answer about the river s length or successfully prove that it actually is the world s largest
six of the most beautiful sections of the great wall of china
suzanne walther an associate professor of environmental and ocean sciences at the university of san diego who specializes in river systems and measurements explains that challenges with measuring rivers abound owed to the waterways dynamic and complex nature and the potential for varying human interpretations around accepted river sources and endpoints
she notes that rivers can change over time in a variety of ways citing variations in movement the water volume they contain and in their seasonal patterns
you can imagine then that if you re measuring something and it is moving that will actually change the outcome even if you measure it the exact same way she adds
whether it s because of the tools and atmospheric interference or whether it s the human component there s always a little bit of uncertainty with every measure we take
she points out that there s also a certain man made motivation to claiming a superlative geographic feature like the longest river which can boost national pride and offer potential tourism revenue
it gives prestige to a place she says
we place value on those things as humans even if the rivers don t care if they re longer or not
whatever the expedition s outcome sanada says he d like to explore the nile next using the same techniques and methods of measurement
the nile which flows across northeastern africa before reaching the mediterranean sea via egypt also faces debate around its own source with more than one african nation claiming to contain the river s headwaters
so let s see if we survive this first and then we plan the next one sanada says
after the expedition s completion a related full length documentary as well as an imax film is expected to debut in
sanada believes these projects can help boost regional pride and international tourism and in turn conservation efforts in the amazon by demonstrating how valuable it is and why we have to preserve it
ultimately sanada says that record or no record it s all about a search for knowledge
we re going to be showing the world what the amazon is all about
