Computer glitches Air traffic controller shortages Awful weather Holiday crunches So many things can cause a flight to be delayed or canceled
It s no wonder travelers are wary about making it to their destinations on time or at all And even if they make it their lost luggage might not
Here s some general advice for navigating a very complicated and frustrating system when flights are delayed or canceled
Days ahead of the now infamous December bomb cyclone many US airlines offered their passengers a chance to change their flights for no fee
When you know a major weather event is forecast hop on those waiver offers quickly said Scott Keyes the founder of Going com formerly Scott s Cheap Flights The early birds have the best choices of the remaining worms that is seats and flights
As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time or worse canceled it s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room and make new arrangements from there
Check your flight status before you go the airport Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute said Keyes Save yourself the drive to the airport
Keyes told CNN Travel in an interview that you should sign up for airlines free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket You should also download your carrier s app
You can also put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the status that way That s also handy for friends or family who are on standby to pick you up
Keyes also suggested checking the website FlightAware to track larger flight trends across the country
Sometimes the delays and cancellations happen after you ve arrived at the airport Once the bad news has been delivered what should you do
Keyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents desk and get ready to multitask while you re in line
Fast is a key word here It s going to make a difference who arrives first It s first come first serve Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off Keyes said
Then you might want to call up your carrier while you re waiting Depending on your spot in line it might be faster to get through to a call center Whatever happens first great he said
Calls to US domestic numbers might have really long waits Keyes suggested trying an international call center for your carrier instead
Most US based travelers aren t thinking to call the Canadian help line for Delta You might get through to an agent much quicker They can all handle your reservations just the same
You can also use a self serve kiosk American Airlines says Scan your boarding pass or enter your record locator to see your updated trip details From there you can also switch your flight and print your new boarding passes
The travel advice website Travel Lens suggests using social media to your advantage
Not all customer service teams are as helpful as they should be and getting in touch with them via a phone call isn t always easy it told CNN Travel in an email
Airlines value their reputation on social media and platforms like Twitter are a great way to get in contact with an employee If you do use Twitter to reach out then it s important to remain polite and calm as this will work in your favor
Whether you re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone how you approach things can make a big difference That starts with attitude
Honey attracts more flies than vinegar Keyes said Look at this from the airline agents perspective They ve been dealing with irate customers really since the pandemic began The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you
Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it
He had another tip when it s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements Come prepared to offer your own options already Doing your own research is absolutely helpful
Your agent can expedite things if you ve already looked up new routes and possible suggestions while you ve been waiting Be ready to explain what you want
If you ve booked through Expedia or another third party site you ll have to deal through them when there s a cancellation
What should I do if my luggage is delayed lost or damaged
If the price is the same Keyes suggested you book directly with the airline In case something goes wrong it makes it much more complicated with multiple sets of policies when you booked via a third party
US PIRG a consumer advocacy group suggests you avoid layovers when booking if possible The more times you stop the more chances for something to go wrong
The group also backs up the advice from Keyes to be nice and polite to agents but also says consumers should be persistent in trying to get the situation resolved satisfactorily
Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor
When flights are canceled many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier s flight because they have interline agreements Lousson Smith product operations specialist at Going com told CNN Travel in June
This means for example if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination you may be able to get on that flight
If you elect not to be accommodated on a later flight and you book a new ticket out of your own pocket you are entitled to a cash refund though that may not help you get to where you need to go Smith said As we all know last minute flights are very expensive
What do you do if it looks like you re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you re not in your home city
Ask the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher They might do it they might not It s not required by law Keyes said
They re less likely to do it if it s weather related he said than if the problem is a mechanical issue with the plane or staffing issues
Many airlines have committed to offering meal and hotel vouchers in certain cases The US Department of Transportation has a dashboard that tracks those commitments
What you might get depends on the airline itself and the specific circumstances on why a flight was canceled
cost saving tips for travelers in these inflationary times
Get to know policies For instance Delta Air Lines says it will provide a hotel voucher in some circumstances when the delay is between p m to a m
Whatever you do at least ask Keyes said A voucher for hotels and even ground transport and meals aren t likely to just be offered
Also your credit card could be your friend in this situation
The good news is that many credit cards offer travel protections such as reimbursement if a flight cancellation forces you to get a hotel meals etc Smith said These travel protections are typically included automatically as long as you used the card to pay for your flight Google your credit card plus travel protections to see what specific offerings your card carries
If your flight is delayed instead of outright canceled you might want to weigh whether to wait at the airport Depending your personal circumstances hunkering down there for five or six hours might be easier than going to and from a hotel Also Keyes said check whether there is a hotel within the airport
The Points Guy advises trying to get into an airport lounge if you can where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily
Stay safe If extreme weather is causing air travel disruption trying to make the journey by road could be hazardous Frustrating though it is to stay put it s always better to arrive late than not at all
Consider buying travel insurance advises Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel
It said most travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty Additional coverage usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than hours due to a strike adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown
The site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases You can try to get the money back from the airline later
But keep it to the basics Airlines only pay for reasonable expenses though so you are unlikely to get money back for purchases such as alcohol expensive meals or extravagant hotels
The US Department of Transportation says you are entitled to a refund of your ticket cost because of a cancellation or significant delay and you choose not to travel
This is the policy regardless of the reason the airline cancels or delays the flight However what constitutes a significant delay remains open to interpretation
According to the DOT website it has not specifically defined what constitutes a significant delay Whether you are entitled to a refund depends on many factors including the length of the delay the length of the flight and your particular circumstances DOT determines whether you are entitled to a refund following a significant delay on a case by case basis
Tomasz Pawliszyn CEO of AirHelp said in an email to CNN Travel that flyers should try to avoid vouchers
If travelers are denied boarding they should not volunteer their seat in exchange for perks or a voucher If they do they could be giving up their right to any additional compensation Pawliszyn said Of course if the airline makes a compelling enough offer they may prefer to take it
