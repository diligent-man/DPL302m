today modern age might fair assume science ha decisively answered bigger question regarding natural world least dependent upon sheer physical measurements
one seemingly straightforward conclusion ha continued confound longest river world
title world longest river officially bestowed upon africa nile authoritative source like encyclopedia britannica guinness world records
upcoming amazon river expedition team international explorer researcher traveling via raft horseback solar-paneled boat readying contest designation
nile like worm amazon anaconda year-old brazilian expedition leader yuri sanada seasoned explorer film producer recount colleague metaphorical take amazon volume carry four time water river
planned five-month-long expedition due set april aim voyage amazon full length using modern river-mapping satellite technology scientifically prove amazon world voluminous river longest
notably amazon one singular stretch water rather part greater river system spanning much northern south america
dissimilar branch tree network includes multiple source tributaries
britannica others traditionally measured river starting headwater apurimac river southern peru american neuroscientist-turned-river expeditionist james rocky conto claim discovered distant river source mantaro river northern peru researching whitewater rafting route country
wa aware distant source amazon wa considered apurimac wa gathering information map hydrographs etc
- preparation trip peru realized another river appeared longer conto says

discovery new source add kilometer mile length amazon compared previously considered source says
sanada say conto finding offer expedition team excuse explaining mapping river ostensible goal expedition ha greater aim fully documenting shining global spotlight amazon rainforest region rich biodiversity need worldwide community work together help conserve it
planned kilometer mile spring expedition route span amazon river course peru colombia brazil starting newly purported source mantaro deep peruvian andes
mantaros white water navigated rafting expedition conto helm mantaro meet ene river voyage longer segment begin aboard trio custom-built solar- pedal-powered boat follow remainder amazon atlantic ocean brazilian coast
sanada say early secondary expedition starting apurimac river peru traditionally accepted source amazon allow second set measurements

ultimately however sanada concedes expedition may reach conclusive answer river length successfully prove actually world largest
suzanne walther associate professor environmental ocean science university san diego specializes river system measurement explains challenge measuring river abound owed waterway dynamic complex nature potential varying human interpretation around accepted river source endpoints
note river change time variety way citing variation movement water volume contain seasonal patterns
imagine youre measuring something moving actually change outcome even measure exact way adds
whether tool atmospheric interference whether human component always little bit uncertainty every measure take
point also certain man-made motivation claiming superlative geographic feature like longest river boost national pride offer potential tourism revenue
place value thing human even river dont care theyre longer not
whatever expedition outcome sanada say hed like explore nile next using technique method measurement
nile flow across northeastern africa reaching mediterranean sea via egypt also face debate around source one african nation claiming contain river headwaters
let see survive first plan next one sanada says
