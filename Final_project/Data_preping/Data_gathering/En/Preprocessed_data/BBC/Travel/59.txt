Plans have been revealed for what promises to be London’s most spectacular underground tourist attraction ever the million transformation of a mile-long series of World War II tunnels into a glitzy immersive experience
So clandestine they were once protected by the UK’s Official Secrets Act the former spy tunnels are set to be reworked by a team including the architects behind Singapore’s Gardens by the Bay and London’s Battersea Power Station if it secures planning approval later this fall
The Kingsway Exchange Tunnels some meters below Chancery Lane tube station in High Holborn were built in the s to shelter Londoners from the Blitz bombing campaign during World War II
That was the last time they were open to the general public
Their next wartime role was as the home of Britain’s top-secret Special Operations Executive an offshoot of MI and the real-life inspiration for James Bond’s Q Branch
Historic war office used by Winston Churchill is transformed into luxury Raffles London hotel
Next they were expanded to become the Kingsway Telephone Exchange which in the s served as an internal communications exchange during the Cold War
It even hosted the hot line which directly connected the leaders of the United States and the USSR
The exchange was home to a heaving network of trunk cables and a busy community of workers manning the phone lines
British Telecom took over the site in the s creating the world’s deepest licensed bar for use by the government staff complete with a games room containing snooker tables and a tropical fish tank - the height of ‘s luxury
The technology behind the telephone center became obsolete by the end of the decade and was decommissioned
But now fund manager Angus Murray CEO of The London Tunnels wants to bring the history of the tunnel to life for visitors with high-resolution immersive screens interactive structures scent-emitting technology and hundreds of pinpoint speakers
The -year-old who spent three years living in the Tower of London
The history of the tunnels their scale and the location between London’s Holborn and the historic Square Mile could make these tunnels one of London’s most popular tourist destinations Murray said in a statement
The plan is to invest £ million million in the restoration work and then another £ million million into all the immersive bells and whistles
With architects Wilkinson-Eyre on board they certainly have a stellar team assembled for this very ambitious of projects - which far outscales anything else on offer in the city
London’s best developed permanent underground tourist attraction currently is the Churchill War Rooms - located just feet below ground level and a fraction of the -square-meter space occupied by the Kingsway Exchange Tunnels
London Underground also periodically puts Hidden London tours exploring the city’s abandoned tube stations and tunnels
The tours are always hugely popular and over-subscribed with tickets snapped up as soon as they’re available
They’re still your best chance of subterranean adventure for a few years yet however as the London Tunnels project if it goes ahead - won’t be welcoming its first awestruck visitors until
It sounds like it could well be worth the wait
