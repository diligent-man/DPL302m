over large swaths of the americas this month and next april too all eyes will be on the skies during two spectacular events
between the ring of fire annular eclipse coming up on october and the total solar eclipse happening on april viewers on land in the united states and neighboring countries are in for two major celestial moments as the moon passes between earth and the sun
and while the total solar eclipse is a bigger draw for most travelers since it promises totality darkness during the moments when the moon covers the sun entirely tourists are targeting areas in the annular eclipse s path too
car sharing website turo reports seeing an uptick in car bookings in major cities in oregon new mexico and texas near the annular eclipse s path
booking com similarly reports increased searches for san antonio texas the largest us city in the annular eclipse s path for the period of october to compared with the same period last year

ct the moon will cover over of the sun s surface as it passes in front of it as opposed to coverage during a total eclipse

for many the event is being seen as a sort of warm up for the total solar eclipse which professor mark littmann calls the gold standard of eclipse viewing
and while it will never get as dark during october s annular eclipse as it does during a total solar eclipse some interesting effects may be possible to observe says littmann a professor of science writing at the university of tennessee and co author of totality the great north american eclipse of
the sky may take on some unusual color in terms of a steely gray flatness blues may be a different color
these things depend on the weather too littman said
it may cool down just a little bit
it gives you a kind of an omen of what a total eclipse would look like
viewing an annular eclipse is far from routine the next one won t happen over the contiguous united states until
for viewers in the path of the eclipse who get a clear sky view on the event at the moment of annularity the ring of fire will not only look really cool says debra ross co chair of the american astronomical society s eclipse task force but drive home earth s place in the universe too with the moon so clearly between us and the sun
for lots of people that s worth traveling for ross says
