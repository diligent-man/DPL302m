to many the southern dalmatian coast is croatia
between split and dubrovnik lie some of the most visited places in the country
at times it can feel as if this entire part of the dalmatian coast is just a bit too popular for its own good with more and more tourists coming every year to dubrovnik split and other honeypot destinations
you can t blame them
the adriatic coast is undeniably beautiful with the forbidding dinaric alps as a dramatic backdrop to the heavily indented coastline and dozens of islands scattered about
but even among the big hitters there are lesser known pockets
croatia s second city is also the jumping off point for ferries to dalmatia s islands so expect crowds of people wheeling their suitcases around the port and old town
at times it s hard to move within the picturesque ruins of the nd century ce diocletian s palace built by the eponymous roman emperor as his retirement home
the nearest beach ba vice just east of the ferry port is equally crowded
instead get some respite among the soothing greenery of marjan a sprawling forested park that covers an entire headland to the west of the port
once you ve wandered along its wooded trails and taken in views of split and the sea from telegrin observation point marjan s highest point at nearly feet head down to je inac beach below the park for a cooling swim
while you re there pop into the me trovi gallery a few minutes walk away to admire the work of croatia s greatest sculptor ivan me trovi who lived from to
his lavish self designed summer villa built in the s to make most of the sea views is an evocative showcase for his art
you can also see his religious art in the th century church within the crikvina complex five minutes walk away
you can easily see olta island from split s port but for some inexplicable reason it s often overlooked in favor of its neighbors hvar and bra
people are missing out on this sleepy laid back place and its sheltered pebbly coves tucked into its southern coast notably the turquoise waters of senjska stra inska and kolji
yachties might have already come across the village of maslinica on the western coast with its well equipped marina and deeply indented e ula bay nearby
towards the eastern end stomorska is equally charming it s also close to some of the island s wineries that produce the indigenous and full bodied dobri i red wine
stop by the convivial ka telanac agroturizam for a wine tasting that includes homemade seafood p t s and tapenades
in between are miles of olive groves that produce award winning oil from indigenous dalmatian varietals
croatia s secret beaches and little venices
the first image of croatian beaches is usually that of bra s long v shaped zlatni rat whose tiny pebbles almost look like white sand
not surprisingly both the beach and its closest town bol have become hotspots
to avoid the crowds try some of the smaller villages along bra s jagged northern coast including pu ica whose quarries produce the creamy bra stone seen all over dalmatia and even the white house in washington dc
you can t miss its handsome stonemason school klesarska kola lording it over the waterfront
over on the west coast the relaxed village of milna wraps itself around a deep harbor while olive groves and vineyards stretch out around the surrounding countryside and offer gentle cycling
from here you can follow the dizzyingly twisting road for about miles along the southern coast to reach a fascinating piece of bra s history the unesco listed blaca hermitage built into the cliffs by th century monks
lured by its hedonistic reputation young tourists come flocking to hvar town in their droves
but there s much more to the island than its status as croatia s official party spot
away from the crowds boat parties and nightclubs it s a different world of lavender fields vineyards pine forests farm restaurants and olive groves
see a mellower side of hvar in stari grad which despite being on a main ferry route is remarkably quiet
explore its venetian marble lanes before setting out for walks on stari grad plain a unesco listed area of olive groves and vineyards created by the greeks in the fourth century bce
carry on eastwards towards some of the smaller fishing villages jelsa and milna both have lovely beaches
vrboska is another one to add to your list its white stone houses flank a canal which flows from the long sinuous harbor
it s a three hour ferry ride from either split or dubrovnik but it s worth the effort to reach lastovo
the entire island is a nature park with more than miles of hiking trails winding through forests and past tiny villages of terracotta roofed stone houses
this really is the place to get away from it all and flop on pebbly beaches after a hike through the woods filling up on grilled seafood in beachfront restaurant
head to the seaside village of zaklopatica where a lofty observation area about an eight minute drive from the center offers far reaching views
park the car and hike another yards or so to reach the peak of so anj for even higher vistas
a few smaller islands are dotted about making lastovo a favorite among divers and snorkelers
nearly as far flung as lastovo is the island of vis which soared in popularity after its starring role in mamma mia here we go again it s a captivating place with venetian style villages including vis town and komi a
the beautiful croatia coastline with fewer tourists
while beach lovers laze on the long coastline of the makarska riviera especially in tu epi ba ka voda brela and makarska itself hikers and mountain bikers head straight to the rocky trails of biokovo nature park
covering about square miles of the dinaric alps biokovo offers tantalizing glimpses of the sea as you make your way higher into the mountains
hardy hikers will want to tackle the foot peak of sveti jure croatia s second highest mountain
thrills of a different sort are on offer on skywalk biokovo a glass bottomed crescent shaped observation deck that hovers over the cliff more than feet above sea level
just north of biokovo and worth a detour is the geographical marvel that is omi
here the cetina river slices through a series of canyons and gorges before flowing into the adriatic splitting the town in two
if you really want to test your nerve fly high across the canyon on one of the eight ziplines run by zipline croatia
in the midst of the rugged dinaric alps that run alongside most of the adriatic coast is the broad flat incredibly fertile landscape of the neretva delta and valley
the same neretva river that flows under mostar s celebrated stone bridge in bosnia empties into the adriatic between the villages of rogotin and blace creating a watery world of pure serenity
orchards waterways wetlands and lakes invite slow exploration by boat on foot or on two wheels as you pass roadside stalls selling the fruit you see growing all around you
park yourself on the wide sandy delta beach to watch kiteboarders skimming across the sands
this long finger of land north of dubrovnik has some of the best vineyards in croatia with rows and rows of vines of red plavac mali and dinga grapes
squeezed into its coastline are dozens of pebbly coves backed by pine woods
until reaching it from the north meant crossing into bosnia whose miles of coastline sits below the neretva delta before giving way once more to croatia s southern dalmatian coast
but in the pelje ac bridge was opened connecting the peninsula to the croatian mainland north of bosnia meaning you can reach the rest of southern dalmatia without having to pass through border checks
from pelje ac you can make a short trip to kor ula the famous island hovers just off the peninsula via the ferry at orebi in the northern part of the peninsula
similarly the lusciously green island of mljet is easily reached from the small port at prapratno further south
before you leave pelje ac you ll want to visit two of the peninsula s most famous sights the oyster beds of mali ston and the hulking stone walls that have been circling the village of ston since the th century
slovenia s julian alps explore this fairy tale landscape
wander along dubrovnik s old port and in seconds you ll be offered a day trip to the elaphiti islands north of the city
while a day is enough to visit all three of the inhabited islands kolo ep lopud and ipan it s more satisfying to pick one and spend a few days reveling in peace once the daytrippers have gone
ipan the largest is the only one to allow cars but there s a seductive feel to it
there s little to do but wander through olive groves which cover much of the island swim in pebbly beaches and devour freshly grilled fish
which makes it pretty much the essence of summertime dalmatian life
anyone who has ever been in dubrovnik s old town during the summer won t be surprised to hear that it s croatia s most visited place
the crowds can be unbearable and many travelers prefer to base themselves in the villages along this last stretch of the country s coastline there s a good bus network to get around
cavtat about miles south of dubrovnik has been steadily growing in popularity as an alternative to the city
or look north of dubrovnik slano a minute drive away is also convenient for visits to the trsteno arboretum when you re not relaxing in the calm waters of the pine fringed bay
