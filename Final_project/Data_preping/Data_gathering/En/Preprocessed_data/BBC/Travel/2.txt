the last place madeline robson expected to meet her future husband was her friend s bachelorette party
i m here for the bride madeline remembers thinking
i shouldn t be having my own love story
this is so strange
but when madeline flew from her home in ontario canada to new orleans to celebrate her friend s upcoming wedding she found herself almost without realizing right in the middle of her own love story
madeline then arrived in new orleans in june as part of a gang of excited women
their main goal partying
at first madeline and her friends barely took in the city s beautiful architecture and skipped its famous music scene in favor of late night clubs
i don t think anybody did any research before
we were just there for a good time and we had a really good time madeline tells cnn travel today
the first few nights the group were out all night on bustling bourbon street dipping in and out of bars drinking shots and dancing
by the time the last night rolled around most of the women were feeling the effects of the long nights
they weren t just hungover many of them seemed to have come down with something
staying in for a low key night became the general consensus
but madeline who d managed to avoid whatever had struck down most of her friends thought staying in seemed like a waste of time they were only in new orleans for a few days surely they should make the most of it
two of her friends felt similarly so while the majority of the group geared up for a movie marathon madeline and her two allies dipped out into the night
the three friends decided to head to frenchmen street to sample the live music scene they d so far avoided
they found themselves in a busy jazz bar and by coincidence recognized the guy on stage they d met him the night before
when he finished performing they got chatting with him
this guy a local said he wanted to show madeline and her friends his favorite hole in the wall bar a couple of doors down
it was about two in the morning by the time madeline and her friends squeezed into the tiny venue
everyone inside was crowding around the stage to watch musicians
as the rest of her group including the guy pushed to the front madeline hung back a bit she didn t feel like fighting her way through
it s definitely easier when you re super tall though she thought to herself absentmindedly as her eyes landed on the guy next to her
he towered over the crowd and madeline assumed must have had a great view of the stage
this guy noticed madeline s eyes on him and gave her a small smile
i don t know who said hi to who but we started talking to each other somehow recalls madeline
and then just ended up talking for hours in this bar all night long
the tall stranger in the bar was sebastian mamet a twentysomething recent college graduate from sweden who by his own admission didn t have much of a life outside of work
sebastian was on a solo trip to the us a trip his company had pretty much forced him to take
he never took any vacation and the days were starting to stack up
he d been initially reluctant but the idea of seeing new orleans was a big draw
sebastian loves music and he d always dreamed of frequenting the city s blues bars
now sebastian found himself ignoring what was happening on stage and focusing on madeline
it just felt like we d known each other for a while sebastian tells cnn travel
sebastian suggested madeline and her friends come with him to another bar
even though it was the early hours of the morning it was warm out so the group sat outside on a terrace drinking and talking
he had a really good energy about him recalls madeline
when a m
rolled around sebastian walked madeline and her friends back to her hotel
do you want to get breakfast with me tomorrow he asked madeline
madeline hesitated
i was feeling guilty she says today
i was there with a bunch of girls
i shouldn t ditch my friends madeline told sebastian declining his invite
well here s my number sebastian said keying the details into her phone
just in case you change your mind
after a few hours of sleep madeline woke up feeling differently
her friends were still sleeping
they had no set plans for their final day
and the women who were awake encouraged madeline to embark on this new orleans adventure
they were all like go get breakfast have fun madeline recalls
so madeline and sebastian found themselves at a quintessential new orleans cafe infused with french influences sitting outside
then there s a huge torrential downpour and the whole cafe flooded recalls sebastian
somehow this unexpected rainfall only added to the experience
madeline and sebastian left the cafe and started wandering around the city
their conversation was just as engaging as the night before
everything was very natural and easy says sebastian
obviously we had a really good connection agrees madeline
but he lived across the ocean
and it was so far
when they hugged goodbye sebastian thought she s such a great person
it s so unlucky that she lives in canada
similar thoughts ran through madeline s mind we re never going to see each other again she thought
this was just a crazy vacation story
but we did she says today
waiting at the airport for her flight madeline s phone pinged with a message from sebastian
have a good flight it read
let me know when you get home
so began a texting back and forth that just literally never stopped from that point as madeline puts it
a couple days later with madeline back in canada and sebastian back in sweden sebastian suggested they could speak on the phone
we ended up facetiming recalls madeline
and then we started facetiming multiple days maybe not every day but many days
less than a month passed before sebastian proposed that they meet again
he had more vacation to take
maybe he could come and visit madeline in ontario in august
madeline agreed
looking back she admits this was really crazy
the fact that i let him come visit me after knowing him for less than hours must have meant that i felt really comfortable or i was really irresponsible she says laughing
i m here for the bride
i shouldn t be having my own love story
this is so strange
madeline robson
but she had no hesitations in saying yes
and sebastian had no hesitations in flying across the world for a second date
sebastian spent a week in canada
he and madeline spent time in her hometown in ontario and also traveled to the region s wine country as well as visiting toronto and niagara falls
sebastian had pictured niagara falls as a secluded nature reserve
madeline tried to warn him the waterfall was a tourist hotspot but he didn t quite believe her
even if sebastian found the touristy side of the falls pretty cheesy he and madeline still had a great time there
it was cool because it s such an iconic canadian landmark says madeline
of course sebastian had met some of madeline s friends in new orleans but she also introduced him to a few more pals over that trip
she didn t tell her family about him though that felt a bit too intense especially when she didn t know what would happen between them
madeline s friends were supportive and liked sebastian but people were kind of like there s no way this is going to go anywhere recalls madeline
towards the end of sebastian s time in canada he and madeline started talking about whether it was going to go anywhere
could they see each other again soon
they decided madeline would visit sebastian in helsingborg in sweden three months later for christmas
they fell in love and lost each other in south america
then a note stuck on a door brought them back together
on the flight from canada to sweden madeline oscillated between excitement and anxiety
we thought he knew each other
but looking back we really didn t know each other that well she says
i was going for three weeks
it was a long time
she was also set to meet sebastian s entire family
again this was exciting but undeniably nerve wracking
it s a strange thing having only spent a short amount of time with somebody to be going to spend three weeks during the holidays with them and their family who you ve never met before madeline says today
sebastian doesn t recall being obviously nervous but his anxieties just manifested themselves differently he spent hours trying to plan the perfect visit for madeline
i was trying to fit way too much into the trip he says today
over the three weeks he took madeline to copenhagen gothenburg and prague
we did too many things says madeline laughing
but it was really fun
madeline particularly enjoyed her first introduction to scandinavian culture
she d never been to a nordic country before but felt instantly at home
it was really cool to see the culture here and life she recalls
over the next year madeline and sebastian alternated visiting one another in sweden and canada
we were very lucky
we got to see each other a lot that year and traveled a lot as well recalls madeline
we traveled together to quite a lot of places
she went on a solo trip to italy
right away she met the love of her life
that year in between jet setting madeline was finishing off her mba
she was set to graduate in december and knew she couldn t make any big life decisions before then
but afterwards she d be more flexible and as the december date approached madeline started considering what she might do next
maybe moving to sweden was on the cards
i had already for quite a long time been like once i finish my mba i m ready for a change
i want to either move somewhere else do something else take a gap year
in february madeline took a year of absence from her ontario communications job and moved to sweden taking advantage of a visa scheme that allows people under to live and work in certain other countries for months
it wasn t a long term decision but it was a big one all the same
madeline imagined she d spend all her time traveling just working here and there but she ended up getting a corporate marketing job almost right away
the job gave her some stability but life in sweden was still a lot of change all at once
it felt like a big step says madeline
i felt like i was leaving something that was really safe and really taking a chance on something that i had no idea how it was going to turn out
at first life in sweden simply felt surreal
but it was exciting says madeline
sebastian and madeline decided they would live together in the swedish city of malm
it was more international than sebastian s previous home in helsingborg
plus sebastian moving meant they were both starting afresh to some extent
madeline also moved with her beloved cat in tow
she worried about her settling in but the cat soon seemed at home
slowly things felt less surreal but for that first year madeline s life in sweden felt somewhere between a dream and an extended vacation
she and sebastian loved living together and getting to experience every day activities together
everything with us together felt new and exciting because we had spent a year and a half never getting to just do normal things like cook dinner together or go grocery shopping says madeline
all those things that so many people take for granted in relationships for us i think were so stimulating because we never got to do them before together everything was just always an adventure
while the two savored their time together in their malm apartment they were also rarely there
at every opportunity madeline and sebastian would travel to different european cities together
madeline loved traveling but this lifestyle had its downsides
i think a product of that is that i never really felt super settled in malm in the first year she says
her flight was canceled
then she ended up on the doorstep of her future wife
in while traveling internationally was out of the question sweden s covid restrictions were more lax than in other countries so madeline and sebastian were still able to travel domestically
it was during this time that madeline fell in love with sweden
all of sudden our weekends were spent outside in the forest or going for hikes along the coastline says madeline
in malm the couple would walk around exploring stopping to sample coffee and pastries on outdoor terraces
all these little things even though we re in this really horrible difficult time started to feel quite special and romantic says madeline
i started to find all these things about the city that i really loved so much
that was definitely during covid when we started talking about seriously staying here
madeline extended her visa and she and sebastian bought an apartment
okay this is real madeline recalls thinking
we re staying
due to canadian border restrictions madeline didn t return to her home country until midway through
by then she was fully settled into swedish life and canada was the vacation destination
i didn t see my family or friends back home for two and a half years she reflects
it really forced me to find a community here and i don t know if i would have found that if it wasn t for the pandemic
so that was i guess a really nice thing to come from a really difficult and hard situation
it was also during the pandemic that madeline started sharing snippets of her life in sweden online via her tiktok and instagram accounts
madeline realized there was an appetite for her short videos about the cultural differences she d noticed since moving to sweden
her videos also provided a slice of escapism for everyone who felt like their life was on hold
the views and comments came flooding in
madeline s still big on social media three years later
i still share a lot of the cultural stuff
but it s really developed into a travel and tourism and life in scandinavia type of account she says
it s been really really fun
she got the last seat on a flight next to a stranger
they ve been married for years
madeline and sebastian got engaged a few years ago and originally planned to marry in
the couple planned a big international wedding but canceled the nuptials when pandemic travel restrictions proved too complicated
when we had to go around and plan it for the second time we kind of realized that we just wanted it to be a very small thing that felt more us says madeline
so the couple got married in summer in a small ceremony attended only by their respective parents and siblings
we went out into the countryside and got married in a little tiny countryside church and had a tiny little ceremony there says madeline
afterwards madeline and sebastian went to a local chocolate factory and enjoyed a swedish fika a coffee and pastry break
later the wedding party traveled to another countryside spot a beautiful bed and breakfast that madeline and sebastian had been to before and loved
we decided oh it s a place that s really special to us
let s just book some rooms there madeline recalls
it was a day both beautiful and low key
it felt very authentic to us says madeline
it s really interesting to think that we were there celebrating somebody else s love and then this is what was born of it
it s really really cool
madeline robson
madeline recently shared some of her wedding photographs on her instagram feed
sebastian only pops up on her social media from time to time but whenever madeline shares glimpses into their life together she ll get inundated with messages from other people in international relationships
is it worth it moving abroad for love they ask
madeline always says yes
i always just say to people have no expectations
if you re going to go for it i really recommend you take the chance because you never know how it s going to end up she says
put everything you have into it and see how it ends up
i have no regrets on how this has gone
and i always like to encourage people to take the chance
today when madeline and sebastian look back on their new orleans meeting sebastian says he s struck by how unusual their meeting was but how normal their life is today
as for madeline she s got over the guilt of meeting her husband to be at her friend s bachelorette party
now it seems meant to be
it s really interesting to think that we were there celebrating somebody else s love and then this is what was born of it she says
it s really really cool
