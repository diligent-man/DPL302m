at the start of the year content creator jess stone was enjoying an epic motorcycle journey around the world with her beloved dog on the back of her bike and her husband greg riding behind them
but within months everything had changed
in march greg was hit by a bus while riding along the pan american highway an accident that destroyed his motorcycle and left him with several broken bones
around two weeks later stone s dog moxie a german shepherd suddenly passed away due to complications during a routine operation five days earlier
she just died stone tells cnn travel
and we were not there
and the guilt that i felt and the grief that i had my world just shattered
stone felt completely lost and had no idea what to do next
greg still had months of recovery left she explains
his bike was totaled
and i didn t have a dog
up until that point they d all been on a multi year adventure goruffly around the world traveling across central america north and south america africa europe and asia in a partnership with global nonprofit girl up a girl centered leadership development initiative
traveling with moxie who she d had for around six and a half years had made the trip all the more special for stone and now her constant companion was gone
consumed by grief she decided to organize a pilgrimage from seattle to san diego to visit people who were doing different activities with their dogs in order to learn about them and the special bond that they shared
it was so extraordinary riding with moxie stone explains
we formed this special bond together
and i knew that there were other people doing different things with their dogs that also had that bond
so i thought wouldn t this be a good way to celebrate moxie and to sort of work through my own grief
a post shared by goruffly around the world goruffly
motorcycle manufacturer triumph provided stone and her husband with new bikes two tiger adventure motorcycles before they set off in july
they visited various activities and animals including a dog show search and rescue dogs dog diving and even puppy yoga sessions during the goruffly pilgrimage which lasted just under a month
once it was over and they started to come to terms with losing moxie stone was keen to get back on the road again
and she wanted a new canine companion along with her for the ride
i m a dog person she explains
i have a dog business
i have a cockpit and i love riding with my dog so i knew that eventually i needed to get a dog
it just had to happen
at first she struggled to find a new pet as every dog that i saw wasn t moxie
she and greg eventually decided on a white swiss shepherd and picked up a nine week old puppy which they named whimsy in los angeles back in june
the couple who manufacture a motorcycle dog carrier along with a range of outdoor dog gear through their company ruffly in guatemala had a carrier made for their new pup and set about training whimsy up for life on the road
stone explains that getting a dog used to wearing goggles is one of the hardest parts of the process
thankfully whimsy was able to get the hang of things relatively quickly and did not fuss
they also did a few practice rides with her to see if she could handle being on a bike for long periods of time
she did so well says stone
it was like she was born for this
following a month or so of training the trio set off from california where they d based themselves while training moxie and began making their way to nevada
now i m riding with whimsy she says
we ve resumed our journey
we re going to continue going south following in the paw prints of moxie and head down to the antarctic
although stone admits that starting over up again with a new pup while grieving for the dog she lost has been tough there s nothing she enjoys more than being on the bike with a canine companion
this couple set off on a motorbike world tour with their beloved dog
then tragedy struck
as our hearts are continuing to heal this is sort of a new opportunity to really love and recapture what we loved about doing this activity she says
as moxie was slightly older when they began traveling with her riding with a puppy is a new experience for stone
she explains that they ve worked out a rhythm in which they ride for four days and then stop to work for three which has been the perfect mix
during their work days whimsy tends to just hang out and sleep before they get back on the bikes and head out again
it s different riding with a puppy than it is with an adult dog she explains
moxie was a year and a half when we started
she was finished with her teething phase and she had a bit more staying power
whimsy is like a fluffy puppy
they ve had to go at a much slower pace with whimsy riding for shorter bursts of time in order to allow her space to be free or have a little nap
it s taught greg and i to slow down ourselves she says
stone learned to ride a motorbike on the side streets of liberia where she and greg were living at the time over years ago and took private off road training lessons before setting off with moxie in march
she had always been anxious about the trickier sections of the route and although it was her husband who was hit by a bus the experience affected her own confidence slightly
when i first got back on my bike after greg s accident i was pretty cautious she says
every time i saw a chicken bus a form of budget public transportation in guatemala as i was riding through guatemala i stayed far away
and it took me a while to get that confidence back
i realized that these things happen
but it s very unlikely to happen to me right now so i was able to get past that
they went on a road trip for their first date
now this couple are driving around the world together
however stone says that the experience of losing moxie as well as her husband s accident has taught them both to live in the moment more
having moxie pass away like that it was so unexpected she recounts
so we know that bad things can happen
and it just makes us try and enjoy every day that we have together now a lot more because we know how fleeting i can be
one of the downsides to traveling with a dog is that they are pretty much limited to dog friendly places and tend to wild camp or stay in airbnbs
wild camping is fantastic says stone before explaining that they ve been crate training whimsy at campsites in preparation for their upcoming flight from panama to colombia
because she can just be free with us and there s nobody around
currently in nevada they are slowly making their way towards mexico before traveling through central and south america where they ll ride to the tip of argentina and then fly to south africa
at that point she ll whimsy be over a year old
and she ll probably be able to do longer distances and longer times adds stone
from south africa they ll travel up to east africa before looping around europe and riding through asia
at this stage they ll ship their motorcycles and return to guatemala by plane with whimsy
stone estimates that they ll be on the road for another three years or so
she s been documenting the journey via instagram as well as a weekly youtube series and both she and greg are thrilled with the support they ve had since introducing whimsy to their followers earlier this month
it s just wonderful how everybody has sort of rallied behind whimsy she says
everybody was just so thrilled that we were able to sort of bring a new joy back into our lives like this and continue the journey with her
stone admits that she s still cautious about riding off road and now understands that having moxie on the back of her bike motivated her to keep going when she felt apprehensive
i still have the anxiety of going down she says
of hurting my bike
you never know what s going to happen which we have obviously seen
i m realizing that maybe moxie made me just a little bit braver
she was the one who was always pushing me to be calm on the off roads
because if i wasn t calm she would fuss
i find whimsy is very similar in that as well
but i feel a lot braver now with these new bikes
i just feel a little bit more competent
while the trip hasn t gone the way she expected stone is hugely grateful to have been able to continue on with the journey and is determined to reach her fundraising target for girl up s global empowerment projects
although things have not turned out as expected she s hugely grateful to have whimsy along with her for the ride and is enjoying watching her experience everything new learning how to ride and going with us on all these crazy adventures
riding with your dog it s sort of become a way of our lives she adds
we get so much pleasure out of doing it
as i watch whimsy i feel like my heart is light
it just makes me happy to share this again
even if it s not with moxie i m glad that i ve got this new co pilot
i feel renewed
