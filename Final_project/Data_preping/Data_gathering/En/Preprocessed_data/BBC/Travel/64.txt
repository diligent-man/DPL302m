renowned for its nourishing simplicity the cuisine of greece is considered among the finest and healthiest in the world
with an emphasis on baked rather than fried food most traditional dishes avoid elaborate sauces preferring the perfume of herb seasonings
nutritionists have long trumpeted the greeks use of unsaturated fats such as olive oil and unprocessed sugars such as honey as well as pulses and vegetables with good reason the mediterranean country lies at the top of longevity lists thanks to its food
indeed one greek island ikaria has been under the microscope in recent years as one in three of its odd residents are over years old
while there may be other lifestyle components involved a typical greek diet appears to be a major factor here
from moussaka to souvlaki here are of the best dishes everyone in greece knows and loves
the worst tongue twister on a list of starters this pungent dip consists of a starchy base of soaked breadcrumbs or potatoes with added lemon juice and olive oil
one of its crucial ingredients is a peculiarly greek delicacy cured fish roe
as the authentic color is a rather off putting gray yellow some cooks and supermarkets add pink coloring to make it appear more appetizing
while dried haricot bean soup fasolada fed hungry greeks during the german occupation in world war ii the dish is now somewhat looked down on
surprisingly though its sister dish a hearty plate of giant baked beans seasoned with cilantro has made it to the typical mezze spread
you might also hear the gigantes further described as plaki which denotes a dish that s oven baked in tomato sauce
from the humblest taverna to the most sophisticated restaurant every menu in greece will offer a choice of choriatiki salad or paesienne known the world over as a greek salad
there may be regional or chef specific variations on this classic but the foundations are the same sliced tomatoes onions and cucumber olives feta cheese plus a dressing of olive oil and oregano
order a bush sized one at dinner time for a complete healthy meal
this nutritious soup is renowned for its curative properties and looks deceptively easy to make
the cooking process actually involves slowly boiling a whole chicken in a pot with vegetables and bonnet rice and then picking the meat off discarding the skin and bones
but the fun really begins with the egg and lemon sauce avgolemono
at this point you break a couple of yolks into a bowl and slowly pour some of the broth while whisking
squeeze in some lemon juice and stir the bowl s liquid carefully back into the pot it won t curdle if just simmering
the result is a rich silky smooth soup that marries fat carbs and protein with vitamin c
pies or pitta are a big deal in greece
in fact every bakery in athens sells an assortment both sweet and savory for those pangs of hunger while on the trot
there s tyropita cheese pie spanakopita spinach pie zambonopita ham pie kotopita chicken pie chortopita pie with mountain greens and combinations thereof
each is encased in puff pastry with two exceptions tyropita kourou made with flaky short crust and from the sporades islands strifti a fried spiral shaped filo cheese pie
hailed as a superfood by dieticians because of its high protein and negligible fat content the unpretentious fava a puree of yellow dried split beans lies not a million tastebuds away from the english pease pudding
in greece it s more closely associated with the island of santorini where it s prepared with onions olive oil and lemon juice
these bite sized meatballs are a children s perennial party favorite
keftedes are prepared by mixing pork veal or lamb mince and finely grated onion with dampened stale bread scented with fresh mint and bound with egg yolk
the mixture is left in the fridge to cool and firm up before being rolled into balls dusted with flour and fried in olive oil
the world s best foods
when greeks from turkey s aegean coast returned to the country after the greco turkish war they brought many of their own recipes with them
the ever popular soutzoukakia is one of the most noted
indeed you may often see the extra description smyrneika which is from smyrna in taverna menus
like keftedes they re meatballs
however soutzoukakia are baked in a cumin scented sauce rather than floured and fried
they re almost always served with pilau rice a reminder of their oriental provenance
by far the best known greek dish internationally typifying the country s cuisine moussaka is also one of the most elaborate
here minced meat slices of potatoes and eggplant are separately fried before being layered in a baking pan and topped with a b chamel sauce
next comes a long slow cooking in the oven
one of moussaka s plus points which makes up for its long preparation is that it tastes as good lukewarm or reheated perhaps a reason for its popularity
moschari kokkinisto or veal casserole in tomato sauce is the most common stew across greece
veal rather than beef has traditionally been the country s meat of choice
this is because of the lack of space for raising large animals in the confines of a walled town or castle
pep up the stew with pickling onions rosemary sprigs plus red wine and you end up with stifado
brought to greece by the venetians it s an unusually calorific course in a country of light meals
the only types of pasta that have been fully integrated in greek cuisine are spaghetti long macaroni bucatini and orzo risoni
orzo is cooked together with meat in oven dishes while spaghetti is almost exclusively eaten as a bolognese flavor enhanced by cinnamon and all spice
pastitsio is a greek invention however
here a base of boiled long macaroni with cooked minced meat is topped by a cheese sauce and given a quick final bake in the oven
it may look like moussaka but the air trapped along the macaroni renders it a fluffier lighter meal
all vegetable dishes of which there are plenty in greek cuisine come under the ladera heading usually as stews green beans ladies fingers eggplants zucchini artichokes the lot
exemplary vegan pleasers ladera used to be the staple food during lent or on the day before major religious festivals when the orthodox faithful are supposed to abstain from meat
you can pick up these rings of baked bread dough covered in sesame seeds from street vendor stands in every greek city
originating from thessaloniki s jewish community it s essentially a southern version of the central european pretzel
while koulouria has served as the comfort food of greek school children throughout the ages they face competition from a multitude of manufactured munchies today
thessaloniki s other great culinary contribution to greek cuisine bougatsa consists of filo pastry wrapped around a sweet semolina based custard
usually baked as a large pie and then freshly cut in smaller pieces it s served with icing sugar and cinnamon powder zen perfect alongside a cup of coffee
greek sausages aren t mass produced
in fact each butcher s shop manufactures its own following the regional style
spetzofai a local recipe from the pelion peninsula in thessaly calls for a wintry stew of mountain sausage and sliced green peppers
but unlike most sausages in greece these are chorizo style spicy with the peppers adding an extra kick
which country has the best food
galeos the school shark is a common fish in greek waters
with a similar taste to cod it s traditionally served on march the feast of the annunciation
although the date always falls during the fast of lent the annunciation is a joyous occasion so the orthodox church allows the consumption of fish
this custom continues today and you ll notice an odor in the air if you happen to be in the country on that day
the fish fillets are boldly accompanied by skordalia a strong smelling aioli made with olive oil and lots of crushed garlic on a base of potato bran or breadcrumbs
often confused with gyros a type of kebab souvlaki is made up of skewered grilled pieces of meat typically chicken lamb or pork and can be found throughout the balkans and the middle east
the fast food of previous generations and the sustenance of travelers they re sold as skewers straight from the grill or wrapped in pitta bread with salad and a sauce usually tzatziki
another greek appetizer classic tzatziki is a refreshing mixture of cool yoghurt crunchy cucumber garlic olive oil and fresh aromatic mint
for traditionalists this is the only proper accompaniment to souvlaki and they have a compelling case
the grilled meat cuts can be heavy on the stomach and the ingredients in tzatziki aid digestion
this dish of slowly cooked roast lamb with herbs wrapped in baking parchment paper stems from an era when the village bakery was also in charge of the communal oven
households would bring in their own parceled joint on sunday mornings for baking and pick it up at lunch time
although the advent of fitted kitchens has made this scenario obsolete the recipe is still popular
the parchment paper allows the meat to be steamed in its own juices perfumed by the added herbs
for greeks the sight of melomakarona egg shaped honey soaked cookies specked by chopped walnuts screams christmas as loudly as a decorated tree
indeed it s considered bad luck if a household doesn t bake a few dozen during the weeks leading to the nativity
visit any friends in greece during this period and you ll be offered the house melomakarona
try one praise the cook for their crumbliness and you ll for sure be invited next year as well
breakfast around the world how different places start the day
the thick skin of beef tomatoes zucchini and bell peppers makes them easy to hollow out so greeks stuff them and bake them in the oven
this stuffing is normally a mixture of cooked rice onions aromatic herbs and the excised vegetable flesh itself
they re delicious served hot or cold a bonus in a warm weather country where leftover food must go straight to the fridge
stuffed vine leaves are a common sight from syria to sarajevo indeed the word dolma is turkish meaning stuffed but it s mostly greek restaurants that have introduced them to the rest of the world
unlike gemista though the usual filling here is minced meat and they re served hot with avgolemono sauce
dolmadakia can occasionally be served cold as yalantzi a turkish word for a liar and a conman when filled with rice instead
this is the only option during meat abstaining lent
you can smell the caramel style aroma of these so called greek donuts fried dough balls richly bathed in honey and seasoned with cinnamon powder whenever you pass any large bakery
connoisseurs eat them hot from the pan so settle for nothing less and buy from places where they are cooked on the spot
the vast quantity of fruit produced in greece proved overwhelming in olden times when trade was slow or nonexistent
as a result spoon sweets such as western european jams became the greek way of preserving fruit
this is one of the occasions when pure sugar rather than honey is used in traditional greek recipes
it s added in such large quantities that most people can only bear a gloopy spoonful
try them with yoghurt to temper the sugar rush
