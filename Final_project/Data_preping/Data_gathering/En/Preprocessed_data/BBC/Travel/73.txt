alison sinclair s trip to turks and caicos was supposed to be one of the best times of her life
but while on an island getaway with her best friend she skipped beach time and swimming in favor of the bar getting so drunk every day that she alienated her friend and they stopped speaking
now years of sobriety later sinclair still barely remembers what turks and caicos looked like
as she started on a journey of rebuilding her life and reconciling with her friend she made a promise to herself this time she d travel the world with complete use of her faculties
while sinclair s decision to give up drinking was very personal she s just one of the many travelers who have been asking major tourism companies to make sober friendly itineraries
and their requests have been heard
many major travel brands from hyatt hotels to norwegian cruise line are not only offering alcohol free experiences but marketing them
although there have always been travelers who eschew alcohol for a variety of reasons such as religious observance or health the growing sober curious movement has extended into tourism often as part of a bigger trend toward wellness
according to the world health organization three million deaths every year are attributable to alcohol
among people aged that number peaks with of deaths globally being in some way caused by alcohol
want to drink less or stay sober here s how to deal with the social pressure
we love lucid a uk based sober travel company shows a potential model for a new generation of travelers who want to be sober on the road but don t belong to any particular recovery program
in fact says founder lauren burnison from the very beginning i chose not to use words on my website and in my marketing such as addiction and recovery because there s a lot of people that are in the middle of this continuum
many of the participants on we love lucid trips don t identify as alcoholics or say they are in recovery and they ve chosen not to drink for a variety of reasons
like sinclair burnison found that when she quit drinking she suddenly had a lot more disposable income and a whole world to spend it in
while visiting the spanish town of ronda which is about miles east of malaga she hit on an idea if she found sober travel so fun and illuminating wouldn t other people like it too
now we love lucid organizes group trips to lesser touristed destinations like ronda where burnison ended up moving in
days are filled with sightseeing kayaking and tapas making classes
the whole thing behind the going away on an alcohol free trip with a bunch of other people that don t drink it s about the connection
it s about connecting to other people that have had a similar life experience to you burnison says
travelers bonded really quickly and really deeply because there s that shared vulnerability
sober curious is a term coined by british writer ruby warrington in her book of the same name
warrington s book is widely credited with giving voice to a new kind of sober ish person who doesn t belong to a specific faith or credo and can simply be drinking less rather than quitting completely
but burnison wants to draw a line between sober curious and sober
socializing without alcohol can be challenging for people who are new to recovery and there aren t opportunities to be tempted by seeing other people imbibe
even alcohol mega brands are getting in on the action
some of the world s largest beer companies like asahi and imbev are now marketing their own low or zero alcohol beverages
jen batchelor ceo of the nonalcoholic beverage brand kin euphorics told cnn in that sober curiosity is a real thing for a long time she says she thought the only two options at night were to go out drinking or to stay home and do nothing
now sober bars across the us are catering to a new audience while still offering tasty colorful drinks and opportunities to socialize
and travel companies have stepped in to support those same consumers when they want to leave the safe confines of their communities
in some cases the creation of a sober travel product wasn t because of feedback from customers it was because of feedback from staff
deon de villiers who runs the bespoke travel company safari guru says that one of his staff members checked in to a wellness center to cope with their drinking which was exacerbated by covid
this employee then got de villers to think about how a sober person might feel challenged while on safari
when you go on a safari every safari lodge has got a bar and the bar is in your face he says
so what we try and do is we try and remove that element out of the camp and rather put other colorful drinks and things and educate the staff on providing beautiful cocktails that are not alcoholic
because safari guru already heavily customizes its trips de villers says it was easy to begin offering sober safaris
for him the most important part was keeping all the traditional elements of safaris game drives tented camps and the like in place while swapping out some of the boozy traditions
the client still wants to watch the sunset and they still want the acacia tree he says
but now sundowners are replaced by pretty instagram worthy mocktails
he agrees with burnison the founder of we love lucid that simply not serving alcohol is only part of the equation
that s why we like the group approach
so you re with like minded individuals
a lot of these people a lot of them need support as well and that s what we found
the individuals that we actively engage with they want to interact with other people that are sober themselves
and to come full circle these sober safari trips are led by the sober employee who suggested the program in the first place
the challenge of becoming and staying sober on reality tv
nonprofit alcohol change uk came up with the dry january campaign in
the concept was simple after a decadent december full of holiday feasts people could spend the next month abstaining from alcohol as a way to detox and get healthy again in the new year
according to data from cga a company that researches food and drink trends of americans over the legal drinking age opted to participate in dry january
and dry january offers brands and consumers alike the chance to try out a no drinking lifestyle without fully committing
the hotel chain hyatt first experimented with a mocktail menu for dry january at a few of its properties in the united states
when it proved successful hyatt deepened their commitment creating the zero proof zero judgment program and rolling it out across the country
while we received requests for non alcoholic drinks long before sober travel really took off through listening to our guests members and colleagues we knew there was a real demand for options that allow for a more mindful relationship with alcohol miranda breedlove hyatt s national director of bars and lifestyle operations tells cnn travel
as the name says we want to ensure there s no judgment a guest may not be drinking alcohol for many reasons
sober travel may be a big trend in the tourism industry right now
but for alison sinclair it s simply her life
since getting clean she has now traveled to countries as far flung as burundi papua new guinea and yemen
and she has been to alcoholics anonymous meetings in nearly all of them
