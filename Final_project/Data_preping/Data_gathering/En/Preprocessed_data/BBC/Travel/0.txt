first things first despite some truly terrifying tales of survival you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon
but sharks do occasionally attack humans and they certainly make news when they do
rockaway beach park in queens new york was closed to swimming and surfing on august one day after a woman was hospitalized after suffering an apparent shark bite
a teenager was bitten by a shark on the foot in early july as he was surfing off the coast of new york s fire island
a russian citizen was killed by a shark in the red sea in egypt on june
a shark attacked a woman from connecticut while she was snorkeling at a resort in turks and caicos on may
while these kinds of encounters understandably cause would be ocean swimmers to worry there s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation
the chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low despite the headlines
the florida museum of natural history s international shark attack file found only confirmed unprovoked shark bites on people and confirmed provoked bites in worldwide
think about it a minute the world population is more than billion people
many of those live near or vacation at the coast
and only bites were logged
your chances of drowning are much much higher
in the united states led the way in unprovoked attacks at florida had the highest state total at
that said you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack according to shark experts interviewed by cnn travel
know your environment
sharks are salt water creatures
the ocean is their home we are the visitors
if you re going to the ocean you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is said neil hammerschlag director of the shark research and conservation program at the university of miami rosenstiel school
sharks grab our attention but there are far more dangerous things
fortunately humans aren t on the menu and also fortunately sharks tend to avoid people
still there are places you re more likely to encounter a shark
river mouths are not the best place to swim
you should avoid estuaries said richard peirce an author shark expert and former chair of the uk based shark trust and shark conservation society
their often murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks
an awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river people washing their clothes people washing themselves said peirce
hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out
avoid areas with fishing
before you jump in the sea have a look around the horizon what do you see if you see fishing boats peirce says forget it
whether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational material will often be being discarded and unwanted dead fish fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks he said
before you go in watch for unusual fish activity such as a whole bunch of small and medium sized fish jumping out of the water hammerschlag said
that s a possible sign a shark might be nearby
he also advised to not swim within roughly yards of where someone is fishing from shore
avoid dusk and dawn
swimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely but it s also the time when a shark attack is most likely
a lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity peirce says due to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark
hang with lifeguards
chris lowe professor in marine biology and director of the shark lab at california state university long beach advises to do your homework before you go into unfamiliar waters
bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places
if you have any questions ask a local lifeguard
he said they are a great resource
i always recommend people go to guarded beaches
it s a lot safer he said
don t wear shiny objects in the water
be careful with jewelry anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish lowe said
in murky water a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal
and you don t want your hand or foot to get confused with that
follow your instincts
probably the most important thing is to follow your gut hammerschlag said
if you feel wary about getting in the water just don t go in the water
a lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn t listen to it he said
don t panic
so you re being circled by a shark
the worst thing you can do right now is panic
don t start splashing around you re just going to excite incite and encourage the shark s interest said peirce
humans apes dogs and cats all have paws and hands
if we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it we feel it we put it to our nose
a shark has got no paws or hands so if it wants to explore something the only capability it s got to do that is to put it in its mouth said peirce
that s why we often get exploratory bites which don t result in death and sometimes don t even result in serious injury
if you go swimming and splashing away you re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite
maintain eye contact
as the shark swims around you keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact
sharks are ambush predators peirce explained
if you re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you it s not going to be half as comfortable as if it s able to sneak up from behind
hammerschlag concurred saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you re following it
then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore
if you re surfing track the shark with your board lowe said
let the shark know it s being watched
marine biologists and shark divers adriana fragola and kayleigh grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks
in a viral tiktok video see top of story the shark is seen as fragola splashes away capturing its attention
she turns around faces the approaching shark remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand
you re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you fragola says in the video
stay big or get small
this is where it gets complicated
if a shark is clearly in attack mode you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water according to peirce
the bigger you are in the water the more respect you ll get he said
but if the shark seems to simply be passing through peirce s advice is to roll up into a ball
if a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source that can be one reason it attacks you he explained
if i didn t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor and if it wasn t showing massive interest in me i would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me
don t play dead
this isn t a bear it s a shark
if you find yourself in an aggressive encounter give it hell punch kick and poke at sensitive spots but be careful where you aim
there s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose
that s ok but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth said peirce
this is a moving object in the water and you re not staying still either so what you don t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it
a good shot to the gills can also do the job the gills are very sensitive giving a shark a whack in the gills isn t a bad idea
are you carrying anything with you if so turn it into a weapon
if you re a diver with an underwater camera use it if you re a snorkeler rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark peirce says
how to survive an alligator attack or better yet avoid one entirely
i ve had a lot of sharks come at me and it s been enough to use a shark billy a small metal rod between two and three feet long and i ve just given them a little nudge on their nose
it s a good idea to swim with other people lowe said
not only does that decrease the chances of an attack he said but you ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten
cut off the angles
if you re a diver and you run into trouble try to get into a position where the shark can t get behind you says peirce
keep your back to something like a coral reef
then you ve only got one direction to look
you re protected from behind for example and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is
slowly back away
displace the least amount of water possible
try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore
you must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water
again you ve got to be careful large sharks can attack in very shallow depths
doing the above may help to a degree but peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim
if a white shark is in full attack mode there s not much you re going to be able to do at that point he says
