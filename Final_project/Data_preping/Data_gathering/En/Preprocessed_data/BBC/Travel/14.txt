first it was the cruise that never ends
now passengers are concerned that it might be the cruise that never begins
life at sea cruises is due to launch its three year round the world cruise next month setting sail from istanbul on november
but with just weeks to go the company has not yet secured a ship for the voyage
while life at sea insists that the cruise will be going ahead on schedule some future residents are concerned their plans are not yet ship shape
one who has already paid over to the company told cnn that the situation is a joke
they fear the cruise may end up canceled and wish to remain anonymous because i ve not wanted to tell anyone i m embarrassed i m ashamed that i fell for it
i should have listened to my gut
miray cruises which owns life at sea had been due to complete the sale on its ship for the three year cruise slated to be called the mv lara at the end of september
but one week on the boat is still not theirs
a spokesperson for miray told cnn that the sale was not finalized while the team was in germany to pick up the ship so the miray crew left the boat
it would have been impractical for the seller to continue accommodating the crew onboard without the finalized transaction so the team voluntarily disembarked while they sorted out the details
the lasc team will be flying back early next week the spokesperson said
although miray had never confirmed the name of the ship it was planning to buy it s widely believed to be the aidaaura belonging to aida cruises a german centric subsidiary of carnival
the company was due to say goodbye to the ship in september after years and more than voyages according to aida s website
the ship which was godmothered by supermodel heidi klum for aida has four restaurants two lounges five bars and clubs and two pools
aida cruises did not respond to requests for comment on whether the sale had gone through
meet the people who want to spend the rest of their lives on cruise ships
the path to freedom on the high seas has not gone smoothly for life at sea cruises
the brand was launched in march when its offer of a three year cruise around the world visiting countries made headlines for its relative affordability
introductory prices started at around per person per year but included all accommodation food and crucially for americans medical expenses
totted up against rent and rising prices in a global cost of living crisis it seemed an attractive proposition
three months later the project hit the skids when roughly half the launch team quit to work on their own round the world cruise project
the schism is now at the heart of a lawsuit brought by miray
while some putative passengers canceled because of the chaos others stayed on with miray promising that the cruise would go ahead as scheduled and that it would be buying a bigger ship for it
in september the company announced it would extend the cruise indefinitely allowing passengers to stay onboard for life if they so wished
three year cruise becomes the cruise that never ends
kendra holmes ceo of miray told cnn by email categorically that the sailing is not delayed despite the ship sale not having been completed
in july holmes had said that life at sea would take possession of the new ship in late september where it would undergo work in dry dock for two weeks with the rest of the works being completed en route to istanbul
now with the sale pushed back she says that we expect to get the transfer of ownership of the ship next week
to make the original sail date they will focus on refurbishing cabins that have already been booked she said
but it looks like residents may have to deal with noise onboard as she added that the remaining cabins will be refurbished afterward
about half the cabins have been sold she said adding as a team with decades of experience with the intricacies of the cruising world we have always had contingency time built into any schedule
closings take time and sometimes there are delayed
this situation is not uncommon especially when there are many moving parts and multiple parties involved
with less than a month to go some passengers are getting anxious at the lack of communications from the company
cnn has spoken to several residents as passengers will be known who are concerned at how the cruise is progressing
all wished to remain anonymous
all say that the company has not responded to queries for a month and has even ignored requests to cancel trips
holmes told cnn that we shared an update with our residents a few days ago and have been posting and interacting online regularly but some residents disagree
they said that since september when the team issued a spa menu nothing was heard until october when holmes addressed residents concerns that the ship sale hadn t gone through confirming that the closing has been delayed
we do not have an estimated time frame yet on when it will occur but we do have extra time built into our schedule to ensure an on time launch they say there has been no official communication since then
i know they re really busy but they should have some courtesy and at least answer questions said one resident
we don t know anything about shore excursions we don t know anything about luggage
they don t even have the form that we re supposed to fill out so they can get prepared with medical prescriptions for everybody
there s nothing
she signed up to live on a cruise ship for three years
here s why
with the clock ticking not everyone is convinced that the ship will depart istanbul on november
i m in limbo i have no idea what s happening from one day to the next said one
if it goes ahead it ll be an amazing opportunity that ll never happen again at the price we paid
i wasn t willing to lose that opportunity
they ve never been great at communications but i ve had a feeling for the past month that things were happening in the background that we weren t aware of
running cruise ships is their business so i expect them to know what they re doing
to walk into what should have been the closing on a ship and not be prepared they ve bent over backwards but we have no idea what s going on financially
the price of the cruise is half what other world cruises charge
it s a mess
some of the residents cnn have spoken with say they will be homeless if the cruise doesn t go ahead
people sold their houses cars and possessions in order to commit
one passenger has arranged to sell their business at the end of the month
i m completely homeless and jobless come november they said
i have to wait till the th of october when miray has suggested they will complete the sale but in my head i m working up a plan b and getting a backup place where i might be able to stay for a short period
some passengers took advantage of a deal to save money by paying upfront for the cruise
many have plowed tens of thousands of dollars into the project already
i shouldn t have let my passion for this trip cloud my normally good judgment said one passenger
in a message to residents seen by cnn miray has said that anyone wanting to cancel at this stage will be refunded only of what they ve put into the scheme
although holmes didn t confirm a specific date for the ship to change hands with cnn residents say that they have heard informally that miray will take possession on october
and although holmes insists they will make the november launch the passengers cnn has spoken with are doubtful
i fully expect the cruise to be delayed even if they take possession on that date said one
it was supposed to go into dry dock and get renovated
i don t think it would be good for them to skip that and show up with a nasty year old carnival cruise ship that we re supposed to live in for three years
one passenger cnn spoke to has chosen to embark at a later point and says it s because they expected confusion at the start
i wanted to give them a few weeks to work out the bugs before they picked me up i m glad i won t have to put up with them possibly renovating during the transatlantic sailing they said
holmes told cnn people aren t concerned
we don t feel that anyone is unnerved
we ve been responsive to all resident questions and have been getting a lot of positive messages from them
all the residents hope that despite their fears the cruise does go ahead
people have left their homes sent their possessions to the warehouse some booked vacations on the way to istanbul and are already in transit said one
if it happens on november i ll be shocked
i just really really hope they don t cancel
