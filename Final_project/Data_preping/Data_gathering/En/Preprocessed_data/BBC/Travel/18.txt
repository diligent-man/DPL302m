the rising cost of living in america has been hitting households hard in recent years with many struggling to make ends meet
one us family has become so frustrated by the situation that they ve decided to pack up their lives and move to a town in the deep south of italy
chris and jennifer tidroski from prescott arizona have joined the growing number of us citizens who ve bought a neglected home in an underpopulated italian village for a song in search of a slower paced life
in the tidroskis purchased a house in the historical district of the village of latronico in southern italian region basilicata for euros around and have since spent an extra euros on renovating it
our goal is to relocate in the next year or so as soon as the house is ready and we get our visa together with our seven year old daughter lidia
we want a brighter future chris tidroski a year old former osteopath who now teaches bowling tells cnn
the couple say that the cost of living in the us has become too high especially when it comes to healthcare
her family inherited a year old italian castle
here s what it s like living there
having both worked in the sector they say they ve seen costs spiral over the past decade and aren t hopeful that things will improve
chris explains that the political polarization in the us has been a contributing factor in their decision to relocate to italy
we don t like the political landscape in the states it s laughingly ridiculous he says
there s a shift too far in both directions no middle ground anymore
we can t relate
being able to reconnect with his italian heritage was also a trigger for change for chris whose great grandfather migrated to the us at the end of the s from a village near latronico
the tidroskis decided to travel to latronico to take a look at the available empty dwellings in after reading about its housing scheme local authorities launched an online platform your house in latronico to help owners meet buyers in order to lure expats to the picturesque hilltop town
we picked latronico because of the advertisement
it had never occurred to us to buy a house overseas but i loved the idea of the program and the prices were surprisingly low says jennifer who is also an osteopath
after viewing some properties in the town they opted for a two bedroom home measuring square meters which came with a patch of land and can be accessed by car via the old district
the sale process had no unfortunate surprises and went very smoothly says chris who flew to italy to sign the paperwork later that year
this american family opened a restaurant in italy
since purchasing their italian home the couple have upgraded the floors and given the kitchen dining room bathrooms and bedrooms a facelift
they ve also installed new roof tiles a heater air conditioning updated the plumbing and repainted the exterior walls shiny yellow
the tidroskis explain that the renovation work has taken longer than they expected mainly due to a shortage of builders in italy
over the past three years italian households have been receiving government approved tax credits of up to for green upgrades triggering a renovation frenzy across the country
we were told we just had to wait in the queue which was a bit frustrating says chris
although the costs were slightly more than they estimated the tidroskis say they couldn t have afforded a similar house in the us
while the couple have decided not to try to get a license practice to work as osteopaths as it s a very hard pass to get into the italian board of physicians jennifer plans to set up a practice of alternative medicine for which no license is required
she ll be the first practitioner of non western energy medicine in latronico for which no italian board exam is required
latronico currently lacks any kind of osteopath according to deputy mayor vincenzo castellano so jennifer s practice will likely be well received by elderly locals
they bought a cheap home in italy
then they bought another
i have not been able to spend as much time in latronico as i would like but i m in love with the architecture and small town feel says jennifer
watching people walking to the bakery and the butcher stopping for espresso and talking to each other in the street is not something i see in my us community
the tidroskis recently sold their home in arizona and are temporarily living in a condo while they prepare to move to latronico
but the process has been far from simple
they say the main obstacle they ve faced aside from the language barrier was the visa process
they ve been experiencing difficulties getting an elective residency visa erv a long stay permit designed for non eu citizens which requires those applying as a couple to have a passive income of euros around annually
this erv is so difficult to obtain as we don t meet income targets we looked into other options but none are feasible says chris
for instance if you donate some million euros to italy s artistic heritage it would make the cut
he s recently embarked on a search to prove his basilicata origins with the help of castellano in order to apply for italian citizenship by descent
chris has been collecting key documents on his ancestors following a paper trail to find the birth certificates of his great great grandfather from regional register offices in order to tie these to him through the birth certificate of his mother
while his mother was italian chris father was polish lithuanian
in the past there were no register offices in deep italy so older birth certificates are usually found in parishes monasteries and convents
luckily castellano knows several places where i can get access to all this information he says
the more my ancestry line dates back higher are the chances of claiming my roots
this family is moving to italy because they ve had enough of the us
he admits that he wishes he d done more research into this process of obtaining residency in italy earlier on
while americans with homes in italy who don t meet the visa requirements tend to go back and forth to the us to meet the day stay rule the family hopes to live in latronico permanently
my advice to people who d like to relocate to italy is to make sure you have worked out how getting citizenship and visa work that s what may hold you up says chris
before buying the house have a plan look into various options to avoid head splitting issues
he warns potential international buyers to make sure that they know exactly where they stand before embarking on a property hunt in italy
buying a house does not grant you the right to residency he says
without a visa you can t stay in italy more than out of days period
despite the setbacks they ve faced the couple say they ve been completely won over by latronico and are looking forward to officially starting their lives in the town however long that may take
we love the pace of living here the afternoon siesta the fresher healthy veggies and fruits and the delicious butcher shop close to our house says chris
