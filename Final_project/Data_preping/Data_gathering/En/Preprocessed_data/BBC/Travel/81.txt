two simple words can spark mouth watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in texans breakfast tacos
in the lone star state who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of haba ero hot debate
a highly contested eater article in helped start a full on breakfast taco war between austin and san antonio
while that particular battle eventually settled down flare ups continue
but to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history we must go beyond texas and first look at another place mexico
the breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods pizza for instance whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate
there s one thing we know for darn sure today breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the rio grande river
in her cnn searching for mexico series actor eva longoria traveled to monterrey in the state of nuevo le n
the breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food but it s been been hitting the spot for the workers of monterrey for nearly a century
eva longoria in searching for mexico
there she enjoyed a breakfast taco with mexican food bloggers gerardo alvarado and ernesto esquivel at tacos do a mary la gritona which has been serving central monterrey for nearly years
the breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food but it s been been hitting the spot for the workers of monterrey for nearly a century narrates longoria
cnn travel caught up with esquivel born and raised in the border state of sonora and resident of monterrey for more than years to find out more
when i arrived in monterrey i discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning
you can have a taco of eggs
you can have a taco of meat
you can have a taco of potatoes
esquivel describes breakfast tacos as a really fast food but not a junkie food
esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern mexico but monterrey and the state of nuevo le n are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings
some of the city s favorites are the machacado dried beef with eggs the barbacoa slow cooked meat often in a pit and the deshebrada shredded beef
in other words you re in meat country
esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early s and perhaps even earlier in monterrey
compa ia fundidora a former iron and steel foundry that dates to but is now a recreational and educational park helped the breakfast taco get its start in monterrey
employees came to work really early and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco
and from there the tacos spread into southern texas esquivel said which is reflected in the cuisine of today
i think the flavors here in monterrey mostly in the north are similar to some flavors in texas
along with do a mary s he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you re in monterrey tacos rafa ahogados tacos piedra and tony s tacos
the river may mark a political line between two nations but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture
and texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco
you can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them
no texas city can claim the breakfast taco says jos ralat the taco editor of texas monthly magazine
he places the ultimate credit south of the rio grande
it comes from mexico where exactly it s not really known
geographically the most likely source is northern mexico
there is no literature that i have seen that can point to any particular city in northern mexico
as for today they re popular in the mexican states of tamaulipas nuevo le n and coahuila which all border texas he said
eddie vega who grew up in mcallen across from the mexican city of reynosa in tamaulipas state is known as taco poet of texas he points out that historically what s now south texas was once part of mexico
best mexican food dishes to try
before the border was further north
all this region was eating a combination of indigenous and spanish food together
vega said that growing up breakfast tacos weren t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of the new york times and other coastal media
when you get to south texas and i m from the valley we had breakfast tacos but they were in my house
my mom would make them
it s not something we d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody s eating out
or not eating out in the morning especially
ralat and vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south texas and then san antonio long before austin got in on the action
so how did austin become so synonymous with them
austin has a great branding mentality they have a knack for pr
every year austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out south by southwest ralat said
they try some options and then in their minds they think it s an austin thing
my job is to question the stuff and let history speak for itself
the capital of texas is finally earning its grand reputation for great tacos
ralat said san antonio has a bit of an inferiority complex that they re often overlooked to the benefit of austin when san antonio is older has more culture it s more diverse and the food is better
to be clear they re both tex mex towns and breakfast tacos are tex mex
but they re also border food
when the eater article came out championing austin as home of the breakfast taco san antonians lost their minds
i don t know that one city san antonio corpus christi mcallen brownsville or laredo can claim it
eddie vega on the breakfast taco
vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor
i don t know that one city san antonio corpus christi mcallen brownsville or laredo can claim it
you have differences with them because of ingredients
jessica elizarraras a rio grande valley native and the executive producer for mysa com said many people have put the origins dispute behind them
i think at this point we ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of elizarraras said in an email interview with cnn travel
is there occasional ribbing absolutely are there great tacos across the state percent
the mexican diaspora is far reaching and so are their tacos
she cites a article by gustavo arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows austin is not the start of the breakfast taco
she also points out the regional differences within texas
a flour tortilla in san antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its rio grande valley coast counterparts
con huevos tacos in san antonio is the best of both worlds a thin but sturdy tortilla filled with fun flavorful combinations
ralat said he s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast
he was also recently in nashville and saw them offered there
i hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them austin style
i want the food to be high quality
i don t want it to be spin
breakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come which makes them that much more magical
jessica elizarraras
elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them with or without huevos eggs
breakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come which makes them that much more magical she said
bean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn t have eggs
chicharron en salsa verde or rojo is another example of a tasty taco that doesn t require eggs
barbacoa made using a whole cow head and more generally beef cheeks is a classic breakfast taco in san antonio often paired with big red soda for a sunday morning treat
in the end why does the origin of a type of food even matter
part of the issue is erasure
just like with anything else in our mexican american culture to feel left out of a conversation when you know you ve part of that conversation for a long time vega said
and back south of the rio grande they are a source of unity esquivel said
eva longoria mexican food is so much more than tacos and tequila
i think the breakfast tacos here in monterrey and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone
they re popular with the poor the middle class and the rich he said
the place can be ugly
the place can be like in the streets
but you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos
for ralat breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning
i think history especially food history is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture
it s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of mexican culture and to break bread with someone is a sacred act
so let s take it literally and say that you share tacos with someone else
that s so nice
and it s just so joyful
