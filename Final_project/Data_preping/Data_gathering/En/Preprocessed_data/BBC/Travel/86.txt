paul templer was living his best life
he was and conducting tours in his native zimbabwe with a focus on photographic safaris
he had been away for a few years including a stint in the british army
but he had returned to africa s bush country and fell back in love with it
the wildlife the flora the fauna the great outdoors the space just everything about it
i was at home
templer said zimbabwe s guide certification program was rigorous and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed
he reveled in showing tourists the area s majestic wildlife including the water loving very territorial hippos
it was idyllic he told cnn travel
life was really really good until one day i had a really bad day at the office
march
a saturday
templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the zambezi river had malaria
he agreed to take his pal s place
i loved that stretch of the river
it was an area i know like the back of my hand
the expedition consisted of six safari clients four air france crewmembers and a couple from germany three apprentice guides plus templer
they had three canoes clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back
then one apprentice guide was in a one person safety kayak
and down the famed zambezi they went
things were going the way they were supposed to go
everyone was having a pretty good time
eventually they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos
that s not unexpected on the zambezi africa s fourth longest river
they weren t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance
but we were getting closer and i was trying to take evasive action
the idea was let s just paddle safely around the hippos
templer s canoe led the way with the other two canoes and kayak to follow
he pulled into a little channel waiting on the others
but the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course
templer s not sure how that happened
suddenly there s this big thud
and i see the canoe like the back of it catapulted up into the air
paul templer
suddenly there s this big thud
and i see the canoe like the back of it catapulted up into the air
and evans the guide in the back of the canoe catapulted out of the canoe the clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow
evans is in the water and the current is washing evans toward a mama hippo and her calf meters feet away
so i know i ve got to get him out quickly
i don t have time to drop my clients off he yells to ben one of the other guides to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked
ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn t climb
meanwhile templer turned his canoe around to get evans
the plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into templer s canoe
i was paddling towards him getting closer and i saw this bow wave coming towards me
if you ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship it was kind of like that
i knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me he said
but i also knew that if i slapped the blade of my paddle on water that s really loud
and the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away he said
so i slapped the water and as it was supposed to do the torpedo wave stops
he was getting closer to evans but they were also getting closer to the female and calf
i m leaning over it s kind of a made for hollywood movie evans is reaching up
our fingers almost touched
and then the water between us just erupted
happened so fast i didn t see a thing
what happened next was nightmarish and surreal
my world went dark and strangely quiet templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on
from the waist down i could feel the water
i could feel i was wet in the river
from my waist up it was different
i was warm and it wasn t wet like the river but it wasn t dry either
and it was just incredible pressure on my lower back
i tried to move around i couldn t
i realized i was up to my waist down a hippo s throat
there s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth
hippos can grow up to feet long meters feet tall meters and weigh up to tons metric tonnes according to national geographic
they sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to degrees
their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all
their molars are used for eating plants but their sharp canines which might reach inches centimeters are for defense and fighting
their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion
one bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half
they re found naturally in various parts sub saharan africa particularly in east and southern africa living in or near rivers and other water sources
and they are an invasive species in colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord pablo escobar s menagerie
hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory including hyenas lions and crocodiles
they also kill people
that we know for sure
many internet sources say around a year but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don t get reported
the question i get asked the most when people find out i study hippos is is it true hippos kill more people than any animal rebecca lewison conservation ecologist and associate professor at san diego state university told cnn travel in an email interview
how to survive a cobra bite or better yet avoid one entirely
i m not entirely sure where that started but there is no authority or reliable data
people are surprised that hippos kill people
they look slow and they are mostly in water
there are some nonfatal interactions but people or hippos tend to fare badly from interactions
philip muruthi chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the african wildlife foundation said the awf doesn t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either
while more stats need to be collected one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of to higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at shark attack at and crocodile attack at
those were rather bad odds of survival working against templer
i m guessing i was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out
so i burst to the surface sucked a lungful of fresh air and i came face to face with evans the guide who i was trying to rescue
and i said we got to get out of here
so once again i m up to my waist down the hippo s throat
but this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free
paul templer
but evans was in serious trouble
templer started swimming back for him and i was just moving in for your classic lifesaver s hold when wham i got hit from below
so once again i m up to my waist down the hippo s throat
but this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free
he tried to go for his gun but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn t grab it
the hippo which turned out to be an older aggressive male spat templer out a second time
this time when i come to the surface i look around there s no sign of evans templer assumed evans had been rescued and he tried to escape himself
i m making pretty good progress and i m swimming along there and i come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and i look under my arm and until my dying day i ll remember this there s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit
this time templer was sideways in the hippo s mouth legs dangling out one side of the mouth shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth
and then he just goes berserk
when hippos are fighting the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they re attacking templer said
for me fortunately everything was happening in slow motion
so when he d go under water i d hold my breath
when we were on the surface i would take a deep breath and i would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me to stop from being ripped apart
templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll
he figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes
meanwhile apprentice guide mack in the safety kayak showing incredible bravery risking his life to save mine pulls his boat in inches from my face templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak and mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock
the expedition was still in one hell of a mess though
people living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists said lewison
most of the attacks happen in the water but because hippos raid crops on farms there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops
there are some tourists but largely the attacks are happening to local residents lewison said
human encroachment from africa s booming population makes matters worse increasing the chances of deadly interactions she said
you encounter a bear in the wild
do you know what to do next
despite the encounters gone bad sub saharan africa depends on hippos
hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit
this is through nutrient recycling from dung they consume large amounts of vegetation muruthi said
hippos attack not to eat people but to get them the hell away from them lewison said
i don t think hippos are particularly aggressive but i think when under pressure they attack
back on the rock in the zambezi templer asked mack where evans was
mack said he s gone man he s just gone
templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank but first i needed to settle myself down
he assessed the situation one man missing
the first aid kit radio and gun all gone
six scared clients two canoes and one paddle left
and his own body was shattered
my left foot was especially bad it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer he couldn t move his arms
one arm from elbow down was crushed to a pulp
blood was bubbling out of his mouth
they realized his lung was punctured
mack rolled templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with saran wrap from a plate of snacks
templer made the call no matter the risk they had to get off that rock
he was loaded into a canoe
ben paddled
the hippo kept bumping the canoe
he went from being terrified to calm on that ride back
he described a profound spiritual experience in which i had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice
like do i go or do i stay do i close my eyes and drift off or do i fight my way through this and stick around
it was so intense i thought i was going to die and when i didn t i kind of wished i would
paul templer on the pain after the attack
i chose to stick around and as soon as i made that choice it was more pain than i could ever imagine i could endure
it was so intense i thought i was going to die and when i didn t i kind of wished i would
ben and templer made it out of the river but without finding evans
his body was found three days later
they concluded he had drowned because he didn t have any signs of animal attack on him
evans did nothing wrong
the fact that he died was purely a tragedy
meanwhile some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river
a well trained zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock
and that was my bad day at the office
templer was out of the river but not out of the woods
it took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital
in a month s time he had several major surgeries
he thought he would lose one leg and both arms
his surgeon didn t think he d live
but not only did the surgeon save templer s life he saved his legs and one arm
the other arm however was beyond salvation
if you re attacked by an alligator here s how to fight for your life
he realized that in the icu when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand
it was gone
i just remember feeling devastated
i spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than i could bare
but then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved
for the next month he was emotionally all over the map
he got physical and occupational therapy in zimbabwe and then more in the united kingdom
he got a prosthesis and then just started trying to get back to life
templer muruthi and lewison all say safe outings start with education and avoiding trouble in the first place
hippos have no interest in dealing with people
stay away from them and they will leave you alone
they are not hunting humans lewison said
do not get close to them muruthi said
they don t want any intrusion
they re not predators it s by accident if they re injuring people
want close up views and photos of the creatures instead of venturing too close invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses
follow the rules
if you are a tourist and it says stay in your vehicle then stay in your vehicle
philip muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks
do not walk along well worn hippo paths stay close to your group and don t approach them from behind muruthi said
follow the rules
if you are a tourist and it says stay in your vehicle then stay in your vehicle
and even when you re in your vehicle don t drive it right to the animal
muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos
it s good for them to know you re around
hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage so avoid trekking along the river at that time muruthi said
also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce
get to know the signs of disturbed hippos muruthi advised in case you wander too closely
an agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display
also watch for a head thrown back shaking of the head grunting and snorting
these are signs you should have left already muruthi said
if you ve attracted unwanted attention muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo
they may look sluggish but they can run mph almost kph
instead you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill
muruthi lewison and templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water
if it s charging you run parallel to the water source
as with so many other protective female animals never get between a mama hippo and her young templer said
he was alone deep in the moutains
and a rattlesnake just bit him
what if you re in a small watercraft
typically if a hippo is going to be attacking you ll see it coming way before
there will be that bow wave
if you slap the water the percussion times out of will turn the hippo templer said
if you re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water get away from the canoe
the hippo is going for this big shape getting it off its territory
it s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel which the animal would have a harder time capsizing muruthi said
unlike attacks by some other wild animals humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins
once attacked there is nothing you can do muruthi said
fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape he said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain
but given the size just of a hippo head even that s a tall order
hippos typically hole punch you so there isn t much you can do if they get hold of you
rebecca lewison
hippos typically hole punch you so there isn t much you can do if they get hold of you lewison said
based on his attack templer said try not to panic when dragged underwater
remember to suck in air if on the surface
another hippo attack survivor in this national geographic video also was able to conserve her breath
she also grabbed the hippo s snout and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go
two years after that attack templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the zambezi river to date
it took three months and covered miles kilometers
how did templer find the resilience to reclaim his life
after a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair he said that his surgeon told him you re the sum of your choices
you re exactly who what and where you choose to be in life
templer said he focused on what s possible vs
what he s lost
if you look for what s possible it generally is
templer later moved to united states got married to the sister of a journalist on the record setting zambezi trip wrote the book what s left of me and is a speaker
should people be afraid to even go on safari especially in hippo areas after learning of a harrowing story like templer s
muruthi said go but go smartly
be sure to get advice from professional tour guides and then follow their guidance muruthi said
in kenya for example contact the kenya professional safari guides association he said
templer said his attack was an anomaly and he doesn t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his river run
my biggest counsel would be absolutely go and do it
but hook yourself up with someone who knows what they re doing out there
but by all means go out and experience it
