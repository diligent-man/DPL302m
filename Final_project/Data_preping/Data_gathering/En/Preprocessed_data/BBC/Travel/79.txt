liesbet collaert was about to blow up her life
she d arrived in san francisco california just three weeks earlier part of an overland journey across north america with her long term boyfriend karl
now liesbet was about to abandon her travels unthinkable abandon the plan out of character and abandon karl unbelievable
why because liesbet had fallen in love with someone else and she couldn t shake the thought that she was meant to be with him
it was and liesbet was
she d met her american boyfriend karl a couple of years earlier on a trip to australia
back in her home country of belgium liesbet was a trained teacher but while she enjoyed her job her thirst for adventure superseded everything else
liesbet was always working out ways she could work from the road always figuring out her next trip
travel has always been number one liesbet tells cnn travel today
when liesbet and karl pulled up in san francisco they planned to only stay for a week
they were crashing with a friend of karl s a guy called nik who owned a san francisco townhouse he d converted into three apartments
nik lived in one of the studios and he rented out the others
that first day after greeting nik and dumping her bag in his apartment liesbet headed back downstairs to grab a cd from the campervan
as i come into the yard i get greeted by two beautiful amazing fluffy dogs wagging their tails recalls liesbet
and of course i was totally enamored with them hanging out with them
when liesbet looked up she noticed a man standing in the doorway of the ground floor apartment smiling at her
hi i m mark he said
mark kilty he was the dogs owner and one of nik s tenants the occupant of the downstairs apartment
liesbet introduced herself explaining she and her boyfriend were staying with nik for a few days
we talked a little bit and a little bit turned into an hour recalls liesbet
liesbet s first impression of mark was that he was a very attractive tall dark haired man i was attracted to his looks more than anything else she admits
but after their extended conversation liesbet decided mark was also very well spoken and intelligent
mark was and recently divorced
he d grown up on the east coast of the us but moved to california in the late s he was a software engineer and had arrived just in time for the dot com boom
mark was pretty happy with his life separating from his wife hadn t been easy but he loved his work his dogs and his life in the bay area
but when liesbet talked about her myriad travels and her nomadic lifestyle mark was immediately fascinated
it was like she d opened up a window to a life he d never even considered but was immediately enthralled by
probably my first real attraction to her in any way was just that she was a bit of a free spirit and someone who was willing to risk a structured normal life for having a good experience mark tells cnn travel today
i was very intrigued with her lifestyle and what she was able to accomplish with relatively little financially and how much she had been able to see places and go places and experience things
liesbet crossed paths with mark multiple times over the course of the next few days
it turned out mark was good friends with his landlord nik and so mark nik liesbet and karl often hung out together
we went out for drinks recalls liesbet mark was a sailor and took us all out sailing
the group grew a little closer
mark liked liesbet but he was conscious of not crossing any lines she and karl seemed pretty committed
but as the days rolled on and the week in san francisco turned into three mark s feelings began to spill over and he started to suspect they were reciprocated
as for liesbet the time in san francisco just felt surreal
she knew she was falling for mark
and she didn t know what to do about it
karl was really looking forward to the next step of our trip we were going to meet my parents at some point in california and then we re going to go to mexico recalls liesbet
and every time he brought that up i was i was quiet
the more time progressed it was more and more emotionally laden like my heart would beat harder as we sat next to each other on the couch talking
liesbet collaert
karl encouraged liesbet and mark to spend time together it d be just him and liesbet for the next several months so he figured it was nice for them both to enjoy other social interactions while they could
the more time progressed it was more and more emotionally laden like my heart would beat harder as we sat next to each other on the couch talking recalls liesbet
the night before liesbet was due to leave she and mark found themselves alone in his apartment
mark was showing her photo albums from his college years and the two of them were sharing stories about their lives before they d met
at some point he put his arm around me and i just remember my heart going faster
and i think i turned
and i think that s how it happened says liesbet
we kissed says mark
we were both glad about it but we felt bad about it also
because obviously she was in a relationship
and i m pretty sure she was leaving the next day
when liesbet left that evening the only acknowledgment of what happened was mark s parting words
if you ever break it off with karl just let me know where you are and no matter where you are i ll come pick you up he said
the next day liesbet and karl prepared to say goodbye to san francisco
mark went to work knowing they d be gone by the time he got back
as she helped karl pack the camper liesbet battled a mounting feeling of dread
she didn t know what the future held
but she knew she couldn t carry on with karl pretending her feelings for mark meant nothing
she decided she had to tell karl the truth
i have feelings for mark she said
i think i ll end up coming back here
she tried to sound confident and determined masking the fear sadness and confusion she felt
karl seemed shocked but didn t try to persuade her to stay with him
he was very heartbroken recalls liesbet
he simply said if you think you re going to come back you d better just stay
so instead of getting into the rv together and driving on liesbet and karl went to the bank and split up their finances
then she took all her belongings out of the campervan and said goodbye to her boyfriend of three years
that was a very very hard emotional time for both of us says liesbet
she watched karl drive off in the rv wiping away tears
then she headed back into the apartment block let herself into mark s apartment and dumped her stuff in the corner
feeling emotionally and physically exhausted she climbed onto mark s bed comforted by his two dogs
then for the rest of the day i cried says liesbet
it was not an easy decision
several hours later when mark came home from work the first thing he noticed was that the campervan was gone
his heart sank
i ll probably never hear from her again he thought
shaking off the thought he parked his car and headed into the building
i go up to the apartment door and the door was unlocked which was a little bit odd recalls mark
he stepped inside expecting to be greeted by his dogs who usually waited for him at the door
instead they came out of the bedroom
they were wagging and happy to see me and i sort of got down on the ground with them as i do with dogs and hung out with them and petted them
mark comforted himself with the dogs affections pushing thoughts of liesbet out of his mind
and then i don t know four seconds later five seconds later liesbet steps out from the bedroom door
mark jumped looking at her in disbelief then swore loudly
my jaw hit the ground he says
i was just in shock
liesbet interpreted mark s reaction as an indication she d made a massive mistake
maybe this was not such a good idea she thought
the tears which had been falling freely all day threatened to start up again
but then mark got up and embraced her giving her a long hug
they stood arms around each other for a long while
then softly mark asked why she was there
i decided to stay said liesbet
she fell in love with a podcast host and flew across the world to meet her
that s how liesbet moved in with mark after knowing him for just a few weeks
after mark got over the initial shock he was thrilled and the two spent the next few weeks in a happy daze
there were a lot of emotions and a lot of excitement says mark
there was the romance of being together and actually being able to express our emotions for each other adds liesbet
it wasn t all perfect liesbet still felt guilty and bad about karl
she also questioned her decision to abandon the overland adventure
in the past i had left boyfriends for my travels she says
with mark it was the opposite i was abandoning my travels for a man so i struggled with that
plus there were logistical issues at play liesbet s tourist visa only allowed her to stay in the us for another month
she couldn t just live jobless and visaless in mark s apartment for the foreseeable future nor did she want to
but neither she nor mark felt able to make any long term plans just yet
in the end liesbet applied for a visa extension which was granted and the two put thoughts of the long term to one side and decided to just enjoy the moment
about a month after she d moved in with mark liesbet flew with him to the east coast to meet his family
a few months after that liesbet s parents came to visit
their respective families took the sudden change in circumstances pretty well and everyone got on
as time went on liesbet and mark started talking about potential adventures they could go on together when liesbet s us visa ran out
as a keen sailor mark had always dreamed of spending an extended period on the water
liesbet was prone to seasickness but she was willing to give life on the ocean a try
she was excited that mark seemed up for an adventure and as much as she was enjoying san francisco she had itchy feet
so in mark quit his job and the couple bought a sailboat planning to sail around the california coast towards south america
it was definitely a big leap of faith says mark
unfortunately the adventure got off to a bumpy start
liesbet badly struggled with her seasickness while mark s dogs hated being on the water
after just two days at sea the couple made the decision to abandon the boat put it up for sale and purchase a campervan instead
ironically i was back on plan but with a different boyfriend and two dogs says liesbet
two flight attendants fell in love on an airplane
here s what happened next
liesbet and mark spent the next year driving through central america traveling to panama and then back up to texas
the beginning says mark was a honeymoon period
you re just enjoying the company and the relationship growing and those kinds of things he says
but we definitely hit a bump
liesbet could feel mark pulling away
he wasn t really holding my hand she recalls
there was something about him that felt a little off
the situation worsened
and then when they reached honduras mark said he wanted to end things
liesbet could have left there and then and flown back to belgium
but something made her stay
and so for the last few months of the trip she and mark lived together broken up in the tight confines of the campervan
both of them were lonely and both of them struggled
they reached texas where they d arranged to stay with karl yes liesbet s ex boyfriend karl
it was now over a year since liesbet ended things with him and he was now dating someone else living happily in austin
when they d made the arrangement liesbet and mark were in love
now it was just awkward
mark stayed in the campervan in karl s drive and i was staying in karl s spare bedroom says liesbet adding it was all very ironic
things got worse before they got better one day mark drove off without telling liesbet and she had no idea if he would ever come back
three days passed and then she got a call from him out of the blue
i really regret my decision mark said
i want us to start over
today mark thinks the break up was the result of him feeling overwhelmed his life had changed so quickly and so drastically and spending hours a day with someone in a tight space isn t easy
but when he drove off alone in austin he had a lot of time to think about what i want to do and who i would like to do it with
everything sort of pointed back to her he says
liesbet and mark reunited but this time they thought long and hard before diving in
when we got back together we had some very long conversations about what we could improve in our relationship about things that we each needed personally to make this work for both of us so that we can have a good relationship but also so we can both as individuals be in a better place says mark
from there liesbet and mark continued traveling together and both started working freelance on the road
they decided to give the sailing dream another shot this time buying a bigger boat a catamaran which was more stable and comfortable for both liesbet and the dogs
the couple sailed to the bahamas then towards the dominican republic
later they sailed down the panama canal and on the galapagos islands to french polynesia
throughout this experience liesbet and mark operated as a team says liesbet
in liesbet and mark got married
their first celebration was a small simple legal ceremony with just a couple of friends as witnesses
three years later they had a larger wedding party with all their loved ones in st
maarten
during the ceremony mark belatedly proposed he d never officially done so in and it felt only fitting to do so now in front of liesbet s friends and family
it was says liesbet both funny and romantic
a whirlwind romance began in a brussels chocolate shop
it turned into a love story spanning nearly years
one day in mark was alone on the catamaran when he noticed a lump on his chest just above his right nipple
earlier that week mark had also tripped and bumped his right chest
it hurt a lot more than i thought it should hurt he recalls
this combined with the lump set off alarm bells in mark s mind
the year before his sister had passed away from ovarian cancer
what were the chances of him also having cancer and what were the chances of him having what looked like male breast cancer
he pushed the thoughts out of his mind mentioning the lump to liesbet briefly in passing when she got home
but a month later mark and liesbet decided the lump wasn t really noticeably getting worse but it wasn t getting better
a biopsy in a hospital in tahiti confirmed mark had a type of breast cancer
your whole world shatters when you hear those words you have cancer says mark
you don t believe it at first says liesbet
the two also struggled with the relative rarity of a male breast cancer diagnosis
it was a big emotional rollercoaster the first few weeks says mark
mark returned to the us for treatment
he didn t struggle too much physically but he found the emotional side tough especially just after losing my sister a year ago having that fresh in my mind of what cancer does intimately in a family relationship
he felt elation when he was eventually given the all clear
but there s definitely a lot of elements of depression that go with that kind of diagnosis in that kind of situation because it haunts you for the rest of your life he says
today mark manages his fears and uncertainties as best he can
i m very fortunate that it turned out the way that it did
i don t know if lucky is the right word
but you might say that he says
mark and liesbet supported each other through mark s illness
then when mark was finished with treatment they started wondering what to do next
they still wanted adventure but felt the need for a new chapter
they left behind sailing and started traveling north america house sitting and pet sitting
later they bought another campervan and got back on the road again traveling further afield once more
they met while hiking and fell in love
two months later she was diagnosed with cancer
fast forward to today and nearly twenty years after they first met mark and liesbet are still traveling the world together
they document their travels on their blog roaming about and liesbet also published a travel memoir called plunge one woman s pursuit of a life less ordinary
the couple don t see themselves settling in one place any time soon but they have a mental list of places they ve visited and loved that they could see themselves perhaps returning to one day
liesbet and mark still see themselves as a strong team
traveling the world and navigating difficulties along the way especially mark s illness has only forged them closer together over the decades
i can t imagine anyone else that i would have ever gone on the last years of my life with and this adventure we ve been on
mark kilty
these are big life changing emotional things that happened to us says liesbet
i think because of the downs that we ve had we did grow closer and we can face pretty much everything right now to be honest and i know that sounds grand or whatever but i think we can handle a lot as a couple right now
looking back on their life together mark says he simply feels joy and happiness and contentment
i can t imagine anyone else that i would have ever gone on the last years of my life with and this adventure we ve been on he says
for liesbet their story illustrates the importance of living life with no regrets
she s never regretted her spontaneous decision to stay behind with mark in san francisco even if it hadn t worked out she knew she had to give life with mark a go
i feel like you shouldn t regret things that you could have tried she says
i feel things are worth a try
