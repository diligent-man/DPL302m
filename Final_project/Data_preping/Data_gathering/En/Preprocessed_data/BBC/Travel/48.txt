it would be difficult to find an airline that didn t consider a pilot flying while drunk a fireable offense
but a newly proposed regulation in india could also take action against pilots who use perfume
india s office of the director general of civil aviation dgca which oversees the country s aviation industry recently proposed an update to its bylaws regarding alcohol consumption
there is already reference to things other than alcoholic drinks that could cause a positive breath test namely mouthwash in the guidelines
however a new section bolded here specifically mentions perfume
it reads no crew member shall consume any drug formulation or use any substance such as mouthwash tooth gel perfume or any such product which has alcoholic content
this may result into positive breath analyzer test
the text continues any crew member who is undergoing such medication shall consult the company doctor before undertaking flying assignment
while perfumes can contain trace amounts of alcohol it s unclear if wearing perfume on one s body can trigger a false positive breath test
the official air safety requirements for the dgca were ratified in august
the proposed addition is up for public comment through october
pilot drunkenness has occasionally been an issue in the aviation industry
in katsutoshi jitsukawa a pilot for japan airlines was sentenced to months in prison after a breath test taken shortly after takeoff showed that his blood alcohol level was nine times the legal limit
and in the us a delta pilot named gabriel lyle schroeder was escorted off a fully boarded plane pre takeoff when he was suspected of being under the influence of alcohol
delta s alcohol policy is among the strictest in the industry and we have no tolerance for violation an airline representative told cnn at the time
