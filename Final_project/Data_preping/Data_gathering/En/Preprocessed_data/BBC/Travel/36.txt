closed to the public for more than a decade the stunning zeyrek inili hamam has just reopened its wooden doors to the world
located in istanbul s zeyrek neighborhood on the european side of the bosporus adjacent to the historic fatih district the bathhouse was built in the s by mimar sinan the architect in chief to illustrious ottoman sultans such as suleiman the magnificent
inili means tiled in turkish highlighting the hamam s most prominent interior design feature the bathouse was once covered in thousands of bright blue iznik tiles
open for five centuries serving the public mostly as a hamam but briefly as a saddlery and a storeroom in the late s the hamam was rather dilapidated by the time it closed in
the walls were covered in mold their covering of iznik tiles nowhere to be seen
the hamam reopened temporarily in for the istanbul biennial and is now about to get a whole new lease of life
after a year closure inili hamam will reopen on september first as an exhibition venue then from march as a public bath once more with segregated sections for men and women
as well as receiving a full face lift the hamam will also get a contemporary art space beneath the arches of the byzantine cistern that once filled its brass taps with water a new museum that pieces together the building s history and a laurel filled urban garden
it marks the second major historical restoration project by real estate developers the marmara group which bought the building in
when we bought the hamam we didn t know any of the stories behind it
but in zeyrek wherever you dig you find something says koza yazgan the project s creative director
in the men s section we found these rectangular tiles different from the usual hexagonal ones
they were on the wall and had this farsi poem with different verses on each tile
we translated and researched them and found they had been misplaced at some point they weren t where sinan had originally placed them
when the hamam was first built the walls were covered in around tiles but only a few remain
some were misplaced others stolen and some were damaged by fires and earthquakes
tiles were even sold to foreign museums in the late th century the marmara group have traced many to faraway private collections and museums including london s v a
a team of archaeologists and historians at the hamam helped those institutions to identify exactly where their iznik tiles came from
as for the mysterious farsi tiles yazgan continues we decided not to leave them where we found them but to exhibit them in the museum
in turkey a modern city sits alongside a mythical site
designed by german firm atelier br eckner whose previous projects include the much anticipated grand egyptian museum in cairo and the louvre abu dhabi the inili hamam s museum will showcase some of the many roman ottoman and byzantine artefacts found during the restoration from coins to unusual graffiti of foreign ships
visitors can also peruse an array of eclectic objects used by past hamam goers including sparkling mother of pearl clogs called nalin
naturally a whole floor of the museum will be dedicated to the hamam s incredible iznik tiles the pi ce de resistance being a futuristic augmented reality ar display that transports you to the bathhouse as it was in mimar sinan s day digitally overlaying the white walls in their full turquoise tiled glory
it s an impressive attempt to reconstruct something long gone but yazgan considered it necessary
considering how the city has changed over the last years i think it s more important than ever to protect these historic sites
otherwise they will all be lost she says
though its tiered timber houses initially sprung up around the wealthy th century pantokrator monastery now zeyrek mosque zeyrek is a distinctly working class district today
life centers on the spice and meat markets that spill out onto the streets while the fruity scent of home cooked perde pilav a chicken grapes and rice dish from a less affluent region of eastern turkey emanates from the restaurants
while it s part of the unesco listed area of istanbul zeyrek is nothing like the nearby ayasofya neighborhood where hagia sofia the blue mosque and the topkapi palace all stand
here foreign tourists are a rarity
the streets of zeyrek produce a lot of noise and the over square foot hamam offers a peaceful escape
a kem g z evil eye dangles from the front door ensuring any ill meaning spirits stay outside
exactly as it would have been years ago the oak door is heavy and thick only it s so new it still has that straight off the sawmill smell
once the threshold is crossed the visitor moves through a series of three rooms a process typical of all turkish baths
the first is the cold or more accurately room temperature room the camekan where guests are invited to undress and relax
reclining on couches admiring the architecture and sipping on hot turkish tea or coffee are all encouraged
turkey s hidden alpine wonderland
next is the warm room a dry seating area where the body acclimatizes to temperatures of around degrees celsius farenheit
the last room is the steamy hararet heated up to degrees celsius farenheit and containing a flat marble slab
you lie on the g bek ta the belly stone and relax says yazgan
it s a cleaning space both spiritually and physically one hour of getting away from earthly things robed attendants wash and massage their supine clients there
ottoman know how and seamless minimalism come together inside the inili hamam to create the ultimate zone out space
scandi style wooden cabinets lockers and door stops prevent the modern facilities from feeling too clinical
the glass stars on the domed ceilings a signature of ottoman hamam design allow just enough natural light to shimmer in but not so much that it dazzles
original ottoman details are showcased to stimulate the mind sections of the original brickwork sinan s structural reinforcements and the kaleidoscopic iznik tiles but they never disrupt the atmosphere of tranquility
initially while the hamam s bathing rooms are still dry the inili hamam will host a one off contemporary art exhibition with specially commissioned works dedicated to themes of ruin history and healing three words which sum up the place
once the exhibition closes in march the baths will be pumped with water and returned to their original function
yazgan says the zeyrek inili hamam will closely replicate time honored ottoman bathtime traditions
instead of swedish massages and scented oils there ll be hot and humid rooms joint cracking chiropractic treatments and bubble based massages in which clouds of puffy lather are scrubbed into the skin
however yazgan highlights one st century distinction that sets inili apart from turkey s uber traditional hamams
usually in hamams the design of the men s section is taller and more elaborate
they have more muqarnas decorated vaulted ceilings and tiles
but we ll have rotating days for each gendered section so everybody can enjoy each side
the secret side of the mediterranean by boat in turkey
seeing the hamam s pristine empty chambers now it s hard to envision it filled with people
stepping into the garden where only a thin layer of shrubbery masks the raw goat legs on display in the butcher s shops it also seems slightly out of place with its surroundings
but the marmara group believes that the newly restored hamam could alter the dynamic of the neighborhood completely utilizing its underrated historic sites to turn zeyrek into a destination for cultural tourism
even the local shopkeepers are asking should i sell soaps or peshtemals traditional ottoman towels we re even thinking of doing a zeyrek map showing where hamam guests can visit other attractions in the area or eat in a historical space says yazgan
there s plenty to do besides the zeyrek mosque the monumental roman aqueduct of valens and the baroque s leymaniye mosque mimar sinan s magnum opus are all within a minute walk
while a rise in visitor numbers could put the neighborhood at risk of gentrification the hamam has the potential to join istanbul s ever expanding portfolio of cool cultural venues somewhere one can immerse themselves in istanbul s cosmopolitan past taking part in an old ritual
with the museum relaxation element and historical layers the hamam is like a microcosm of istanbul says yazgan
it s certainly set to be the only place in the city where you can learn something new have an ar experience drink a cup of coffee get undressed in public and still feel relaxed when you come out
