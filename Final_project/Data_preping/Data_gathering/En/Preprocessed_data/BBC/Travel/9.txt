barely a day goes by without railways making the headlines in britain
industrial unrest crumbling infrastructure rising costs a wildly unpopular government plan to close station ticket offices staff shortages late running trains and the chaos around a money burning project to build the so called high speed hs rail line it feels like an industry on the verge of a nervous breakdown
as the th anniversary of the world s first public railway opened between stockton and darlington in northeast england in approaches britain s railways are in turmoil
while some governments across the world invest billions to reset and de carbonize travel habits in a post covid world the uk s department for transport is even as trains bulge at the seams axing key projects train services and sidelining much needed trains to save money
congestion neglected victorian infrastructure and frequent strikes are eating away at the british public s deep rooted affection for rail travel

meanwhile essential legislation to restructure the uk railway industry under a plan published in has been kicked down the road by an increasingly pro car prime minister rishi sunak
industry morale is at its lowest point for decades says highly respected ex railway managing director michael holden
as if that wasn t bad enough sunak s right wing conservative government has pulled the rug out from under the controversial and vastly over budget hs project
hs was originally meant to connect london with the northerly cities of birmingham manchester and leeds in the name of trying to reduce the uk s north south economic divide
the leeds link has already been scrapped but this week sunak cancelled the manchester line
the announcement on wednesday sparked a furious reaction from lawmakers and business leaders outside london as well as many from the prime minister s own party
what was once billed as a landmark mega project to power an interconnected britain into the oncoming century has now been reduced to a mile link that for a price tag of billion billion will barely improve on existing services
the betrayal that could kill britain s railway romance
the revised plan retains much of the original high cost and controversy for few of the benefits and many people are unhappy about it
hs had strong opposition from communities along its route who complained of landscape destruction and disruption from which they d see little or no gain
ecological protesters also fought to block it to protect ancient forests and fragile landscapes
now those in favor of the original project are dismayed by its drastic pruning
what was planned to offer up to trains per hour serving many of the uk s biggest cities will now be reduced to just a shuttle service a couple of fast trains an hour between london and birmingham says rail engineer and industry commentator gareth dennis
it s a dramatic reduction
austria offers free rail travel for a year if you get a tattoo
it s desperately sad
i despair at the future for our children and future generations
whatever happens now even if the next government decides to reverse the decision and press ahead it s going to take a lot longer and cost a lot more to build
dennis says that while it was flawed hs s scale back will impact the uk s efforts to accelerate carbon reduction to meet long term goals and demonstrates a lack of commitment to the future
it s incredible that we can t build a new inter city railway but it s so much more than that it s the inability of this country and its institutions to do any forward planning or make any commitment to the future
the british rail industry is in a real crisis at the moment
the one thing it was banking on was hs delivering a bit of breathing space to allow more time for catching up on the backlog of track and structure maintenance
without hs that crisis only deepens
sunak has said that billion will be saved by cancelling hs s manchester connection insisting the money will be redistributed to other transport schemes across the country including roads and railways
he said the government will reinvest every single penny banked from cutting hs
every region outside of london will receive the same or more government investment than they would have done under hs with quicker results he said offering no timeline
while all this rumbles on britain s long suffering rail passengers continue to endure unacceptable and occasionally bizarre treatment from train operators
comedian james nokise went viral after tweeting a running commentary of his kafkaesque hour journey from london to edinburgh on september
i m not quite sure how to explain what s happened tonight because it s still happening but here goes at pm i jumped on a train from london to edinburgh
it was comfy it was quietin hindsight too good to last
hundreds of passengers were left stranded on their journey to scotland after a train was cancelled as it approached the northwest england city of preston and subsequent trains were either already full or cancelled
at enormous expense a fleet of taxis was then hired to take passengers on to their destinations many hours later than scheduled
the twists and turns of nokise s storytelling ensured that the incident gained nationwide attention but incredibly the situation was repeated on the same route just four days later
avanti has seen apologized for the train cancelation and says it has offered passengers compensation
it s a pattern of events that frustrated regulars and hard pressed frontline workers recognize all too well
flying without wings the world s fastest trains
poor punctuality and frequent cancellations play badly with passengers all over the world but combined with some of europe s highest ticket prices the effect on the uk public s perception has been devastating
customer satisfaction levels have dipped alarmingly in recent years although britain s railways are not alone in that respect
dozens of countries are struggling to cope with demand on rail networks dating from the th century spending billions to overcome the effects of decades of underinvestment in essential national infrastructure
congestion overworked and aging equipment post covid staff shortages industrial action climate change and antisocial behavior are contributing to poor reliability and declining customer satisfaction in countries such as germany and belgium according to the most recent eurobarometer surveys
but many countries in europe and asia are also spending big to decarbonize train travel add new lines stations and trains to encourage more travelers
what sets britain and more specifically england apart from others is the byzantine structure of its railways a legacy of their hurried privatization by a previous conservative government in the mid s
then state owned british rail was split into regional train companies and thousands of smaller private contractors delivering everything from train maintenance to track repairs and cleaning services
over the last three decades the complexity of those arrangements has become increasingly expensive and difficult to manage often leaving it unclear who is to blame when things go wrong
until the pandemic the top problem for britain s railways was coping with demand trying to run more trains on a network largely dating from the th century was hurting reliability and punctuality
however the collapse of passenger numbers due to covid lockdowns undermined its franchising model
since the uk government has effectively renationalized its rail system spending more than billion to keep the network running in up from around billion a year in according to the office of rail and road orr
meanwhile ticket revenue is down by between million and million per month due to a huge decline in weekday commuting
broadly supported government proposals to regain control by establishing a new body to be known as great british railways have failed to materialize two years after they were revealed causing industry frustration
high speed trains are racing across the world
but not in america
uk rail has the potential to help the government deliver on its agenda to grow the economy boost jobs and skills level up and decarbonize darren caplan chief executive of the rail industry association trade body told trade media shortly before wednesday s hs announcement but to do this it needs certainty about the structure of the industry for the months and years ahead
caplan said cutting back hs was unnecessary and defeatist and put a question mark over the uk s government capability to deliver rail restructuring or other major projects
the department for transport says great british railways is a once in a generation reform that will transform the way the sector works
despite lack of progress in its creation the uk s transport minister mark harper told lawmakers as recently as june that the government remained committed to it
a successful railway needs to change to reflect passenger demand and that is exactly what this government are going to deliver he said
lack of clarity is also stifling efforts to adapt as travel habits change
while orr figures show that demand is back to pre pandemic levels on many days and often more than that at weekends regular weekday commuting is increasingly a thing of the past
even though many routes are suffering from overcrowding recent months have seen a raft of trains withdrawn from service some almost new or recently refurbished to extend their lives in projects costing tens of millions of dollars
more worryingly some of britain s newest trains most notably the flagship intercity express iet electric and bi mode units require expensive repairs to body cracks just a few years after their introduction
hundreds of iet and regional carriages are affected and repair costs will run into tens of millions
cost saving measures put forward by the government include the closure of hundreds of station ticket offices and the adoption of controversial working practices like removing guards from some trains
while there s widespread acceptance of the need to modernize in certain areas the proposed changes have been the catalyst for more than a year of industrial action by rail unions the most prolonged strikes for more than years
how one european country is planning a rail revolution
the increasingly bitter dispute about pay and working practices has involved drivers train crews signalers and support staff and has regularly paralyzed the country s rail network
ticket office closures have proved especially unpopular with staff and passengers alike
more than objections were received as part of a government consultation on plans to close around sites leaving all but the largest city stations relying on vending machines or online services
although most tickets are now sold online campaigners and accessibility groups say closing offices will hit elderly and disabled travelers tourists and lower income users who may not have digital skills or access
michael holden the ex railway managing director told cnn travel that the current government seems more concerned with the bottom line than finding solutions to britain s railway woes
the overwhelming mood music remains to reduce costs no matter what the impact on customer service and revenue he told cnn travel
the approach to hs is in line with this mindset just cut the cost never mind what it does to the business case
holden said that the future of uk railways was gloomy and even the possibility of the opposition labour party beating the conservatives in s upcoming general election would offer little hope
what happens after that is anyone s guess but it seems likely that the early years of any incoming labour party government are more likely to be focused on areas such as housing social care and education he said
this means rail policy could continue to drift for quite some time to come
in the face of this bewildering onslaught britain s front line rail staff continue to work minor miracles to ensure that passengers get where they need to go most of the time
it s an industry that observers say often relies on the passion and commitment of its people to deliver timetable promises
however as staff and assets get stretched ever tighter and the challenges of maintaining a th century network in a changing climate become more obvious many are hoping answers are coming down the line very soon
