France’s health minister has assured the French public that there’s no reason for widespread panic as Paris reports a widespread rise in bedbugs
Speaking to French radio station France Inter Aurelien Rousseau condeded that when you see them around you when you have bedbugs in your home it’s a nightmare but assured listeners that we haven’t been invaded by bedbugs
The National Institute for the Study and Control of Bedbugs INELP told CNN on Monday that the level of bedbug infestation in France is worse than previous years but treatable
Bedbugs have been increasingly present in France for two or three years now regularly peaking in the summer
But this year we’ve gone beyond all other years INELP president Marie Effroy said adding that the jump started at the end of August beginning of September
Effroy went on to say that there’s a bedbug problem but at the same time there’s a kind of paranoia going on because people hear about bedbugs
When asked about the recent reported sightings Effroy said people see bedbugs everywhere but added that sometimes it’s not bedbugs
Earlier this week the French government vowed action to reassure and protect the public
The French transport ministry confirmed to CNN that transport minister Clement Beaune will convene a meeting on Wednesday to take stock of the situation and to strengthen measures following the reported surge in numbers of the blood-sucking insect
French transport operators say they remain vigilant about bedbugs following reports of what were said to be sightings in public transport
RATP the operator behind the Parisian metro told CNN on Monday that each sighting is taken into account and is subject to a treatment adding that these last few days there have been no proven cases of bedbugs recorded in our equipment
RATP added that a report was made on Wednesday last week but after an assessment no presence of bedbugs was recorded on the train
Railway company SNCF which operates many trains in the country including the Eurostar told CNN that it takes reports of pests very seriously but that to date we have not observed any presence or proven reports of bedbugs
There have been recent calls for government action from Paris officials and trade unions after several videos of bedbugs circulated on social media
In the videos the bedbugs were said to be spotted on public transport and other public locations such as cinemas
Speaking to French TV station LCI on Friday deputy mayor of Paris Emmanuel Gregoire called the phenomenon widespread
You have to understand that in reality no one is safe obviously there are risk factors but in reality you can catch bedbugs anywhere and bring them home he said
Three years ago the French government launched an anti-bedbug campaign which includes a dedicated website and an information hotline as numbers of the insect surged
But Gregoire said that despite that plan there are million people who come into Paris every day and bedbugs do not stop on the outskirts of the city
An expert from France’s national health and sanitary body Anses said the problem was an emerging phenomenon in France and almost everywhere in the world
It’s mainly due to the movement of people populations traveling the fact that people stay in short-term accommodation and bring back bedbugs in their suitcases or luggage Johanna Fite from the Anses department of risk assessment told CNN
She added there was an escalation in numbers because bedbugs were increasingly resistant to insecticides
We are observing more and more bedbug populations which are resistant so there is no miracle treatment to get rid of them Fite said
French health minister Aurelien Rousseau also dimissed the idea that the rise in bedbugs is related to imigration
It’s got nothing to do with immigration it’s related to movement when you come back from abroad you might bring bedbugs back with you he told radio station French Inter
Meanwhile the Paris deputy mayor warned against hysteria over the issue noting there had been an increase in Parisians who are referring to the town hall’s information services for information on bedbugs
Professional companies which intervene in residential areas are telling us that currently the proportion of interventions for bedbugs is atypical compared to normal and is increasing rapidly he said
The news comes as Paris gets ready to host the Olympics Games but officials say they are not worried
There is no threat to the Olympic Games Gregoire said
Bedbugs existed before and they will exist afterward he added saying the games were an opportunity for everybody to work together on the issue
