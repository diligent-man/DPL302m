when ludovica sannazzaro natta introduces herself to new people she always leads with the key facts
she s about to turn
she s italian
she s a very proud scorpio she studied musical theater in los angeles and new york
then she ll add an unexpected extra detail into the mix
i live in a castle full time
sannazzaro natta moved into the roomed turreted fairytale castle sannazzaro when she was four years old
sannazzaro natta is descended from italian nobility and her father is a count
this medieval fortress located in picturesque countryside near giarole northern italy has been in her family for generations
the previous generation used castle sannazzaro primarily as a summer home but in sannazzaro natta s parents decided to move from milan and make the castle their full time residence taking their young daughter with them
when i moved here it was just so normal for me she tells cnn travel today
it was just my home and where i was going to live for the rest of my life
while the castle was normal for young sannazzaro natta she still recalls the thrill of discovering the abundance of rooms in the castle there are bedrooms bathrooms as well as sitting rooms a library a balloom and a dining room not to mention the moat a chapel and secret passageways
her parents soon realized that in a castle games of hide and seek can last a long time
i would just run around the castle sannazzaro natta recalls
my parents couldn t find me sometimes because i thought it was so funny to hide inside closets
sannazzaro natta has an older brother but he s years her senior so sannazzaro natta spent her childhood exploring the castle with her gang of friends
the kids would spend long days inventing tales of princesses witches and wizards amid extremely appropriate surroundings
the castle says sannazzaro natta was a very creative place to spend her formative years
i grew up with harry potter and narnia and all those things she recalls
of course the castle was absolutely great to recreate those kinds of atmospheres and fantasy worlds so it would be our own harry potter in my castle
as a teenager sannazzaro natta attended boarding school elsewhere in italy
with that distance and her growing maturity sannazzaro natta developed more conflicted feelings about her palatial childhood home
i didn t really know how to tell people about living in a castle she says
she became aware that this particular thing about myself can change their view about me their opinion on me and found herself holding back the information until she felt she d developed a good rapport with a potential friend
i live in a castle
that s so not normal she realized
that s very unique and special
while sannazzaro natta began reckoning with that privilege and what it meant she also became fascinated by castle sannazaro s history and how it intertwines with her own family legacy
it s almost years of history between this place and between my family she says
she helped her father sift through old family letters
she shadowed paranormal investigators who came to investigate potential ghostly goings on
she researched her family tree to understand how the castle came to be built in the first place
the year old who spent three years living in the tower of london
after graduating high school sannazzaro natta moved to the us to study musical theater
her new american friends were even more dumbfounded than her italian schoolmates when she lifted the curtain on her family home
but by then sannazzaro natta was more comfortable in herself and felt able to own her story
i m not going to hide a part of me just because i m scared of what they re going to think she decided
if they really want to know me they re going to know me with this specific thing because it is part of me
then midway through sannazzaro natta s us studies covid hit
like many pandemic era college students she found herself decamping to her parents house only of course her parents house was a castle
i live in a castle
that s so not normal
that s very unique and special
ludovica sannazzaro natta
sannazzaro natta saw the fortress through fresh eyes after her time away
i was like oh i just love this place
sometimes i don t appreciate it as much as i should
probably because it s my home
and it s so normal for me
but i truly truly love this place
with this newfound appreciation of the castle came the birth of sannazzaro natta s social media account the castle diary
in between her studies sannazzaro natta passed the time posting videos on tiktok and instagram summing up what life s really like in a medieval castle
yes it s beautiful she explained but there s also poor wi fi a lot of rooms to clean and drafts aplenty
it was march and her videos provided some well timed pandemic escapism
plus everyone was talking about the netflix series bridgerton and sannazzaro natta seemed to be living some real life version of that
her tiktok account quickly gained traction
as her following grew sannazzaro natta leaned into the period drama of it all enlisting her mother to sew her gowns that would look more at place in the s than the s
today sannazzaro natta rarely appears in modern clothing in her videos and fully embraces the princess aesthetic on social media
at the same time she s still committed to showcasing the reality of castle life
she still makes videos about the castle s unexpected quirks from its multiple old toilets to the frustration of forgetting your keys and ascending several flights of spiral staircases to track them down
and to be clear sannazzaro natta isn t actually a princess although she does stand to inherit her father s title and become a countess one day which is pretty bridgerton esque although the title has no real meaning in republican italy
they bought a huge rundown italian castle and transformed it into a luxury retreat
sannazzaro natta s social media presence has become a family affair her mother helps with her outfits while her father often pops up in front of the camera and her brother helps with the administrative and financial side of sannazzaro natta s social media fame
the sannazzaro natta family have been pleasantly surprised by the widespread interest in the videos not least because it s provided a boost to the on site bed and breakfast they run at the castle
that s right if you want to live like sannazzaro natta for the day you can six of the eighteen bedrooms in the castle are available for vacationers to rent
more rooms are available to rent for weddings or other large events
the castle is around an hour away from milan turin and genoa and meters from giarole train station
this area is very famous for its landscapes sannazzaro natta says
it s full of these little towns
there s beautiful hills she says
of course the food is amazing
and the area is very well known also for wine
so there are tons of different wineries
of the most beautiful villages in italy
sannazzaro natta says she loves nothing better than when the castle is full of guests and pulsating with energy whether that s thanks to visits from her disbelieving delighted american friends whose reactions to the castle she often documents on social media or via tourists
that for sannazzaro natta is when her home comes alive so if her social media boosts visitors all the better
the reason why my dad opened the bed and breakfast was because he wanted the castle to be lived in
he wanted people to see and breathe this reality she says
and i want the exact same thing
inspired by the success of her social media aesthetic sannazzaro natta is planning upcoming public events that embrace what she calls the fantasy of the castle
first up she hopes to organize a historical themed ball in
i have something so unique and special that i want to share with people
ludovica sannazzaro natta
now that she s an adult sannazzaro natta is increasingly aware of the costs and upkeep associated with castle living
expanding into hosting balls and historical events could also be a way to ensure the longevity of the castle something she has a vested interest in as she alongside her brother will inherit the property one day
sannazzaro natta says she is also still pursuing musical theater and is currently fantasizing about playing one of the six wives of henry viii featured in the musical comedy six all of whom knew a thing or two about castles
she d love to host a performance at castle sannazzaro
sannazzaro natta says ultimate goal is to share the atmosphere of this beautiful place with everyone she can whether via social media or in person
i have something so unique and special that i want to share with people she says
because i don t think that a lot of people know about this reality
they don t even think that it exists unless it s in movies
