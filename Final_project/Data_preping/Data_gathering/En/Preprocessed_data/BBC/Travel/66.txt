in the early s on his first day of work at a fine dining restaurant rookie chef simon rogan was led out of the kitchen s back door
waiting for him in the alley were a box of oyster shells and a piece of sandpaper
the chef wanted me to use sandpaper to flatten the oyster shell so it d sit perfectly on the plate at the right level rogan tells cnn travel
they were rock oysters so they were quite sharp
my hands were absolutely cut to shreds
once that painful first task was complete the then twenty something british chef was quickly given another chore squeeze the juice out of an entire box of lemons
my hands were throbbing and burning with the lemon juice and all the cuts
it took about three weeks for them to get back to normal rogan says squinting his eyes as he recalls the pain
thinking about it now i m sure it was an initiation to the kitchen that said this is as good as it gets
you ve got to earn your stripes
it s gonna be hard
we re gonna push you
the world s best restaurants for revealed
the young chef was undeterred by the brutality as it was just an ordinary part of what he calls the dog eat dog kitchen world in those days
though uncomfortable rogan s experiences echo the many negative portrayals of kitchens that have appeared in recent food focused movies and tv series
from shows like comedy drama the bear which just entered its second season to popular horror comedy film the menu these fictitious tales depict anxiety inducing kitchens led by tyrannical chefs ruling over weary staff
yelling chaos manipulation and food hurling are the norm
meanwhile reality tv shows glorifying intense and even toxic kitchen culture such as hell s kitchen have been captivating audiences for years
as the saying goes where there s smoke there s usually fire
away from the cameras it seems these dramatized portrayals aren t off the mark
in recent years the industry has faced a tsunami of expos s highlighting alleged abuses and tales of exploitation in kitchens around the world
among the more shocking of the accusations in new york city s spotted pig was hit with a series of sexual harassment claims
earlier this year dozens spoke out about being allegedly harassed and abused by barbara lynch the famed chef behind high profile boston restaurants menton and no
park with some claiming they were threatened with knives and groped
lynch has denied the accusations
restaurants in copenhagen have also come under fire following a expos by the financial times that called out gruesome tales that allegedly happened in the city s kitchens
one employee recalled being accidentally burnt by hot coffee and claimed they weren t allowed to go to the hospital for treatment during their shift

earlier this year one the best restaurants in the world copenhagen s noma announced it was closing owner ren redzepi claiming his business was unsustainable financially and emotionally the financial times report from june said the restaurant had only just started paying interns after claims it was making them work over hours per week unpaid
a spokesman for noma told the paper that complaints against the restaurant mischaracterized its intern program
even without the scandals the long hours that come with working in a restaurant are grueling
just last week celebrity chef michel roux jr
announced that he will be closing his two michelin starred london restaurant le gavroche next january to make time for a better work life balance
but amid many declarations of the death of fine dining rogan feels optimistic about the future of the industry and says positive changes are happening
a lot has changed
i think those days of accepting these behaviors as the norm are gone and rightfully so he says
there has never been a better time to join the industry
the pay is good and the conditions are so much better
the movies and dramas are entertaining but they aren t a true picture of what s going on in the industry these days
today four decades since he began his career as a chef rogan has become one of the most influential and decorated chefs in the world
he is chef owner of nine restaurants and still counting around the world including the three michelin star l enclume in cartmel england and the one michelin starred roganic hong kong
rogan admits evolution is a process and he wasn t always his best self in the kitchen
i was a bit of a hot head he recalls
i sold everything my home my sofa my stereo my cat to open l enclume
when you do that you want nothing but the best to get to where you want to be
how you worked in the past for your bosses also rubs off on you
there were days i treated people not quite how i should have not aggressively or violently but just intensely
maybe not talking to people right sometimes or not wishing people good morning
as the pressures of the business took a toll he began losing people
inside the world s smallest restaurant for just two guests
your standards depend on these people
you re as good as the team behind you
then when you lose these people this got you to do things differently says rogan
in his case change was a necessity he needed to stop losing people and build consistency in his kitchens
in the years that followed building a healthy restaurant group became part of rogan s philosophy
among his methods to boost morale was to offer staff a shorter work week
his uk establishments are among the few fine dining restaurants in the world that embrace a three and a half day work week
his hong kong restaurant might just be the only high end venue in the city to offer a four day work week
you re grumpy because you ve worked seven days and you don t have any sleep says rogan
the hours per day are still long
but instead of working to hours per week it s about hours per week
a commis chef novice chef in our rural location makes about per annum says rogan
the median average salary in the united kingdom was in
and the average salary for chefs that year was
we decided to close all the restaurants in cartmel over two days sunday and monday
so the staff can fraternize together
they enjoy each other s company says rogan
together with another days to rest during the regular work week the staff is fully refreshed when they are in the restaurants he says
rogan says he also tries to cultivate a desirable working atmosphere
for instance when there is a big harvest on his farm which sits next to three of his cartmel restaurants he throws a big barbecue party for all the staff from accounting to housekeeping where they all enjoy some time together
we ll get a bouncy castle some of those big inflatables
we do fun things together says rogan painting a picture of camaraderie that is a far cry from his early experiences
as a result rogan says retention rates have increased which in turn has helped lower training costs while keeping the quality of the food and service in his restaurants consistent
l enclume received its first michelin star in its second star in and a third star in
asia s best bars for announced
this year the group welcomes the first batch of graduates from its newly founded culinary school the academy by simon rogan
all graduates including one former employee who worked as a dishwasher decided to stay on to work for rogan after an month paid stint
instead of worrying about staff shortages rogan pours his energy into opening new projects for his growing team
i want to make the best of myself and to try to come out on the other side because my generation of chefs finally get a position where we can make a difference he says
we are the ones that have decided that things need to change because we want people to come into the industry
no one s going to come to the industry with such a notorious reputation
other restaurants that have made efforts to reduce work hours and offer more benefits to staff are also seeing the dividends
dig an american chain restaurant that sells casual healthy food in the us offers its employees the option of working a four day shift while maintaining the same number of hours since
most of the employees said in a survey that they preferred the new arrangement
meanwhile tenya a japanese restaurant chain in singapore announced that a four day work week and pay raises have helped them fill positions faster than when they were offering a five day work week
making drastic changes isn t easy in the cutthroat restaurant world
in caleb ng and his brother joshua ng opened the first twins kitchen in hong kong
the duo now runs eight coffee shops and restaurants in hong kong and shanghai two of the cities where rents and labor costs are notoriously high and a ninth restaurant is now in the works in shanghai
most of their restaurants offer a five day work week and a hour work shift as opposed to the six day work week followed by many of the region s eateries
having a shorter work week has been a great help for our staff to enjoy life outside of work says caleb ng
we were all quite young when we started but now many of us have families
of course four days would be great but it isn t financially feasible for us right now
that said ng agrees that change is imminently needed on the whole
after the pandemic our identities are no longer only centered around our works we want more time for families and for lives outside of our job he says
unfortunately our line of work is one of the few jobs where people can t work from home
so if you don t offer more benefits and higher salaries no one would want to join
ng equates it to a game of balance
he says sustainability goes three ways for the employees the customers and the investors
we had to find places where rents are more reasonable so we could afford to pay our employees better offer meals at an affordable price tag for our customers and have enough profits for the businesses he says
if you don t yield profits at all it discourages people who want to open better restaurants
then it ll become unsustainable for the food and beverage industry in general
as for the way restaurant kitchens are depicted in pop culture ng feels the shows and movies do get some things right
dramas have exaggerated and romanticized our industry but running a restaurant really does feel like the bear some days it s chaotic energetic and everything is under a very tight timeline
it s about many trivial things but it s an industry all about the humans he says
however ng feels building more humane working conditions doesn t mean the drive to succeed needs to die
you still need to be a kind of freak with lots of obsession to be in this industry he says
so in that way those movies and dramas are accurate
it s like playing a team sport
you need so much training and preparation ahead of the game a lot of team spirit and you need to be present at all times during the games
what has changed is the tendency to mistake toxicity for passion
the culture has changed he says
pr and social media play a big part in modern restaurant life and that has helped encourage a better culture from top management
it encourages the owners to hire the right people and say no to toxic people
rogan thinks the choice is obvious restaurants simply must evolve if they want to succeed
your staff are the future they are your consistency they are your accolade they are the people that are going to take your business further he says
so when you get these people you don t want to lose them
you want to keep them fresh motivated and determined
you re a dinosaur if you can t see that
