passengers can pick from ensuite cabins that sleep two in bunk beds in either the comfort plus or comfort spaces the latter is slightly less spacious
couchettes have four berths in each compartment though they are not ensuite
the real innovation lies in the mini cabins pod like single berths in the couchette cars stacked on top of each other in two layers like a dormitory in which each person can seal off their private space
