As Europe’s rail revolution continues apace one of its major players has decided to bring in an improved service
Austria’s state railway ÖBB which has been leading the revival of overnight services in recent years has unveiled a new strong fleet of night trains which will debut in December
Amid the better all round service one thing stands out a focus on solo travelers with the new trains containing pod like single berths as well as standard couchettes and sleeping cars
How Europe's night trains came back from the dead
The seven carriage trains will each have a capacity of passengers and will be composed of two seating cars three couchettes and two sleeping cars
And they look set to get a major upgrade on traditionally spartan sleeper trains In the sleeping cars all compartments will have their own bathroom including a shower
Beds will be fixed which ÖBB promises will make them more comfortable And there will be more space for bulky luggage including sports equipment strollers and six spots for bikes
Passengers can pick from ensuite cabins that sleep two in bunk beds in either the Comfort Plus or Comfort spaces the latter is slightly less spacious
Couchettes have four berths in each compartment though they are not ensuite
The real innovation lies in the Mini Cabins pod like single berths in the couchette cars stacked on top of each other in two layers like a dormitory in which each person can seal off their private space
Solo travelers will get their privacy along with a tight but does the job space with a mirror in the foldaway breakfast table reading lamp storage area and lockers for shoes and hand bags
Each train will also have an accessible couchette sleeping up to two wheelchair users plus two more people with an accessible toilet
'Hotels on rails' Plans for new network of European sleeper trains unveiled
Leonore Gewessler Austria’s minister for climate action said the new trains make it clear that the future of short and medium haul travel belongs to the train
Taking the train means protecting the climate This is particularly true for night trains That’s why we are working together to further expand the European night train network she said in a statement
Boarding in Vienna in the evening and waking up refreshed in another European metropolis the next morning… will be even easier and more comfortable in the future
The trains have been approved for use in Austria Germany Italy Switzerland and the Netherlands They are due to enter service on December on the Vienna Hamburg and Innsbruck Hamburg routes Tickets go on sale October
