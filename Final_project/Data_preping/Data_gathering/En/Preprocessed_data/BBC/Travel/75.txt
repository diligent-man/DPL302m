Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar alone
I’ll go for one song and suss it out she thought trying to quieten her nerves
Kacie slipped in at the back The club was dark and busy a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking dancing and chatting Before she could even take in the musicians on stage Kacie’s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar
I walked in and he was there Kacie tells CNN Travel today We clocked eyes
Ciao Kacie said back before adding apologetically That’s all the Italian I’ve got for you
It was October Kacie was a year old New Yorker on vacation in Florence It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo It was an exciting and terrifying experience
I was a professional dancer in New York explains Kacie A very exhausting career there’s a lot of toxicity a lot of rejection there’s a lot of politics that come into play and I was feeling a little stuck a little unhappy a little just stagnant if you will
Kacie spent her days auditioning traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store She needed a break and she’d long felt a pull to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation
I kept saying ‘I’ll wait for somebody to go with I’ll wait I’ll wait And then I was waiting for years And so then one night at two in the morning I was like ‘What am I waiting for Life is too short’ So I booked a solo trip to Italy
Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence But in the lead up to the trip she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city’s praises persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint
And that’s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening
I’m really glad that I listened to her says Kacie That’s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence on that earlier day that I wasn’t originally supposed to be there
The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was year old Dario Nencetti a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week
The jazz bar called Jazz Club Firenze was one of Dario’s favorite hangouts He loved the music the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions
That place is let’s say unconventional for Florence Dario tells CNN Travel Usually in Florence there’s like a table for two or three or four people In the jazz club there are big tables so you can sit with strangers and stuff which I love
When Dario realized Kacie didn’t know much Italian beyond ciao they switched to English Dario told Kacie he’d lived in Scotland for a year and they got talking about travel Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he’d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year
We bonded from the beginning says Dario It was really natural really easy conversation
I remember he made me laugh says Kacie And I was like ‘Oh this guy’s interesting So many people ask us ‘How did you know’ And I don’t know how I knew I was just like ‘Oh this is something different’
Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days
He would meet me after his work every night he got off at And we would go out and we would just talk recalls Kacie I instantly fell in love with Florence It’s a very romantic city cobblestone streets and medieval buildings It looks like a painting everywhere you look
I walked in and he was there We clocked eyes
It was a whirlwind two days One evening they sat by Florence’s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until or am It was as though Kacie was in a film somewhere between every millennial’s favorite The Lizzie McGuire Movie and classic Florentine romance A Room with a View
Then the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip It was still like something from a movie only it wasn’t obvious this one had a happy ending
I got on the train and he was standing on the platform And I remember looking out the train and I was so sad she says
As the train pulled away from the station Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York
I just met my future husband in Florence she wrote That’s the guy I’m gonna marry I’m never gonna see him again
Her friend tried to cheer her up
You’re going to Rome she wrote You’ll meet a gladiator
But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn’t replaceable
We never stopped talking We FaceTimed every single day she says
This continued when Kacie was back in the US And before long Dario was planning a trip to visit New York
She texted her mom on vacation ‘I met my husband’ Here’s what happened next
On December Dario arrived in the US Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York
It was really cool to see it through his eyes she says
She showed me the real city says Dario
Then the couple flew to Miami for a week’s vacation
For Kacie and Dario there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship
It was never a decision to be made says Kacie
It just went without saying agrees Dario But I can’t hide it long distance was hard
The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime but tried to visit each other whenever they could
Cut to September Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie
Why don’t I move here he suggested He’d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get go and could see himself there The restaurant scene was incredible If he could find a job and organize the visa it seemed like the ideal scenario
Kacie thought so too so Dario started asking around He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn After a couple of months in limbo his visa was approved
Up until that point every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other says Kacie Saying goodbye in airports sucked It would take like a week to recover
But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past
Her flight was canceled Then she ended up on the doorstep of her future wife
Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city
Then the pandemic hit New York City’s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt Stuck at home Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another
As Kacie puts it she and Dario found many silver linings in this tough time Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta They cat sat They spent long evenings chatting
But as rolled on the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them Dario’s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic renewal was out of the question
For Kacie and Dario it seemed like there were only three viable choices return to long distance get married or move to Italy
Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes the last thing either of them wanted And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future they didn’t feel it was right for them at that point That left moving to Italy
Kacie thought about her career in New York Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing Kacie only felt relief that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty
That was a pretty big wake up call she says I had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing
On top of this Kacie’s New York apartment lease was up If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy it was now
Everything kind of fell into place she says
Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas She applied enrolling in Italian lessons Then Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic
Before stepping on the plane in January Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy She’d never posted much on the platform before but felt inspired to mark this significant life step
When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi Fi her cell phone was blowing up
While stuck inside during mandatory two week quarantine Kacie continued posting TikTok videos Her following continued to grow
While her social media presence was getting bigger for the first few months in Florence Kacie and Dario’s IRL world remained small Italy was still in the thrall of Covid with strict restrictions
But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work Florence started to slowly reopen
I remember the first time going to the Duomo And there was nobody there says Kacie Which is crazy because it’s like the main focus point of Florence And there’s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was
While that moment was surreal even sad Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together They’d come a long way and they were excited for their new life together in Italy
Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario’s family who welcomed her wholeheartedly even if in the early days Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario’s mother didn’t know much English
The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones
Kacie continued to post on social media and her following ballooned After about six months she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time
I think it was a really good idea diving into it he says today It was the right moment the right time and I believed in her from the first moment
They fell in love backpacking through Europe then they lost each other Here’s how they’ve ended up married for years
Almost four years later Kacie’s expanded her social media presence into a travel company running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides Meanwhile Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant
I really love the life we’ve created here says Kacie We live in a beautiful place with great food and he’s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me
The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors but they also savor their downtime They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together
Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now although they don’t rule out a move elsewhere in the future
The solid thing is the fact that we know we’re in it together And that’s what makes it so great says Kacie
She tells Dario I’m not nervous for what the future holds Because I’ve got you
Looking back Kacie finds it serendipitous and surreal to think her spontaneous decision to travel solo in Italy led her to find a new career a new home and the love of her life
There were so many things that had to happen for it to actually happen but it just felt normal and natural like of course this is right and this was supposed to happen she says
You never really know what life has planned for you There’s so many good things waiting You just have to trust it adds Kacie Trust in the process And the path that is meant for you will happen even if it’s not the path that you intended to take for yourself
