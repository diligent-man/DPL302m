in today s not so golden era of domestic air travel checking a suitcase for free is a luxury afforded to few
and those who do check their bags often find themselves stressing out the whole journey wondering if their luggage is actually going to arrive at their destination with them
as a result more travelers than ever are opting to cram their belongings into a carry on bag many of them bulky with wheels
the result a boarding free for all as nervous flyers hover around the gate hoping to be among the first to get on the plane all to secure a tiny piece of overhead real estate near their seat
unfortunately the older versions of those highly coveted bins were not designed with your average carry on roller suitcase in mind
they must be laid down flat leaving a small space above them that is of little use while taking up a good chunk of bin space
enter french aircraft maker airbus and its new airspace l bins designed to be retrofitted in three to five days
first revealed in may these specially shaped overhead compartments promise to create more cabin luggage space than traditional systems
how simply by allowing travelers to load their carry on roller bags vertically instead of having to lay them flat
see the above pic
the bins hold bags that are centimeters height x centimeters width x centimeters depth
made of ultra lightweight composite products the retrofit re uses many parts of the original bin including the sidewall ceiling and lighting to cut down on waste says airbus
flight attendants will likely approve of the new compartments too knowing they can complete boarding procedures while hearing far fewer complaints from flyers about how they don t have a place to stash their bags
one airline has already signed up
from early german flag carrier lufthansa plans to begin retrofitting a aircraft with the new airspace l bins which are produced by germany based elbe flugzeugwerke gmbh efw a subsidiary of st engineering and airbus
we know from talking with airline customers that bigger bins are a clear need to enhance the passenger experience said airbus head of commercial services for europe charbel youzkatli in a statement
luggage has long been a contentious and complicated issue in the aviation world and bigger bins or not that doesn t appear set to change
not everyone brings carry on luggage just to dodge added checked baggage fees many airlines charge extra if you want to bring a suitcase on the plane too
as noted some travelers just love the convenience of not having to wait for their suitcase at the carousel upon arrival
it s also a political issue
just this week european union lawmakers reportedly voted to support a resolution that calls for airlines to stop charging passengers for reasonable sized carry on luggage
but baggage fees are undeniably a huge money maker for airlines
according to the bureau of transportation statistics us airlines earned more than billion in baggage fee revenue in
some airlines justify the fees by pointing to the environmental impact lighter aircraft are more fuel efficient so deterring people from bringing a lot of added weight with them is a good thing
and supporters of fare unbundling say it all works out those who want to pay for extras like checked bags can the rest of us can enjoy cheaper fares
in the end though regardless of traveler preferences most would agree that if better designed bins can speed up the time we spend getting on and off the plane we re all for them
