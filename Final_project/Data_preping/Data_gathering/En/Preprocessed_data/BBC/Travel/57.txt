when an airline places an order for new planes it s given a great opportunity to boost its appeal among travelers looking for maximum comfort particularly where long haul flights are concerned
japan airlines jal has done just that this week unveiling the interiors of its high tech new airbus a aircraft which will become the airline s new flagship for international service after nearly years the carrier says in a statement
jal has ordered of the large widebody planes from airbus
the aircraft was originally going to enter service in late november to be used on the tokyo haneda to new york jfk route
but that timeline has been postponed due to a supply chain disruption affecting the delivery of components says the statement which adds the new aircraft will likely take flight before the end of the year
in the meantime here s a sneak peek at what travelers will get to experience when they finally do board that new a
in an age when amenities like showers and private suites are common offerings in commercial aviation it can be a challenge for an airline to differentiate itself from the competition
this often requires them to offer something unexpected
in the case of jal they ve eliminated the need for headsets in the front end of the plane
both first and business class cabins of the new a s will offer what the airline says is the world s first headphone free stereo
passengers can listen to the inflight entertainment system using the seats built in headrest speakers
the technology created by french aircraft interior designer safran in collaboration with audio tech company devialet was revealed at last year s aircraft interiors expo aix in hamburg germany
cnn travel s francesca street was there to test them out and had this to say about her experience they are no replacement for the cocoon like experience of noise canceling headphones but it s a comfortable set up and feels more akin to the experience of watching a movie on your couch
it would be perfect if you were flying with someone else and wanted to chat and interact as you watched a movie in tandem
the haneda to jfk flight is nearly hours a lot of time in the sky meaning passengers with the funds will be tempted by jal s slick new first and business class suites
the first class cabin will feature just six suites each with a private sliding door in two rows of three
that s two fewer seats than what s offered in the first class cabin on the boeing er jets now servicing many of jal s long haul flights
the latest in luxurious first class airplane suites building up
privacy and space were key considerations here with the airline even eliminating overhead compartments
instead each suite has increased storage space and a small closet
first class passengers have a choice of three seating modes in their suites
there s the full sofa a seat single bed combo and the full double bed
as for size each suite wall rises approximately centimeters inches in height
seat pitch is approximately centimeters with a width of around centimeters the bed stretches out a comfortable centimeters while each monitor is inches
the jal er jets currently serving jal s long haul flights have business class seats
with the new a the airline will increase that number to spread over rows in a configuration
despite this jump jal says in the statement that ample spacing has been prioritized to ensure a comfortable and individual inflight experience
among the biggest changes coming are business class suite doors offering increased privacy and the placement of the overhead storage bins which have been positioned on the window sides only to create a more open atmosphere says jal
size wise the suite walls are about centimeters in height and each monitor is inches
seats have a width of about centimeters with a pitch of centimeters
when converted into a bed the length is approximately centimeters
the airline says special cushioning structures evenly distribute body pressure
there s also an electric privacy partition for those traveling with companions and similar to first class additional storage space inside each suite including a small closet
a common question among travelers is it worth paying the extra for premium economy is there really that big of a difference
in an effort to take away the need for speculation jal is pulling out a few new stops
for instance its adding large partitions between the seats in its premium economy cabin which will be laid out in a configuration
it s also the first premium economy class in the world to introduce electrically operated reclining functionality says the airline
the seat width in this section is about centimeters with a pitch of centimeters
there s also an electric leg rest that can be adjusted to sit horizontally for extra comfort
as for entertainment the new k monitors are inches times larger than the current model says the airline
and that just leaves economy class
it s worth noting that jal was awarded the best economy class airline seat five years in a row at the annual skytrax world airline awards
these new a s are likely a reflection of the airline s goal to keep winning that title jal says in the statement it has further enhanced the spacious legroom and improved the seating for enhanced comfort
each of the plane s recaro designed economy class seats has a width of about centimeters the top end of the industry average and a pitch of centimeters
they are set up in a configuration over rows
meanwhile the k inflight monitors in this cabin are inches and have bluetooth connectivity allowing passengers to use their own headsets while enjoying the inflight entertainment system
