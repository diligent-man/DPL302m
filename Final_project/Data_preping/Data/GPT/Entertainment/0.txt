An amusement park is a place with various attractions, such as rides and games, as well as other events for entertainment purposes. A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme, often featuring multiple areas with different themes. Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation. They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups. While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus on more complex and detailed theming in each of their areas. The oldest amusement park in the world opened in Bakken, Denmark, in 1583. Many modern amusement parks evolved from earlier pleasure resorts that had become popular with the public for day trips or weekend holidays, for example, seaside areas such as Blackpool, United Kingdom, and Coney Island, United States. Today, the amusement park industryis offerings range from large, worldwide type theme parks such as Walt Disney World, SeaWorld Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood, to smaller and medium-sized theme parks such as the Six Flags parks and Cedar Fair parks. The smaller parks offer a variety of attractions, such as water rides, roller coasters, and traditional amusement rides, as well as live entertainment. Some of these parks have also added resort hotels and other amenities to attract visitors for longer stays. The amusement park industry has shown steady attendance and revenue growth over the years. According to the Global Attractions Attendance Report, more than 399 million guests visited the top 10 amusement park groups worldwide in 2013. This figure has grown to more than 480 million guests by 2018. The amusement park industryis offerings continue to evolve to meet changing consumer tastes and technological advancements. New types of entertainment include virtual reality experiences and interactive attractions. In addition, many amusement parks are incorporating educational elements into their attractions to appeal to a broader audience. Despite the ongoing global pandemic, the amusement park industry has shown resilience and adaptability. Many parks have implemented health and safety measures, such as capacity limits, mask requirements, and enhanced cleaning protocols, to ensure the safety of their guests. As the world continues to navigate through these challenging times, the amusement park industry remains committed to providing safe and enjoyable experiences for all its guests. A roller coaster is a type of amusement ride that employs a form of elevated railroad track designed with tight turns, steep slopes, and sometimes inversions. People ride along the track in open cars, and the rides are often found in amusement parks and theme parks around the world. LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained one of the first known patents for a roller coaster design in 1885, related to the Switchback Railway that opened a year earlier at Coney Island. The track in a coaster design does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate. Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained. Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably Wild Mouse roller coasters, run with single cars. The oldest roller coaster still in operation opened in 1902, which is Leap-The-Dips at Lakemont Park in Pennsylvania. There are several types of roller coasters, including steel, wooden, inverted, hybrid, dive, floorless, and flying. They can also be classified into many categories such as height, speed, track layout, train type, and manufacturer. Roller coasters are a major part of American culture and a common language for millions of people. The roller coaster is an iconic symbol of amusement parks and theme parks worldwide. The roller coaster symbolizes the thrill and excitement of not only the ride itself but of life. Roller coasters are also considered by some as a major part of a cultural experience during the summer season. Roller coasters are also commonly used as a metaphor for the ups and downs of life. Roller coasters can also be seen as a symbol of the modernity of the time and the thrill of the future. Roller coasters are also a popular subject in popular culture, such as in films, television series, books, and music videos. Roller coasters have also been influential in shaping the landscape of the amusement park industry. The development and innovation of roller coasters have led to a variety of different types and designs, each offering a unique riding experience. Despite the thrill and excitement that roller coasters provide, safety is a top priority for roller coaster designers and amusement park operators. Roller coasters are subject to rigorous safety inspections and regulations to ensure the safety of riders. As technology continues to advance, roller coasters will continue to evolve, offering even more thrilling and unique experiences for riders. Cinema, also known as film, is a visual art used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely, other sensory stimulations. The word “cinema”, short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it. The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects. Traditionally, films were recorded onto celluloid film stock through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen. Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack. Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages. The individual images that make up a film are called frames. In the projection of traditional celluloid films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears. The perception of motion is partly due to a psychological effect called the phi phenomenon. The name “film” originates from the fact that photographic film also called film stock has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including picture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay, and flick. The most common term in the United States is movie, while in Europe film is preferred. Common terms for the field in general include the big screen, the silver screen, the movies, and cinema; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In early years, the word sheet was sometimes used instead of screen. A swimming pool, swimming bath, wading pool, paddling pool, or simply pool, is a structure designed to hold water to enable swimming or other leisure activities. Pools can be built into the ground or built above ground as a freestanding construction or as part of a building or other larger structure, and are also a common feature aboard ocean-liners and cruise ships. In-ground pools are most commonly constructed from materials such as concrete, natural stone, metal, plastic, or fiberglass, and can be of a custom size and shape or built to a standardized size, the largest of which is the Olympic-size swimming pool. Many health clubs, fitness centers, and private clubs have pools used mostly for exercise or recreation. Many towns and cities provide public pools. Many hotels have pools available for their guests to use at their leisure. Educational facilities such as high schools and universities occasionally have pools for physical education classes, recreational activities, leisure, or competitive athletics such as swimming teams. Hot tubs and spas are pools filled with hot water, used for relaxation or hydrotherapy, and are common in homes, hotels, and health clubs. Special swimming pools are also used for diving, specialized water sports, physical therapy as well as for the training of lifeguards and astronauts. Swimming pools may be heated or unheated. The “Great Bath” at the site of Mohenjo-Daro in modern-day Pakistan was most likely the first swimming pool, dug during the 3rd millennium BC. This pool is 12 by 7 meters, is lined with bricks, and was covered with a tar-based sealant. Ancient Greeks and Romans built artificial pools for athletic training in the palaestras, for nautical games and for military exercises. Roman emperors had private swimming pools in which fish were also kept, hence one of the Latin words for a pool was piscina. The first heated swimming pool was built by Gaius Maecenas of Rome in the 1st century BC. Gaius Maecenas was a rich Roman lord and considered one of the first patrons of arts. Ancient Sinhalese built pairs of pools called “Kuttam Pokuna” in the kingdom of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka in the 4th century BC. They were decorated with flights of steps, punkalas or pots of abundance, and scroll design. Swimming pools became popular in Britain in the mid-19th century. As early as 1837, six indoor pools with diving boards existed in London, England. The Maidstone Swimming Club in Maidstone, Kent is believed to be the oldest surviving swimming club in Britain. It was formed in 1844, in response to concerns over drownings in the River Medway, especially since would-be rescuers would often drown because they themselves could not swim to safety. The club used to swim in the River Medway, and would hold races, diving competitions and water polo matches. The South East Gazette July 1844 reported an aquatic breakfast party: coffee and biscuits were served on a floating raft in the river. The coffee was kept hot over a fire; club members had to tread water and drink coffee at the same time. The last swimmers managed to overturn the raft, to the amusement of 150 spectators. The Amateur Swimming Association was founded in 1869 in England, and the Oxford Swimming Club in 1909 with its home at Temple Cowley Pool. The presence of indoor baths in the cobbled area of Merton Street might have persuaded the less hardy of the aquatic brigade to join. So, bathers gradually became swimmers, and bathing pools became swimming pools. In 1939, Oxford created its first major public indoor pool at Temple Cowley. The modern Olympic Games started in 1896 and included swimming races, after which the popularity of swimming pools began to spread. In the US, the Racquet Club of Philadelphia clubhouse boasts one of the world is first modern above-ground swimming pools. The first swimming pool to go to sea on an ocean liner was installed on the White Star Lineis Adriatic in 1907. The oldest known public swimming pool in America, Underwood Pool, is located in Belmont, Massachusetts. Public swimming pools in the US are typically 25 yards or 25 meters long. In the UK most pools are calibrated in meters, but older pools measured in yards still exist. In the US, pools tend to either be 25 yards, 25 metersor 50 meters. US high schools and the NCAA conduct short course competition. There are also many pools long, so that 3 lengths = 100 m. This pool dimension is commonly used to accommodate water polo.

A museum is an institution that cares for conserves a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance. Many public museums make these items available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. The largest museums are located in major cities throughout the world, while thousands of local museums exist in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public. There are many types of museums, including art museums, natural history museums, science museums, war museums, and childrenis museums. Amongst the worldis largest and most visited museums are the Louvre in Paris, the National Museum of China in Beijing, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., the British Museum and the National Gallery in London, the Museum Island in Berlin, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. As of the 2010s, the continuing acceleration in the digitization of information, combined with the increasing capacity of digital information storage, is causing the traditional model of museums i.e. as static “collections of collections” of three-dimensional specimens and artifacts to expand to include virtual exhibits and high-resolution images of their collections for perusal, study, and exploration from any place with Internet. The city with the largest number of museums is Mexico City with over 128 museums. According to The World Museum Community, there are more than 55,000 museums in 202 countries. The International Council of Museums comprises 30,000 members in 137 countries. The first “public” museums were often accessible only by the middle and upper classes. It could be difficult to gain entrance. In the United States, prior to the 18th century, museums were privately owned. Charles Willson Peale, artist and scientist, opened his museum to the public in Philadelphia in 1786. To disseminate knowledge, he used his museum and its great library to the public in 1791. The Ashmolean Museum, however, founded in 1677 from the personal collection of Elias Ashmole, was set up in the University of Oxford to be open to the public. The British Museum opened to the public in 1759 in Montagu House, on the site of the current building. Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries was largely a result of expanding British colonies and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the British Museum Natural History in South Kensington in 1881. Some of the most historic and world-famous museums in the world are in London, including the British Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, Natural History Museum, and the Tate Modern & Tate Britain. In addition to their primary role as repositories for collections and places for research, museums offer a wide range of educational and cultural programs, from classes and lectures to performances and festivals. Museums are important forums for education, and they often provide spaces for children and families to learn together. Many museums offer programs tailored to children and families, and they may have interactive exhibits that allow children to experience the museum in a more hands-on way. Museums also often host temporary exhibitions, which can include items borrowed from other museums or private collections. These exhibitions can focus on a particular artist, period of history, or theme, and they provide a way for museums to bring new material to their audiences. In recent years, many museums have begun to engage with their communities in new ways, seeking to become centers of community life and encouraging public participation in the preservation and interpretation of the past.

Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias, to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments. In Western countries, most mid-to high-range restaurants serve alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine. Some restaurants serve all the major meals, such as breakfast, lunch, and dinner ., major fast food chains, diners, hotel restaurants, and airport restaurants. Other restaurants may serve only a single meal for example, a pancake house may only serve breakfast or they may serve two meals ., lunch and dinner. The fundamental model of a restaurant is that it prepares food in a central kitchen, allowing customers to choose items from a menu, and serves the customers at their table. The kitchen staff is led by a chef, who creates dishes and coordinates the work of the kitchen staff. The serving staff is led by a manager, who schedules shifts, ensures that the restaurant meets health and safety standards, and handles administrative tasks such as payroll. The dining room staff, led by a head waiter, serve the patrons and tend to their needs, including taking orders, serving food, and cleaning tables. Restaurants are classified or distinguished in many different ways. The primary factors are usually the food itself . vegetarian, seafood, steak; the cuisine . Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, French, Mexican, Thai or the style of offering . tapas bar, a sushi train, a tastet restaurant, a buffet restaurant or a yum cha restaurant.

Restaurants range from inexpensive and informal lunching or dining places catering to people working nearby, with modest food served in simple settings at low prices, to expensive establishments serving refined food and fine wines in a formal setting. In the former case, customers usually wear casual clothing. In the latter case, depending on culture and local traditions, customers might wear semi-casual, semi-formal or formal wear. Typically, at mid- to high-priced restaurants, customers sit at tables, their orders are taken by a waiter, who brings the food when it is ready. After eating, the customers then pay the bill. In some restaurants, such as workplace cafeterias, there are no waiters; the customers use trays, on which they place cold items that they select from a refrigerated container and hot items which they request from cooks, and then they pay a cashier before they sit down. Another restaurant approach which uses few waiters is the buffet restaurant. Customers serve food onto their own plates and then pay at the end of the meal. Buffet restaurants typically still have waiters to serve drinks and alcoholic beverages. Fast food restaurants are also considered a restaurant.
