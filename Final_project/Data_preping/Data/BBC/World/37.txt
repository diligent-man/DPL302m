The US House of Representatives voted Tuesday to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker — a historic moment that threatens to plunge House Republicans even further into chaos and turmoil.
No House speaker has ever before been ousted through the passage of a resolution to remove them.
The vote to oust McCarthy — led by fellow Republican Matt Gaetz — marks a major escalation in tensions for a House GOP conference that has been mired in infighting. It came just days after McCarthy successfully engineered a last-minute bipartisan effort to avert a government shutdown.
The vote was 216-210 with eight Republicans voting to remove McCarthy from the speakership.
McCarthy was elected as speaker in January after a historic stalemate that involved 15 rounds of voting over five days. It was the longest speaker contest in 164 years.
